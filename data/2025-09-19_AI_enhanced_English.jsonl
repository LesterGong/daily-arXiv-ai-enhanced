In this paper, we\nutilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot\nsolution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to\ndynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \\textit{grounding tokens},\nfor grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal\ngrounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query\n(\\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we\npropose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel\ndecomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented\nassembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH\nstrategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action\nsub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and\ntemporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to\nlearn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token\npredictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action\ncues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and\ntemporal related visual regions.

Approaches such as GPTQ\neffectively minimize input-weight product errors during quantization; however,\nrecent empirical studies show that they can increase biased outputs and degrade\nperformance on fairness benchmarks, and it remains unclear which specific\nweights cause this issue. In this work, we draw new links between quantization\nand model fairness by adding explicit group-fairness constraints to the\nquantization objective and introduce Fair-GPTQ, the first quantization method\nexplicitly designed to reduce unfairness in large language models. The added\nconstraints guide the learning of the rounding operation toward less-biased\ntext generation for protected groups. Specifically, we focus on stereotype\ngeneration involving occupational bias and discriminatory language spanning\ngender, race, and religion. Fair-GPTQ has minimal impact on performance,\npreserving at least 90% of baseline accuracy on zero-shot benchmarks, reduces\nunfairness relative to a half-precision model, and retains the memory and speed\nbenefits of 4-bit quantization. We also compare the performance of Fair-GPTQ\nwith existing debiasing methods and find that it achieves performance on par\nwith the iterative null-space projection debiasing approach on\nracial-stereotype benchmarks. Overall, the results validate our theoretical\nsolution to the quantization problem with a group-bias term, highlight its\napplicability for reducing group bias at quantization time in generative\nmodels, and demonstrate that our approach can further be used to analyze\nchannel- and weight-level contributions to fairness during quantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Fair-GPTQ is a novel quantization method that adds group-fairness constraints to reduce biased outputs in large language models while maintaining 4-bit quantization benefits and preserving 90%+ baseline accuracy.", "motivation": "Standard quantization methods like GPTQ reduce computational costs but can increase biased outputs and degrade fairness performance, with unclear causes of these fairness issues.", "method": "Added explicit group-fairness constraints to quantization objective to guide rounding operations toward less-biased text generation, focusing on occupational bias and discriminatory language across gender, race, and religion.", "result": "Minimal performance impact (\u226590% baseline accuracy), reduced unfairness compared to half-precision models, retained memory/speed benefits of 4-bit quantization, and achieved performance comparable to iterative null-space projection debiasing on racial-stereotype benchmarks.", "conclusion": "Validates theoretical solution with group-bias term, demonstrates applicability for reducing group bias during quantization in generative models, and enables analysis of channel- and weight-level contributions to fairness."}}
