Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training these agents to\nperform complex, multi-step reasoning. However, prior RL-based methods often\nrely on sparse or rule-based rewards, which can lead agents to commit to\nsuboptimal or erroneous reasoning paths without the ability to recover. To\naddress these limitations, we propose ReSeek, a novel self-correcting framework\nfor training search agents. Our framework introduces a self-correction\nmechanism that empowers the agent to dynamically identify and recover from\nerroneous search paths during an episode. By invoking a special JUDGE action,\nthe agent can judge the information and re-plan its search strategy. To guide\nthis process, we design a dense, instructive process reward function, which\ndecomposes into a correctness reward for retrieving factual information and a\nutility reward for finding information genuinely useful for the query.\nFurthermore, to mitigate the risk of data contamination in existing datasets,\nwe introduce FictionalHot, a new and challenging benchmark with recently\ncurated questions requiring complex reasoning. Being intuitively reasonable and\npractically simple, extensive experiments show that agents trained with ReSeek\nsignificantly outperform SOTA baselines in task success rate and path\nfaithfulness.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReSeek is a self-correcting framework for training search agents that enables dynamic error recovery during search episodes through a JUDGE action and dense process rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.", "motivation": "Existing RL-based search agents rely on sparse or rule-based rewards, which can lead to commitment to suboptimal reasoning paths without recovery mechanisms.", "method": "Proposes ReSeek framework with self-correction mechanism using JUDGE action, dense instructive process rewards (correctness and utility rewards), and introduces FictionalHot benchmark to avoid data contamination.", "result": "Agents trained with ReSeek significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in task success rate and path faithfulness.", "conclusion": "The self-correcting framework with dynamic error recovery and dense process rewards effectively improves search agent performance on complex reasoning tasks."}}

This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an\nautomated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative\nPV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and\nartificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective\ndistortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial\nreasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images\nthrough geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.\nValidation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust\nperformance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to\nexpert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100\nseconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.\nSimulated energy yield predictions confirm the method's reliability and\napplicability for regional poten tial studies, urban energy planning, and\nbuilding-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) deployment.

We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and\nprecise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and\na prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'\nunderstanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and\nmask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the\nobtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video\ngeneration model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization\ncapability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning\nand overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,\nthereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More\nimportantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation\nmodel, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on\nour newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit\nconsistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are\npublicly available at https://github.com/XWH-A/IMAGEdit.", "AI": {"tldr": "IMAGEdit is a training-free framework for editing multiple subjects in videos by manipulating appearances while preserving non-target regions, using multimodal conditioning and mask sequences without finetuning.", "motivation": "To address the limitations of insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning and mask boundary entanglement in existing video editing methods, enabling editing of any number of subjects in videos.", "method": "Uses a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and prior-based mask retargeting module to generate multimodal information and mask sequences, then feeds these into a pretrained mask-driven video generation model.", "result": "Extensive experiments on MSVBench show IMAGEdit consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods and is compatible with any mask-driven video generation model.", "conclusion": "IMAGEdit significantly expands video editing applicability by overcoming key limitations and demonstrating strong generalization capability for multi-subject editing."}}
