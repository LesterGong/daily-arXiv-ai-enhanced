Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A model-agnostic framework using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with random contrastive sampling to improve radiography report generation accuracy without needing reward models or human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing radiography report generation methods lack sufficient quality for real-world clinical deployment, while large VLMs show promise with LLM-inspired training strategies like alignment techniques.

Method: Introduces Random DPO framework that uses random contrastive sampling to create training pairs, eliminating the need for reward models or human preference data. The approach is model-agnostic and supplements existing models.

Result: Experiments show the method improves clinical performance metrics by up to 5% when applied to three state-of-the-art models, without requiring additional training data.

Conclusion: The proposed Random DPO framework effectively enhances radiography report generation accuracy in a model-agnostic manner, offering a practical solution for clinical deployment without the overhead of reward models or human annotations.

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in
medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload
of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have
yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical
settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment
techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance
RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages
random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need
for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing
three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves
clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional
training data.

### [2] [Improving Autism Detection with Multimodal Behavioral Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21352)
*William Saakyan,Matthias Norden,Lola Eversmann,Simon Kirsch,Muyu Lin,Simon Guendelman,Isabel Dziobek,Hanna Drimalla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a multimodal approach for autism detection using video data, introducing novel gaze descriptors that improve classification accuracy from 64% to 69%, with overall multimodal accuracy reaching 74%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computer-aided autism diagnostic methods struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack real-world generalizability, motivating the development of more robust multimodal approaches.

Method: Analyzed a large, balanced dataset of 168 ASC and 157 non-autistic participants using multimodal analysis of facial expressions, voice prosody, head motion, HRV, and gaze behavior. Introduced novel statistical descriptors for gaze variability and used late fusion for classification.

Result: Novel gaze descriptors improved gaze-based classification from 64% to 69%, aligning with clinical research on gaze aversion. Multimodal late fusion achieved 74% classification accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating behavioral markers across modalities.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support autism assessment through robust multimodal behavioral analysis.

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism
Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods
have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient
video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they
struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world
generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video
dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic
participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most
balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial
expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze
behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel
statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving
gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational
findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we
achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings
highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support
autism assessment.

### [3] [KV-Efficient VLA: A Method of Speed up Vision Language Model with RNN-Gated Chunked KV Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21354)
*Wanshun Xu,Long Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KV-Efficient VLA is a model-agnostic memory compression framework that reduces KV cache memory usage by 36% and speeds up inference by 1.21x through selective context retention and pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models face scalability issues due to quadratic attention costs and unbounded KV memory growth during long-horizon inference, hindering real-time deployment despite improved generalization through scaling.

Method: Partitions KV cache into fixed-size chunks and uses a recurrent gating module to selectively retain high-utility context based on learned utility scores, preserving recent detail while pruning stale memory while maintaining causality.

Result: Achieves up to 1.21x inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction with minimal impact on task success rates.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable inference for VLA models without modifying training pipelines or downstream control logic, addressing critical inference inefficiencies for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and
control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of
attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon
inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone
architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to
real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a
model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by
introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain
high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks
and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical
context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent
fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all
while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x
inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task
success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and
hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training
pipelines or downstream control logic.

### [4] [Phrase-grounded Fact-checking for Automatically Generated Chest X-ray Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21356)
*Razi Mahmood,Diego Machado-Reyes,Joy Wu,Parisa Kaviani,Ken C. L. Wong,Niharika D'Souza,Mannudeep Kalra,Ge Wang,Pingkun Yan,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A phrase-grounded fact-checking model that detects factual errors and hallucinations in automatically generated chest radiology reports by verifying findings and their anatomical locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale vision language models can generate realistic radiology reports but suffer from factual errors and hallucinations, hindering clinical translation. A reliable fact-checking method is needed to ensure report accuracy.

Method: Created synthetic dataset by perturbing findings and locations in ground truth reports, then trained a multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network to verify findings-location pairs with images.

Result: Achieved high accuracy in finding veracity prediction and localization across multiple X-ray datasets, with 0.997 concordance correlation coefficient with ground truth verification for SOTA report generators.

Conclusion: The fact-checking model effectively detects errors in generated radiology reports and shows promise for clinical deployment in radiology workflows.

Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now
possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images.
However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and
hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we
present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects
errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated
chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic
dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth
reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new
multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this
dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms
of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray
datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA
report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation
coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its
utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.

### [5] [MDF-MLLM: Deep Fusion Through Cross-Modal Feature Alignment for Contextually Aware Fundoscopic Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21358)
*Jason Jordan,Mohammadreza Akbari Lor,Peter Koulen,Mei-Ling Shyu,Shu-Ching Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal deep learning architecture (MDF-MLLM) that integrates fine-grained image features from U-Net encoder layers with global textual context in LLaMA 3.2 11B, achieving 94% accuracy for retinal disease classification - a 56% improvement over baseline MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to capture low-level spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases like glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa from fundus images.

Method: MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers into cross-attention blocks within LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based U-Net modulation. Both U-Net and MLLM components were fully fine-tuned during training on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs from three public datasets.

Result: Achieved 94% accuracy on dual-type disease classification, representing 56% improvement over baseline MLLM (60% accuracy). Recall and F1-scores improved by up to 67% and 35% respectively. Ablation studies confirmed multi-depth fusion contributed to substantial gains in spatial reasoning, especially for inherited diseases with rich clinical text.

Conclusion: MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular framework for fundus image classification that outperforms traditional MLLM baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise for clinical decision support systems, with future work exploring synchronized training, more diseases, and segmentation tasks.

Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal
fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual
context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level
spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and
validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from
three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and
inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and
F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers
into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are
patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based
U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease
classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully
fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%,
representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67%
and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the
multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial
reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich
clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular
framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM
baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise
for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work
will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for
more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.

### [6] [Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack on the Safety Filters in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21360)
*Xingkai Peng,Jun Jiang,Meng Tong,Shuai Li,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Kejiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MPDA, a multimodal jailbreak attack that uses image modality to bypass T2I model safety filters by decoupling unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe and harmful components, then iteratively refining NSFW content generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based jailbreak methods for T2I models are limited in bypassing safety filters, and image-based vulnerabilities remain unexplored. The authors aim to develop a more effective multimodal approach to generate NSFW content.

Method: MPDA uses LLMs to decouple unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe and harmful components, rewrites harmful prompts into natural adversarial prompts to bypass filters, and employs visual language models for iterative refinement to maintain semantic consistency.

Result: The proposed MPDA method successfully bypasses T2I model safety filters and generates NSFW content that maintains semantic consistency with original unsafe prompts through multimodal decoupling and iterative refinement.

Conclusion: MPDA demonstrates the vulnerability of T2I models to multimodal jailbreak attacks and highlights the need for more robust safety mechanisms beyond text-based filtering.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating
high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be
abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks.
Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving
potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover,
text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In
response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling
Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic
components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:
firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe
prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that
can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that
trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into
natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model
to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic
consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,
the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to
guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

### [7] [A Mutual Learning Method for Salient Object Detection with intertwined Multi-Supervision--Revised](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21363)
*Runmin Wu,Mengyang Feng,Wenlong Guan,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu,Errui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-task learning approach that combines salient object detection, foreground contour detection, and edge detection to improve saliency map quality by addressing incomplete predictions and boundary inaccuracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for salient object detection suffer from incomplete predictions due to object complexity and inaccurate boundaries caused by convolution/pooling operations.

Method: Proposes intertwined training of saliency detection with foreground contour and edge detection tasks, using a novel mutual learning module (MLM) with multiple network branches trained in mutual learning manner.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven challenging datasets show state-of-the-art results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

Conclusion: The multi-task learning approach with mutual learning modules effectively improves saliency map quality by leveraging complementary supervision from contour and edge detection tasks.

Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object
detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete
predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries
caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these
issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the
supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour
detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and
foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate
saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge
detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise
foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge
prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which
serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple
network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the
performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art
results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

### [8] [MAJORScore: A Novel Metric for Evaluating Multimodal Relevance via Joint Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21365)
*Zhicheng Du,Qingyang Shi,Jiasheng Lu,Yingshan Liang,Xinyu Zhang,Yiran Wang,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAJORScore is a new evaluation metric for multimodal relevance that handles N modalities (N≥3) using multimodal joint representation, outperforming existing bimodal metrics by significant margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal evaluation metrics are limited to bimodal analysis (like CLIP) and cannot properly assess relevance across three or more modalities, which restricts comprehensive multimodal similarity evaluation.

Method: Uses multimodal joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent space, enabling fair relevance scoring across different modalities on a unified scale.

Result: MAJORScore improves by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modalities and reduces by 13.28%-20.54% for inconsistent modalities compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MAJORScore provides a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal datasets and assessing multimodal model performance.

Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding
ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is
used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP).
However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the
associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation
of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation
metric for the relevance of multiple modalities ($N$ modalities, $N\ge3$) via
multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal
joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent
space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing
support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that
MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by
13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves
as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal
datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

### [9] [Safety Assessment of Scaffolding on Construction Site using AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21368)
*Sameer Prabhu,Amit Patwardhan,Ramin Karim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an AI-powered cloud platform for automated scaffolding inspection using point cloud data to detect structural modifications, aiming to replace manual visual inspections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scaffolding inspections are visual, time-intensive, and prone to human errors, which can lead to unsafe conditions on construction sites.

Method: Developed a cloud-based AI platform that processes point cloud data of scaffolding structures and compares it with certified reference data to detect structural modifications.

Result: The system enables automated monitoring of scaffolding by detecting deviations from design rules through AI analysis of point cloud data.

Conclusion: This AI-based approach can reduce manual inspection time and effort while improving construction site safety through more accurate scaffolding monitoring.

Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the
reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural
support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations
from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At
present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or
accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is
time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe
conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute
to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process
and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system
detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified
reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable
automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for
manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.

*Aleksa Jelaca,Ying Jiao,Chang Tian,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automatic prompt engineering framework for counterfactual size control in text-to-image generation, using an image evaluator, prompt rewriter, and DPO-trained ranker to generate images that contradict common-sense patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained controllability in text-to-image generation remains challenging, especially counterfactual controllability (generating images that contradict common-sense patterns), which is crucial for creativity and exploratory applications.

Method: Three-component framework: image evaluator for dataset construction, supervised prompt rewriter for revised prompts, and DPO-trained ranker for optimal prompt selection. Extended Grounded SAM for improved image evaluation.

Result: Created first counterfactual size text-image dataset. Enhanced image evaluator achieved 114% improvement over backbone. Method outperformed state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal
training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge.
Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately
generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major
challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory
applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual
size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an
automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised
prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an
image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful
image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts,
and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct
the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image
evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent
improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a
foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

### [11] [In silico Deep Learning Protocols for Label-Free Super-Resolution Microscopy: A Comparative Study of Network Architectures and SNR Dependence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21376)
*Shiraz S Kaderuppan,Jonathan Mar,Andrew Irvine,Anurag Sharma,Muhammad Ramadan Saifuddin,Wai Leong Eugene Wong,Wai Lok Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates deep neural networks for super-resolution optical microscopy using non-fluorescent phase-contrast techniques, showing that O-Net and Theta-Net architectures perform complementarily depending on image signal-to-noise ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resolution limitations of conventional optical microscopy (~200nm) without requiring expensive specialized equipment or fluorescent techniques, making super-resolution accessible to standard microscope users.

Method: Used two previously developed deep neural network architectures (O-Net and Theta-Net) to super-resolve images from non-fluorescent phase-contrast microscopy (Zernike PCM and DIC) of custom nanoscale test targets calibrated via atomic force microscopy.

Result: Both O-Net and Theta-Net performed well for super-resolution but were complementary rather than competing: O-Net worked better with high signal-to-noise ratio images, while Theta-Net performed better with low signal-to-noise ratio images.

Conclusion: Model architecture and source image signal-to-noise ratio significantly impact super-resolution performance in non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy, even when using identical training datasets and epochs.

Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research
domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis.
Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to
the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with
potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g.
confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution
(SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal
(non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most
microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative
& economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving
non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase
contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in
silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously
(termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a
custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via
atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that
although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving
these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be
considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while
low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings
demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the
source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated
images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy,
even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.

*Yinfeng Yu,Hailong Zhang,Meiling Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMTF-AVN is a novel audio-visual navigation method that uses multi-target architecture and Transformer mechanism to dynamically fuse visual and audio cues, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Replica and Matterport3D datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works on audiovisual embodied navigation overlook deeper perceptual context when fusing visual and audio data, limiting their effectiveness in guiding navigation to audio sources.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN) using multi-target architecture with refined Transformer mechanism to filter and selectively fuse cross-modal information.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Replica and Matterport3D datasets, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Shows strong scalability and generalizability.

Conclusion: DMTF-AVN paves the way for advanced multimodal fusion strategies in robotic navigation by effectively integrating visual observations with auditory signals through dynamic cross-modal fusion.

Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by
dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the
auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively
leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored
basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual
context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for
Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target
architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and
selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica
and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path
efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits
strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal
fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

### [13] [SAEmnesia: Erasing Concepts in Diffusion Models with Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21379)
*Enrico Cassano,Riccardo Renzulli,Marco Nurisso,Mirko Zaffaroni,Alan Perotti,Marco Grangetto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEmnesia is a supervised sparse autoencoder method that creates one-to-one concept-neuron mappings for efficient concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models, reducing search complexity by 96.67% and improving state-of-the-art performance by 9.22%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept unlearning methods require extensive search procedures because concept representations are distributed across multiple latent features, even with sparse autoencoders that reduce neuron polysemanticity.

Method: Supervised sparse autoencoder training with systematic concept labeling that promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization through cross-entropy computation during training.

Result: Achieved 96.67% reduction in hyperparameter search, 9.22% improvement on UnlearnCanvas benchmark, and 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object sequential removal compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SAEmnesia provides an efficient and scalable approach for concept unlearning by creating interpretable representations with specialized neurons, significantly reducing computational overhead while improving performance.

Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires
precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent
space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity
(i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network,
individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple
latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning.
We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that
promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept
labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization.
Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept
associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational
overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during
training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces
hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the
UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the
state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior
scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object
removal.

### [14] [Coreset selection based on Intra-class diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21380)
*Imran Ashraf,Mukhtar Ullah,Muhammad Faisal Nadeem,Muhammad Nouman Noor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an intelligent coreset selection method for deep learning in biomedical image classification that captures intra-class diversity through clustering, outperforming random sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models require substantial computational resources for training and hyperparameter tuning, especially with large datasets. Random sampling for coreset selection fails to capture intra-class diversity and is biased towards dominant classes in imbalanced datasets.

Method: Introduces a lightweight mechanism for coreset selection that extracts intra-class diversity by forming per-class clusters, which are then utilized for final sampling to create representative subsets of the original dataset.

Result: Extensive classification experiments on a biomedical imaging dataset show the proposed scheme outperforms random sampling on several performance metrics under uniform conditions.

Conclusion: The intelligent coreset selection method effectively addresses the limitations of random sampling by capturing intra-class diversity, providing a more representative subset for training deep learning models while reducing computational demands.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the
healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning
intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex
diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL
models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand
substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive
datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased
due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal
hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the
growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently
gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a
subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,
referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original
dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing
random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of
the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias
towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has
inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class
diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,
lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method
to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized
for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology
by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical
imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the
random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

### [15] [The LongiMam model for improved breast cancer risk prediction using longitudinal mammograms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21383)
*Manel Rakez,Thomas Louis,Julien Guillaumin,Foucauld Chamming's,Pierre Fillard,Brice Amadeo,Virginie Rondeau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongiMam is a deep learning model that integrates current and up to four prior mammograms using CNN and RNN to improve breast cancer prediction, showing consistent performance improvements across various scenarios and risk groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for breast cancer screening use limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings with imbalanced outcomes and heterogeneous follow-up.

Method: Developed LongiMam - an end-to-end deep learning model combining convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture spatial and temporal patterns from current and up to four prior mammograms.

Result: LongiMam consistently improved prediction when prior mammograms were included, with combination of prior and current visits outperforming single-visit models. Model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density over time.

Conclusion: Longitudinal modeling enhances breast cancer prediction and supports using repeated mammograms to refine risk stratification in screening programs.

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage
longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or
limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by
imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed
LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up
to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent
neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast
cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based
screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of
clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and
composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when
prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits
outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well,
highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information.
Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups,
including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover,
the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density
over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances
breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine
risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as
open-source software.

*Laurent Mertens,Elahe' Yargholi,Laura Van Hove,Hans Op de Beeck,Jan Van den Stock,Joost Vennekens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores whether CNN-brain correspondences extend to social cognition (image valence appraisal), finding CNNs struggle with higher-order processing and presenting Object2Brain framework to analyze object class influences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if CNN-brain correspondences observed in general visual perception also hold for more complex social cognition processes like image valence appraisal.

Method: Correlation analysis between CNN architectures and human behavioral/fMRI data for image valence appraisal, plus Object2Brain framework combining GradCAM and object detection at CNN-filter level.

Result: CNNs struggle to go beyond simple visual processing and do not reflect higher-order brain processing for social cognition; different architectures show different object class sensitivities despite similar correlation trends.

Conclusion: CNN-brain correspondences are limited for complex social cognition tasks, and Object2Brain reveals architecture-specific object class sensitivities that influence human correlation patterns.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular type of computer model
that have proven their worth in many computer vision tasks. Moreover, they form
an interesting study object for the field of psychology, with shown
correspondences between the workings of CNNs and the human brain. However,
these correspondences have so far mostly been studied in the context of general
visual perception. In contrast, this paper explores to what extent this
correspondence also holds for a more complex brain process, namely social
cognition. To this end, we assess the alignment between popular CNN
architectures and both human behavioral and fMRI data for image valence
appraisal through a correlation analysis. We show that for this task CNNs
struggle to go beyond simple visual processing, and do not seem to reflect
higher-order brain processing. Furthermore, we present Object2Brain, a novel
framework that combines GradCAM and object detection at the CNN-filter level
with the aforementioned correlation analysis to study the influence of
different object classes on the CNN-to-human correlations. Despite similar
correlation trends, different CNN architectures are shown to display different
object class sensitivities.

### [17] [Debugging Concept Bottleneck Models through Removal and Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21385)
*Eric Enouen,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBDebug is an interpretable debugging framework for Concept Bottleneck Models that removes undesired concepts and retrains models using concept-level feedback converted to sample-level labels for bias mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional concept interventions in CBMs fail to address systemic misalignment between model reasoning and expert knowledge, particularly when models learn shortcuts from biased data.

Method: Two-step process: 1) Removal - experts identify and remove undesired concepts using explanations; 2) Retraining - CBDebug converts concept-level feedback to sample-level auxiliary labels for supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation.

Result: CBDebug significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious correlations.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces model reliance on undesired concepts by leveraging CBM interpretability to bridge concept-level feedback and sample-level training interventions.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to
predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the
CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time.
However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the
CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from
biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging
framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining.
In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove
any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel
method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting
concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels
are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation,
reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework
with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug
significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM
architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious
correlations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShipwreckFinder is an open-source QGIS plugin that automatically detects shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data using deep learning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of bathymetric data for shipwreck detection is time-consuming and requires expert analysis, creating a need for automated tools.

Method: Developed a deep learning model trained on shipwreck data from Great Lakes and Irish coasts, enhanced with synthetic data generation, integrated into QGIS for automated preprocessing, inference, and output generation.

Result: Demonstrated superior segmentation performance compared to deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and classical inverse sinkhole detection method.

Conclusion: ShipwreckFinder provides an effective open-source solution for automated shipwreck detection, making the process more efficient and accessible.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ShipwreckFinder, an open-source QGIS plugin that
detects shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data. Shipwrecks are an important
historical marker of maritime history, and can be discovered through manual
inspection of bathymetric data. However, this is a time-consuming process and
often requires expert analysis. Our proposed tool allows users to automatically
preprocess bathymetry data, perform deep learning inference, threshold model
outputs, and produce either pixel-wise segmentation masks or bounding boxes of
predicted shipwrecks. The backbone of this open-source tool is a deep learning
model, which is trained on a variety of shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and
the coasts of Ireland. Additionally, we employ synthetic data generation in
order to increase the size and diversity of our dataset. We demonstrate
superior segmentation performance with our open-source tool and training
pipeline as compared to a deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and a more
classical inverse sinkhole detection method. The open-source tool can be found

### [19] [Do Sparse Subnetworks Exhibit Cognitively Aligned Attention? Effects of Pruning on Saliency Map Fidelity, Sparsity, and Concept Coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21387)
*Sanish Suwal,Dipkamal Bhusal,Michael Clifford,Nidhi Rastogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how magnitude-based pruning affects neural network interpretability, finding that light-to-moderate pruning improves saliency map quality and concept coherence, while aggressive pruning reduces interpretability despite maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of neural network pruning on model interpretability, as previous work focused on performance preservation but neglected interpretability effects.

Method: Used ResNet-18 on ImageNette with magnitude-based pruning followed by fine-tuning, evaluated using Vanilla Gradients and Integrated Gradients for saliency maps, and CRAFT-based concept extraction for semantic coherence analysis.

Result: Light-to-moderate pruning improved saliency-map focus and faithfulness while maintaining distinct concepts; aggressive pruning merged features, reducing sparsity and concept coherence despite preserved accuracy.

Conclusion: Pruning can shape representations toward human-aligned attention patterns, but excessive pruning undermines interpretability despite maintaining performance.

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while
preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability
remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning
followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level
concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare
post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG)
across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply
CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of
learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves
saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically
meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous
features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite
maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape
internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns,
excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TUN3D is the first method for joint layout estimation and 3D object detection from multi-view images without requiring ground-truth camera poses or depth supervision, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches rely on point cloud input, which limits practical applications since most consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data is more common. There's a need for methods that work directly from multi-view images without requiring ground-truth camera poses or depth supervision.

Method: Builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone with two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout estimation using a novel parametric wall representation. Works with multi-view images as input without ground-truth camera poses or depth supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging benchmarks: using ground-truth point clouds, posed images, and unposed images. Performs on par with specialized 3D object detection methods while significantly advancing layout estimation.

Conclusion: TUN3D sets a new benchmark in holistic indoor scene understanding by enabling joint layout estimation and 3D object detection directly from multi-view images without requiring depth sensors or ground-truth camera poses.

Abstract: Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor
scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of a compact yet
semantically rich spatial representation of a scene. Existing approaches
typically rely on point cloud input, which poses a major limitation since most
consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more
common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint
layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view
images as input, and does not require ground-truth camera poses or depth
supervision. Our approach builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone
and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout
estimation, leveraging a novel and effective parametric wall representation.
Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth
point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While
performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D
significantly advances layout estimation, setting a new benchmark in holistic
indoor scene understanding. Code is available at

*Qiyu Ma,Wanli Ni,Zhijin Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative semantic communication system that segments images into key and non-key regions for optimized transmission, using different processing methods for each region while employing lightweight deployment strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic communication methods neglect the varying importance of different image regions, potentially compromising reconstruction quality of visually critical content.

Method: Segment images into key and non-key regions; process key regions with image-oriented semantic encoder, compress non-key regions via image-to-text modeling; employ model quantization and low-rank adaptation for lightweight deployment.

Result: Outperforms traditional methods in both semantic fidelity and visual quality for image transmission tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively enhances image transmission by refining semantic granularity and optimizing resource utilization without performance sacrifice.

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy
of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these
advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance
of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction
quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an
innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic
granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions,
which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image
oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed
through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the
substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the
proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model
quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly
boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in
terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its
effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

### [23] [Skeleton Sparsification and Densification Scale-Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21398)
*Julia Gierke,Pascal Peter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces skeletonisation scale-spaces, a framework that combines medial axis sparsification with scale-space principles to achieve hierarchical shape simplification while maintaining key properties like equivariance and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The medial axis (Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton) is sensitive to noise and boundary variations, leading to undesirable skeletal branches. Classical pruning methods address this but lack formal scale-space properties.

Method: Proposes skeletonisation scale-spaces that leverage sparsification of the medial axis to create hierarchical shape simplifications. The framework includes both continuous and discrete formulations, and extends to densification for inverse progression from coarse to fine scales.

Result: The framework satisfies key scale-space properties including hierarchical architecture, controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate effectiveness for robust skeletonisation, shape compression, and stiffness enhancement.

Conclusion: Skeletonisation scale-spaces provide a principled approach to hierarchical shape simplification that overcomes limitations of conventional pruning methods, with practical applications in various domains including additive manufacturing.

Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton, also known as the medial axis, is a powerful
shape descriptor that represents binary objects in terms of the centres of
maximal inscribed discs. Despite its broad applicability, the medial axis
suffers from sensitivity to noise: minor boundary variations can lead to
disproportionately large and undesirable expansions of the skeleton. Classical
pruning methods mitigate this shortcoming by systematically removing extraneous
skeletal branches. This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the
principle of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of
reconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.
  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They
leverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical
simplification of shapes. Unlike conventional pruning, our framework inherently
satisfies key scale-space properties such as hierarchical architecture,
controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. We
provide a rigorous theoretical foundation in both continuous and discrete
formulations and extend the concept further with densification. This allows
inverse progression from coarse to fine scales and can even reach beyond the
original skeleton to produce overcomplete shape representations with relevancy
for practical applications.
  Through proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework for practical tasks including robust skeletonisation, shape
compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution climate projections are needed for local decision-making, but current projections have low spatial resolution (12.5 km) which limits their usability.

Method: Train single-image super-resolution models on high-resolution observational gridded data, then apply them to low-resolution climate projections. Use climate indicator-based assessment with observed climate indices from weather stations for evaluation.

Result: Experiments on daily mean temperature show that super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution projections.

Conclusion: Single-image super-resolution models are effective for statistically downscaling climate projections to higher resolution while maintaining climate indicator accuracy.

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making.
However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5
km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging
single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate
projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are
unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational
gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We
propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices
computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate
projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections.
Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image
super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing
the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models are vulnerable to image-based jailbreak attacks that can bypass safety alignments, and existing methods have unstable performance and visible perturbations.

Method: Proposes Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation (JaiLIP) that minimizes a joint objective combining MSE loss between clean/adversarial images and the model's harmful-output loss.

Result: Generates highly effective and imperceptible adversarial images that outperform existing methods in toxicity generation, with practical demonstrations in transportation domain.

Conclusion: Highlights the practical challenges of image-based jailbreak attacks and emphasizes the need for efficient defense mechanisms for VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating
multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment
concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of
attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated
that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful
outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to
jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In
this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation
(JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint
objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and
adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed
method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and
Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly
effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods
in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the
transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text
generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges
of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms
for VLMs.

Motivation: To quantify the gap between automated species identification systems and human expert performance, and compare the uncertainty in both approaches.

Method: Organized a challenge with 19 deep-learning systems evaluated against 9 expert botanists specializing in French flora.

Result: State-of-the-art deep learning models achieved performance close to the most advanced human expertise.

Conclusion: Automated plant identification systems have reached near-human expert level performance, marking significant progress in the field.

Abstract: Automated identification of plants and animals has improved considerably in
the last few years, in particular thanks to the recent advances in deep
learning. The next big question is how far such automated systems are from the
human expertise. Indeed, even the best experts are sometimes confused and/or
disagree between each others when validating visual or audio observations of
living organism. A picture actually contains only a partial information that is
usually not sufficient to determine the right species with certainty.
Quantifying this uncertainty and comparing it to the performance of automated
systems is of high interest for both computer scientists and expert
naturalists. The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge presented in this paper was
designed to allow this comparison between human experts and automated systems.
In total, 19 deep-learning systems implemented by 4 different research teams
were evaluated with regard to 9 expert botanists of the French flora. The main
outcome of this work is that the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning
models is now close to the most advanced human expertise. This paper presents
more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the
approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and
provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: QuadGPT is the first autoregressive framework for direct quadrilateral mesh generation, using unified tokenization and RL fine-tuning to surpass triangle-to-quad conversion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods generate quad meshes by first creating triangle meshes then merging them, which produces poor topology quality.

Method: Autoregressive sequence prediction with unified tokenization for mixed triangle/quad topologies and specialized RL fine-tuning (tDPO) for generation quality.

Result: Significantly surpasses previous triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and topological quality.

Conclusion: Establishes new benchmark for native quad-mesh generation and demonstrates power of combining autoregressive models with topology-aware RL refinement.

Abstract: The generation of quadrilateral-dominant meshes is a cornerstone of
professional 3D content creation. However, existing generative models generate
quad meshes by first generating triangle meshes and then merging triangles into
quadrilaterals with some specific rules, which typically produces quad meshes
with poor topology. In this paper, we introduce QuadGPT, the first
autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes in an end-to-end
manner. QuadGPT formulates this as a sequence prediction paradigm,
distinguished by two key innovations: a unified tokenization method to handle
mixed topologies of triangles and quadrilaterals, and a specialized
Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method tDPO for better generation quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadGPT significantly surpasses previous
triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and
topological quality. Our work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh
generation and showcases the power of combining large-scale autoregressive
models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

*Jiaqi Liu,Lan Zhang,Xiaoyong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyME is a dynamic multi-concept erasure framework that uses lightweight LoRA adapters with bi-level orthogonality constraints to selectively remove copyrighted styles and protected concepts from text-to-image diffusion models, outperforming static erasure methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models inadvertently reproduce copyrighted styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns. Existing concept erasure methods don't scale to practical settings with multiple and potentially conflicting concepts due to their static approach.

Method: Proposes DyME framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and dynamically composes only needed ones at inference. Uses bi-level orthogonality constraints at feature and parameter levels to prevent adapter interference. Introduces ErasureBench-H benchmark for evaluation.

Result: DyME consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on ErasureBench-H and standard datasets, achieving higher multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation compared to static methods.

Conclusion: The modular design with dynamic adapter composition and orthogonality constraints enables effective multi-concept erasure in diffusion models, addressing the limitations of static erasure approaches in practical settings.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted
styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns.
Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such
concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to
practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting
concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single
checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the
actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world
usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success
and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand
erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and
dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design
enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes
interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related
concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality
constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling
representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further
develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with
brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across
semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and
standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher
multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

Method: Training uses generator-evaluator interplay: generator produces responses conditioned on target ratings, and mismatched responses are discarded. Specialized for evaluating text outputs from video understanding models.

Result: VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM baselines (Qwen2.5-VL 32B/72B) on 3 out of 4 meta-evaluation benchmarks. LLM judges perform worse than MLLM judges, and chain-of-thought reasoning doesn't help, showing video inputs are crucial.

Conclusion: VideoJudge demonstrates that specialized MLLM judges can effectively evaluate video understanding tasks, with video inputs being essential for accurate assessment.

Abstract: Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly
used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of
human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is
costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video
understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce
VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from
video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on
videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a
generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses
conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's
rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks,
VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B
and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than
MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve
performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation
of video understanding tasks.

### [30] [Residual Vector Quantization For Communication-Efficient Multi-Agent Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21464)
*Dereje Shenkut,B. V. K Vijaya Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVQom is a learned feature codec for multi-agent collaborative perception that achieves 273x to 1365x compression (6-30 bpp) while preserving spatial identity and maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication bandwidth constraints limit scalability in multi-agent collaborative perception systems like autonomous vehicles and robots, requiring efficient compression methods.

Method: End-to-end method using bottleneck network for feature dimension compression followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ), transmitting only per-pixel code indices.

Result: Achieves 273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp on DAIR-V2X dataset; matches or outperforms raw-feature CP at 18 bpp (455x compression).

Conclusion: ReVQom enables efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with ultra-low-bandwidth operation, advancing practical V2X deployment.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) improves scene understanding by
sharing information across connected agents such as autonomous vehicles,
unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots. Communication bandwidth, however,
constrains scalability. We present ReVQom, a learned feature codec that
preserves spatial identity while compressing intermediate features. ReVQom is
an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck
network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). This allows
only per-pixel code indices to be transmitted, reducing payloads from 8192 bits
per pixel (bpp) of uncompressed 32-bit float features to 6-30 bpp per agent
with minimal accuracy loss. On DAIR-V2X real-world CP dataset, ReVQom achieves
273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp. At 18 bpp (455x),
ReVQom matches or outperforms raw-feature CP, and at 6-12 bpp it enables
ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation. ReVQom allows
efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with a step toward
practical V2X deployment.

### [31] [Gender Stereotypes in Professional Roles Among Saudis: An Analytical Study of AI-Generated Images Using Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21466)
*Khaloud S. AlKhalifah,Malak Mashaabi,Hend Al-Khalifa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text-to-Image AI models (ImageFX, DALL-E V3, Grok) show strong gender stereotyping and cultural inaccuracies when generating Saudi professionals, with DALL-E V3 being the most biased at 96% male outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how contemporary Text-to-Image AI models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural inaccuracies in depictions of Saudi Arabian professionals.

Method: Analyzed 1,006 images from three AI models using neutral prompts for 56 Saudi professions. Two Saudi annotators evaluated images on five dimensions (gender, clothing, background, activities, age) with a third researcher adjudicating disagreements, resulting in 10,100 judgements.

Result: Strong gender imbalance observed: ImageFX 85% male, Grok 86.6% male, DALL-E V3 96% male. Cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and activities were frequent. Counter-stereotypical images often resulted from cultural misinterpretations rather than progressive portrayals.

Conclusion: Current models mirror societal biases in training data and offer limited reflection of Saudi labor market dynamics. Need for more diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation frameworks for equitable outputs.

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image
artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural
inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We
analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse
Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated
each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance,
background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior
researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding
10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,
with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\%
male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender
stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical
roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted
activities were frequently observed across all three models.
Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations
rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models
mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,
offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics
and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more
diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation
frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

*Zixuan Wang,Yu Sun,Hongwei Wang,Baoyu Jing,Xiang Shen,Xin Dong,Zhuolin Hao,Hongyu Xiong,Yang Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model pretraining approach for unified inappropriate content detection in short videos, using three targeted tasks to bridge distribution gaps and improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches require separate models for each content issue type, needing extensive human-labeled data and lacking cross-issue generalization capabilities.

Method: Three pretraining tasks: Caption (enhance video detail perception), Visual Question Answering (deepen understanding of issue definitions), and Chain-of-Thought (enhance reasoning capability).

Result: Significant performance improvement in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning settings, with strong generalization to previously unseen emergent issues.

Conclusion: The proposed pretraining paradigm effectively addresses distribution gaps and complex issue definitions, enabling unified inappropriate content detection with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of
inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically
train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which
requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We
propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining
paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the
distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data
of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted
pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of
video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the
MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3)
\textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability.
Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves
the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

*Yu Zhao,Wei-Ning Chen,Huseyin Atahan Inan,Samuel Kessler,Lu Wang,Lukas Wutschitz,Fangkai Yang,Chaoyun Zhang,Pasquale Minervini,Saravan Rajmohan,Robert Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reframes GUI grounding as an interactive search task using cursor movement instead of direct coordinate prediction, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional coordinate prediction methods for GUI grounding fail with high-resolution GUI images and complex layouts in Vision Language Models (VLMs).

Method: Proposes GUI-Cursor, which treats GUI grounding as an interactive search task where the VLM generates cursor movement actions based on spatial relations and movement history, trained with multi-step online reinforcement learning.

Result: GUI-Cursor improves GUI grounding accuracy significantly: ScreenSpot-v2 (88.8% → 93.9%) and ScreenSpot-Pro (26.8% → 56.5%). It solves problems within two steps for 95% of instances and adapts step count for difficult examples.

Conclusion: Interactive search with cursor movement is more effective than direct coordinate prediction for GUI grounding, enabling better spatial reasoning and visual feedback alignment.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate
prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen
coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision
Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when
processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this
issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the
VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At
each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial
relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the
target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the
rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its
predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI
grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning
with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show
that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy
and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow
93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe
that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of
instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.

*Prasanna Reddy Pulakurthi,Jiamian Wang,Majid Rabbani,Sohail Dianat,Raghuveer Rao,Zhiqiang Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-CoT is an explainable text-to-video retrieval framework that replaces traditional embedding models with LLM Chain-of-Thought reasoning to provide interpretable ranking results and improve retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video retrieval systems have two main limitations: they are compromised by low-quality text-video data pairs that are hard to identify, and cosine similarity alone provides no explanation for ranking results, limiting interpretability.

Method: Proposes X-CoT framework that uses LLM Chain-of-Thought reasoning instead of embedding models. Expands benchmarks with additional video annotations, and devises a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise comparison steps for detailed reasoning and complete ranking.

Result: X-CoT empirically improves retrieval performance, produces detailed rationales, and facilitates model behavior and data quality analysis.

Conclusion: The X-CoT framework successfully addresses interpretability issues in text-to-video retrieval while improving performance and enabling better analysis of model behavior and data quality.

Abstract: Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for
feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this
design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could
compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine
similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the
interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to
assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes
X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of
the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing
benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding
and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise
comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT
empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed
rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method that adapts unsupervised defect detection for surgical instruments by integrating background masking, patch-based analysis, and domain adaptation to overcome limitations of existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of surgical instruments is error-prone, and existing automated methods trained on natural/industrial images fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain, leading to false positives, poor sensitivity to small defects, and domain shift issues.

Method: Proposes a versatile method integrating background masking to reduce false positives from textured backgrounds, patch-based analysis strategy for detecting small subtle defects, and efficient domain adaptation to capture instrument-specific features.

Result: The method overcomes limitations of existing approaches and enables reliable detection of fine-grained defects in surgical instrument imagery.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the domain-specific challenges in surgical instrument defect detection through targeted adaptations of unsupervised methods.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of surgical instruments requires reliable detection of
visual defects. However, manual inspection is prone to error, and existing
automated defect detection methods, typically trained on natural/industrial
images, fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain. We demonstrate
that simply applying or fine-tuning these approaches leads to issues: false
positive detections arising from textured backgrounds, poor sensitivity to
small, subtle defects, and inadequate capture of instrument-specific features
due to domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile method
that adapts unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical
instruments. By integrating background masking, a patch-based analysis
strategy, and efficient domain adaptation, our method overcomes these
limitations, enabling the reliable detection of fine-grained defects in
surgical instrument imagery.

*Junno Yun,Yaşar Utku Alçalar,Mehmet Akçakaya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Linear SEParability (LSEP) regularization for training diffusion models, eliminating the need for external encoders while improving representation quality and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment-based approaches require computationally expensive pretrained encoders, creating dependency on external models and increasing training costs.

Method: Introduces LSEP regularization that promotes linear separability of intermediate layer representations, incorporating linear probing directly into learning dynamics without auxiliary encoders.

Result: Achieves substantial improvements in training efficiency and generation quality, with FID of 1.46 on 256×256 ImageNet dataset using flow-based transformer architectures like SiTs.

Conclusion: LSEP provides an effective alternative to encoder-based alignment methods, improving representation quality while reducing computational dependencies and costs.

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently
emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations
in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation
alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which
improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing.
Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained
encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we
propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the
Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP
eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment,
while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning
dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs,
achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

### [37] [Enhancing Contrastive Learning for Geolocalization by Discovering Hard Negatives on Semivariograms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21573)
*Boyi Chen,Zhangyu Wang,Fabian Deuser,Johann Maximilian Zollner,Martin Werner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A spatially regularized contrastive learning method that uses semivariograms to model spatial dependencies, addressing false negatives and hard negatives in image-based geo-localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive learning methods for geo-localization ignore spatial dependencies, leading to issues with false negatives (visually/geographically similar images labeled as negatives) and hard negatives (visually similar but geographically distant images).

Method: Proposes a spatially regularized contrastive learning strategy that integrates semivariograms - a geostatistical tool - to model spatial correlation between image feature distance and geographical distance, using this to identify hard negatives and false negatives.

Result: The method improves image-based geo-localization performance on the OSV5M dataset, particularly at finer granularity, by explicitly modeling spatial priors.

Conclusion: Explicitly incorporating spatial dependencies through semivariograms enhances contrastive learning for geo-localization by better handling spatial relationships and improving discrimination of challenging cases.

Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is
challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the
lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning
methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view
images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial
dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue
of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically
similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address
this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning
strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for
modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the
semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their
geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial
correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual
dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard
negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and
evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling
spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly
at finer granularity.

TL;DR: X-Streamer is an end-to-end multimodal framework that transforms static portraits into real-time interactive digital humans capable of infinite text, speech, and video interactions through a unified Thinker-Actor architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create digital human agents capable of persistent, intelligent audiovisual interactions from static portraits, enabling real-time open-ended video calls with streaming multimodal inputs.

Method: Uses a Thinker-Actor dual-transformer architecture: Thinker module (pretrained large language-speech model) for multimodal reasoning, Actor module (chunk-wise autoregressive diffusion model) for generating synchronized multimodal responses. Features inter/intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned positional embeddings, chunk-wise diffusion forcing, and global identity referencing.

Result: X-Streamer runs in real-time on two A100 GPUs, sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary portraits with fine-grained cross-modality alignment.

Conclusion: The framework enables unified world modeling of interactive digital humans, paving the way for persistent and intelligent audiovisual interactions from static portraits.

Abstract: We introduce X-Streamer, an end-to-end multimodal human world modeling
framework for building digital human agents capable of infinite interactions
across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture. Starting
from a single portrait, X-Streamer enables real-time, open-ended video calls
driven by streaming multimodal inputs. At its core is a Thinker-Actor
dual-transformer architecture that unifies multimodal understanding and
generation, turning a static portrait into persistent and intelligent
audiovisual interactions. The Thinker module perceives and reasons over
streaming user inputs, while its hidden states are translated by the Actor into
synchronized multimodal streams in real time. Concretely, the Thinker leverages
a pretrained large language-speech model, while the Actor employs a chunk-wise
autoregressive diffusion model that cross-attends to the Thinker's hidden
states to produce time-aligned multimodal responses with interleaved discrete
text and audio tokens and continuous video latents. To ensure long-horizon
stability, we design inter- and intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned
multimodal positional embeddings for fine-grained cross-modality alignment and
context retention, further reinforced by chunk-wise diffusion forcing and
global identity referencing. X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs,
sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary
portraits and paving the way toward unified world modeling of interactive
digital humans.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for forecasting object motion from single images by generating dense trajectory grids instead of pixels, achieving better accuracy and diversity than prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of video generators in forecasting motion from single images, even in simple physical scenarios, by focusing directly on motion modeling rather than pixel generation.

Method: Formulates motion forecasting as conditional generation of dense trajectory grids using an architecture similar to modern video generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels.

Result: The approach captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators, with effectiveness demonstrated on robotics applications and real-world intuitive physics datasets.

Conclusion: Directly modeling motion trajectories is more effective for motion forecasting from single images than pixel-based video generation, which struggles with this task due to the overhead of pixel generation.

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e.,
predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to
observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to
them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory
grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video
generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach
captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and
diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively
evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on
downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on
real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video
generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with
forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such
as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on
such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating
pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

TL;DR: Comparative analysis shows DINOv3 excels at pose recognition with superior clustering and discrimination, while V-JEPA2 provides more consistent performance across all action types with temporal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand architectural trade-offs between spatial (DINOv3) and temporal (V-JEPA2) self-supervised learning approaches for video action recognition.

Method: Evaluated both architectures on UCF Sports dataset using classification accuracy, clustering performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination metrics.

Result: DINOv3 achieved better clustering (Silhouette: 0.31 vs 0.21) and discrimination (6.16x separation), while V-JEPA2 had lower performance variance (0.094 vs 0.288) and more balanced performance across action types.

Conclusion: Architectural choices involve trade-offs: DINOv3 excels for pose recognition but struggles with motion-dependent actions, while V-JEPA2 provides reliable performance across diverse actions through temporal modeling.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two prominent
self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition: DINOv3,
which processes frames independently through spatial feature extraction, and
V-JEPA2, which employs joint temporal modeling across video sequences. We
evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality
through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering
performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our
analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior
clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates
exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for
pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across
all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs
0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial
processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded
performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling
provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories.
These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices
in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting
appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and
reliability constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLCE is a multimodal system that generates comprehensive disaster damage descriptions from satellite and UAV imagery, outperforming baseline models in informativeness while maintaining semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional damage assessment methods are slow and dangerous after natural disasters. Current computer vision approaches only provide classification labels or segmentation masks, lacking comprehensive situational understanding.

Method: Dual-architecture approach: CNN-LSTM with ResNet50 backbone for satellite imagery (xBD dataset) and Vision Transformer (ViT) for UAV pictures (RescueNet dataset), enhanced with external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet.

Result: VLCE significantly outperforms baseline models (LLaVA and QwenVL), achieving up to 95.33% on InfoMetIC for caption informativeness while maintaining competitive semantic alignment measured by CLIPScore.

Conclusion: The dual-architecture system shows significant potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating production of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet,
conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although
satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives
of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just
classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to
deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language
Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive,
contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a
dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone
pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset.
Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to
expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in
comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing
CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness.
Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models,
attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive
semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant
potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production
of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework using multiple representational similarity metrics to analyze and classify vision models, revealing that geometry and tuning carry family-specific signatures while linearly decodable information is broadly shared across model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand which aspects of vision model representations are shared across different architectures and training paradigms versus which reflect distinctive computational strategies, given the wide diversity in current vision models.

Method: Leverages a suite of representational similarity metrics (RSA, Soft Matching, Linear Predictivity) capturing different facets, and adapts Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) from multi-omics integration to combine these complementary metrics for enhanced family separation.

Result: Geometry and tuning metrics yield strong family discrimination, while linear decodability shows weaker separation. SNF achieves substantially sharper family separation than individual metrics, revealing clustering patterns where supervised ResNets and ViTs form distinct clusters, self-supervised models group across architectures, and hybrid architectures cluster with masked autoencoders.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled typology showing that emergent computational strategies shaped jointly by architecture and training objective define representational structure beyond surface design categories, with convergence between architectural modernization and reconstruction-based training.

Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet
we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations
are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational
strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each
capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and
assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics
preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family
discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show
weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry
family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more
broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF
achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and
produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix
recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs
form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across
architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with
masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization
and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a
principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational
strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define

### [43] [FantasyWorld: Geometry-Consistent World Modeling via Unified Video and 3D Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21657)
*Yixiang Dai,Fan Jiang,Chiyu Wang,Mu Xu,Yonggang Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FantasyWorld is a geometry-enhanced framework that augments video foundation models with a trainable geometric branch to enable joint modeling of video latents and implicit 3D fields, improving spatial consistency and 3D reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding capabilities, limiting spatial consistency and utility for downstream 3D reasoning tasks despite having strong imaginative priors.

Method: Introduces a framework with cross-branch supervision where geometry cues guide video generation and video priors regularize 3D prediction, enabling joint modeling of video latents and implicit 3D fields in a single forward pass.

Result: Outperforms recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and style consistency, with geometric branch latents serving as versatile representations for downstream 3D tasks without per-scene optimization.

Conclusion: FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception through unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange, enabling consistent and generalizable 3D-aware video representations.

Abstract: High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR
content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong
imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding
capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility
for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a
geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a
trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an
implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces
cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video
priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable
3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the
geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for
downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without
requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show
that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception,
outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and
style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from
the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.

*Mahindra Singh Rautela,Alexander Most,Siddharth Mansingh,Bradley C. Love,Ayan Biswas,Diane Oyen,Earl Lawrence*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MORPH is a shape-agnostic autoregressive foundation model for PDEs that handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets across 1D-3D dimensions with mixed scalar/vector fields, using component-wise convolution, inter-field cross-attention, and axial attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a flexible foundation model that can handle the heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations across different data dimensionalities, resolutions, and field types in PDE modeling.

Method: Built on convolutional vision transformer with three key components: (1) component-wise convolution for joint processing of scalar/vector channels, (2) inter-field cross-attention for information propagation between fields, (3) axial attention to reduce computational burden while maintaining expressivity.

Result: MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot generalization, matching or surpassing strong baselines and state-of-the-art models across extensive evaluations using both full fine-tuning and LoRA adapters.

Conclusion: MORPH presents a flexible and powerful backbone for scientific machine learning, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient learning from heterogeneous scientific observations.

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for
partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision
transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal
datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions,
multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture
combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and
vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field
cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between
different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full
spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to
reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple
model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and
evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both
full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH
outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot
generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong
baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities
present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and
multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable
and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

*Jiali Zhang,Thomas S. White,Haoliang Zhang,Wenqing Hu,Donald C. Wunsch II,Jian Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-YOLO combines MobileNetV4 backbone with SlideLoss to improve infrared object detection, achieving competitive accuracy with 6.7 GFLOPs for edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in infrared object detection including class imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints for real-time urban applications.

Method: Replace YOLOv8's CSPDarknet with MobileNetV4 backbone and introduce SlideLoss function that dynamically emphasizes under-represented samples.

Result: Reduces computational overhead by 1.5%, achieves competitive mAP and superior precision with only 6.7 GFLOPs on FLIR ADAS V2 dataset.

Conclusion: MS-YOLO effectively balances detection quality and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time edge deployment in urban environments.

Abstract: Infrared imaging has emerged as a robust solution for urban object detection
under low-light and adverse weather conditions, offering significant advantages
over traditional visible-light cameras. However, challenges such as class
imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly
hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we
evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately
selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency.
Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4
and \textbf{S}lideLoss based on YOLO), which replaces YOLOv8's CSPDarknet
backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead
by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce
\emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes
under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing
recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only
\textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality
while minimizing computational costs, making it well-suited for real-time edge
deployment in urban environments.

### [46] [Motion-Aware Transformer for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21715)
*Xu Yang,Gady Agam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATR introduces motion-aware Transformer for multi-object tracking that explicitly predicts object movements to update track queries, reducing query conflicts and improving both detection and association accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DETR-based MOT frameworks process detection and tracking queries jointly in single Transformer layers, causing conflicts and degraded association accuracy in complex scenes with object motions.

Method: Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR) explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update track queries in advance, reducing query collisions and enabling more consistent training.

Result: MATR achieves state-of-the-art performance: 71.3 HOTA on DanceTrack (9+ point improvement), 72.2 HOTA on SportsMOT, and 54.7 mTETA/41.6 mHOTA on BDD100k without external datasets.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers provides a simple yet highly effective approach for advancing multi-object tracking performance.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex
object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer
end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries
jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and
degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer
(MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update
track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more
consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive
experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers
significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by
more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new
state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves
state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6
mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that
explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet
highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.

### [47] [DeLiVR: Differential Spatiotemporal Lie Bias for Efficient Video Deraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21719)
*Shuning Sun,Jialang Lu,Xiang Chen,Jichao Wang,Dianjie Lu,Guijuan Zhang,Guangwei Gao,Zhuoran Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLiVR is an efficient video deraining method that uses Lie-group differential biases in attention scores to address rain streaks, blur, and temporal artifacts in videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Videos captured in the wild suffer from rain streaks, blur, noise, and temporal artifacts from camera pose changes. Existing methods using optical flow or heuristic alignment are computationally expensive and less robust.

Method: Proposes DeLiVR with two components: 1) rotation-bounded Lie relative bias for geometry-consistent alignment using in-plane angle prediction, and 2) differential group displacement that computes angular differences between frames to estimate velocity with temporal decay and attention masks.

Result: Extensive experimental results demonstrate effectiveness on publicly available benchmarks.

Conclusion: Lie groups provide a principled way to enforce spatial and temporal consistency in video deraining, offering an efficient alternative to optical flow-based methods.

Abstract: Videos captured in the wild often suffer from rain streaks, blur, and noise.
In addition, even slight changes in camera pose can amplify cross-frame
mismatches and temporal artifacts. Existing methods rely on optical flow or
heuristic alignment, which are computationally expensive and less robust. To
address these challenges, Lie groups provide a principled way to represent
continuous geometric transformations, making them well-suited for enforcing
spatial and temporal consistency in video modeling. Building on this insight,
we propose DeLiVR, an efficient video deraining method that injects
spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases directly into attention scores of
the network. Specifically, the method introduces two complementary components.
First, a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias predicts the in-plane angle of each
frame using a compact prediction module, where normalized coordinates are
rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent
alignment before feature aggregation. Second, a differential group displacement
computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity.
This bias computation combines temporal decay and attention masks to focus on
inter-frame relationships while precisely matching the direction of rain
streaks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on publicly available benchmarks.

### [48] [On the Status of Foundation Models for SAR Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21722)
*Nathan Inkawhich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates foundational AI models for SAR object recognition, showing that self-supervised fine-tuning of existing models with SAR data significantly outperforms current SAR-domain models and sets new state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to apply the success of foundational AI models from natural images to SAR domain, leveraging their ability to adapt with limited labeled data, robustness to distribution shifts, and transferable features for SAR object recognition tasks.

Method: The method involves testing powerful visual foundational models (DINOv2, DINOv3, PE-Core) off-the-shelf, then performing self-supervised fine-tuning with SAR data to create AFRL-DINOv2 models, analyzing performance trade-offs with different backbones and downstream adaptation recipes.

Result: Self-supervised fine-tuning of SSL models with SAR data significantly outperforms current best SAR-domain model SARATR-X, setting new state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, with analysis of performance trade-offs across different operating conditions and data limitations.

Conclusion: While the work demonstrates viability and sets new benchmarks for SAR foundation models through self-supervised fine-tuning, there is still significant room for improvement and further development in this domain.

Abstract: In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the
tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the
natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale
datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these
models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how
we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted
downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms
of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable
out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this
technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with
today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and
PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting
discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that
Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a
viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new
state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's
best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance
trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream
task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome
challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating
conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and
inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive
results, we still have a long way to go.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UISim is an image-based UI simulator that predicts and synthesizes realistic mobile UI transitions from screen images, enabling scalable testing and AI agent training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UI testing methods rely on physical devices or static screenshots, which are not scalable for dynamic mobile environments and hinder AI agent development.

Method: Two-stage approach: first predicts abstract layout of next UI state from initial screen and user action, then synthesizes visually consistent image based on predicted layout.

Result: Outperforms end-to-end UI generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states, demonstrating high fidelity.

Conclusion: UISim provides practical benefits for UI testing, prototyping, and synthetic data generation, with potential for advanced applications like AI agent navigation planning.

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.

of vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in a real-world
clinical environment with limited computational resources. Although

### [51] [Incorporating Scene Context and Semantic Labels for Enhanced Group-level Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21747)
*Qing Zhu,Wangdong Guo,Qirong Mao,Xiaohua Huang,Xiuyan Shao,Wenming Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for group-level emotion recognition that incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to improve performance by aligning visual and semantic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling individual relationships and overlook the crucial role of semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of emotions.

Method: Proposes a framework with visual context encoding module using multi-scale scene information, emotion semantic encoding module using LLM-generated emotion lexicons refined through structured emotion tree, and similarity-aware interaction to align visual and semantic information.

Result: Experiments on three widely adopted GER datasets demonstrate competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves GER performance by incorporating both visual scene context and label-guided semantic information through proper alignment and integration.

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) aims to identify holistic emotions
within a scene involving multiple individuals. Current existed methods
underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling
individual relationships. Furthermore, they overlook the crucial role of
semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of
emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that
incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to
improve GER performance. It involves the visual context encoding module that
leverages multi-scale scene information to diversely encode individual
relationships. Complementarily, the emotion semantic encoding module utilizes
group-level emotion labels to prompt a large language model to generate nuanced
emotion lexicons. These lexicons, in conjunction with the emotion labels, are
then subsequently refined into comprehensive semantic representations through
the utilization of a structured emotion tree. Finally, similarity-aware
interaction is proposed to align and integrate visual and semantic information,
thereby generating enhanced group-level emotion representations and
subsequently improving the performance of GER. Experiments on three widely
adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: KG-SAM integrates medical knowledge graphs, CRF-based boundary refinement, and uncertainty estimation to enhance SAM for medical image segmentation, achieving significant performance improvements on prostate and abdominal datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of SAM to medical imaging faces challenges including ambiguous boundaries, lack of anatomical relationship modeling, and absence of uncertainty quantification, which are critical for clinical reliability.

Method: KG-SAM incorporates: (1) medical knowledge graph for anatomical relationships, (2) energy-based CRF for anatomically consistent predictions, (3) uncertainty-aware fusion module for clinical reliability.

Result: Achieved 82.69% Dice score on prostate segmentation, 78.05% on abdominal MRI, and 79.68% on abdominal CT across multi-center datasets, showing substantial gains over baseline approaches.

Conclusion: KG-SAM establishes a robust and generalizable framework that effectively bridges the gap between general-purpose segmentation models and medical imaging requirements through knowledge-guided integration.

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable success in
image segmentation, its direct application to medical imaging remains hindered
by fundamental challenges, including ambiguous boundaries, insufficient
modeling of anatomical relationships, and the absence of uncertainty
quantification. To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a
knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors
with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM
incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical
relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce
anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion
module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive
experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate
segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching
78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and
generalizable framework for advancing medical image segmentation.

### [53] [UniVid: Unifying Vision Tasks with Pre-trained Video Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21760)
*Lan Chen,Yuchao Gu,Qi Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVid is a framework that fine-tunes pre-trained video diffusion transformers to handle diverse vision tasks without task-specific modifications, using visual sentences to represent tasks and enabling cross-modal inference and cross-source generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more unified and scalable vision modeling approach that avoids costly task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, leveraging the inherent temporal sequence dependencies in pre-trained video generation models.

Method: Fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various vision tasks by representing tasks as visual sentences, where context sequences define both the task and expected output modality. Tasks can switch between understanding and generation by reversing visual sentence order.

Result: UniVid generalizes well in cross-modal inference (images and videos) and cross-source tasks (natural to annotated data) despite being trained only on natural video data, demonstrating the framework's scalability and unification capabilities.

Conclusion: Pre-trained video generation models have strong potential to serve as scalable and unified foundations for vision modeling, enabling flexible task adaptation without extensive multi-modal pre-training.

Abstract: Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify
diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by
this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision
by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts
serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires
task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and
limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation
models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more
unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model
adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a
framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various
vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as
visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the
expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two
perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images
and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks
from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite
being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both
settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by
simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings
highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a
scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released
at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UniVid.

*Wenyi Gong,Mieszko Lis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A token merging method that preserves spatial structure for compatibility with modern ViT architectures, achieving speedups with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern ViT backbones use spatial designs like window attention and relative positional embeddings, but existing token reduction methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these architectures depend on.

Method: Uses 2D reduction strategy for structured layouts, spatial-aware merging algorithm to maintain relative positions, and max-magnitude-per-dimension token representation to preserve salient features.

Result: Achieves 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop on COCO, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no accuracy drop on ImageNet after one fine-tuning epoch.

Conclusion: The method enables effective token reduction while maintaining spatial integrity, making it compatible with modern spatial architectures and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window
attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in
DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the
vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these
architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective
token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless
compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly
conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution
across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure
post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce
structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains
relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token
representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong
performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art
results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks.
Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop
evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1
accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

TL;DR: GASP-ICL is a training-free framework that enhances multimodal deepfake detection by using in-context learning with LVLMs, featuring adaptive scoring and propagation to select optimal demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs struggle with multimodal deepfake detection due to difficulties in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval.

Method: Proposes GASP-ICL framework with MDD-adapted feature extractor for aligned image-text pair retrieval and Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer (GSTAS) for cross-sample relation capture and query-aligned signal propagation.

Result: Experiments on four forgery types show GASP-ICL surpasses strong baselines and delivers performance gains without requiring LVLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: GASP-ICL effectively enhances multimodal deepfake detection capabilities of LVLMs through training-free in-context learning with adaptive demonstration selection.

Abstract: Multimodal deepfake detection (MDD) aims to uncover manipulations across
visual, textual, and auditory modalities, thereby reinforcing the reliability
of modern information systems. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal reasoning, their effectiveness in MDD is limited by
challenges in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal
inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval. To this end, we propose
Guided Adaptive Scorer and Propagation In-Context Learning (GASP-ICL), a
training-free framework for MDD. GASP-ICL employs a pipeline to preserve
semantic relevance while injecting task-aware knowledge into LVLMs. We leverage
an MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and build
a candidate set. We further design the Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer
(GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals,
producing discriminative exemplars. This enables precise selection of
semantically aligned, task-relevant demonstrations, enhancing LVLMs for robust
MDD. Experiments on four forgery types show that GASP-ICL surpasses strong
baselines, delivering gains without LVLM fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProDA is a novel framework for action recognition that disentangles specified actions from multi-action scenes using spatio-temporal scene graphs and dynamic prompts to generate action-specific representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods extract unified features for all actions in videos, making it challenging to model interactions between different objects in multi-action scenarios. The paper aims to address this by disentangling specified actions from complex scenes.

Method: ProDA uses Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs) and introduces a Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. It also features a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights.

Result: Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of ProDA when compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed ProDA framework effectively disentangles specified actions from multi-action scenes and shows superior performance in video action recognition tasks.

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing
methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video,
which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects
in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling
any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this
paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action
Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions
from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs)
and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural
Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we
design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights.
Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found

Abstract: The rise in harmful online content not only distorts public discourse but
also poses significant challenges to maintaining a healthy digital environment.
In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for
identifying hate in digital content. Central to our methodology is the
innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion
techniques combined with the Digital Attention Analysis Module (DAAM). This
combination is instrumental in pinpointing the hateful elements within images,
thereby generating detailed hate attention maps, which are used to blur these
regions from the image, thereby removing the hateful sections of the image. We
release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also
describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a
vision-language model designed for multimodal dehatification tasks. Our
approach sets a new standard in AI-driven image hate detection given textual
prompts, contributing to the development of more ethical AI applications in
social media.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs lack cross-image reasoning capabilities and sufficient cross-image reference reward modeling, limiting their ability to understand complex relationships across multiple images.

Method: Two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning with annotated trajectories + image-aware RL optimization. Innovative trajectory data construction integrating object-level and image-level annotations. Dual reward functions for objects and images in RL policy.

Conclusion: MIRG-RL effectively addresses cross-image reasoning challenges and demonstrates superior performance through its unified framework and innovative training approach.

Abstract: Multi-image reasoning and grounding require understanding complex cross-image
relationships at both object levels and image levels. Current Large Visual
Language Models (LVLMs) face two critical challenges: the lack of cross-image
reasoning capabilities and insufficient cross-image reference reward modeling.
To address these issues, we propose a unified framework - Multi-Image Reasoning
and Grounding with Reinforcement Learning (MIRG-RL). Specifically, our
two-stage training paradigm combines supervised fine-tuning with annotated
trajectories and image-aware reinforcement learning optimization, progressively
developing multi-image reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively
propose a method for constructing the trajectory data, which integrates
object-level and image-level annotation information, and use this method to
generate a lightweight reasoning-enhanced dataset. To effectively resolve
cross-image ambiguities, we design an image-aware RL policy with dual reward
functions for objects and images. Experiments demonstrate that MIRG-RL achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-image grounding benchmarks,
attaining 64.82% on cross-image reasoning tasks - exceeding the previous best
method by 1%. The code and dataset have been released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongScape is a hybrid video generation framework that combines diffusion denoising with autoregressive generation using action-guided chunking and Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts to achieve stable long-horizon video generation for embodied manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation methods struggle with stable long-horizon generation - diffusion-based approaches suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual drift, while autoregressive methods compromise visual detail.

Method: Hybrid framework combining intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk autoregressive causal generation, featuring action-guided variable-length chunking and Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) that adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate stable and consistent long-horizon generation over extended rollouts, achieving high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions.

Conclusion: LongScape successfully addresses the challenges of long-horizon video generation for embodied manipulation by combining the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods through intelligent chunking and adaptive expert selection.

Abstract: Video-based world models hold significant potential for generating
high-quality embodied manipulation data. However, current video generation
methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical
diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual
drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise
on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework
that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk
autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided,
variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic
context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete,
coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We
further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that
adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation,
guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent
long-horizon generation over extended rollouts. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: MoWM is a mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses motion-aware latent representations with fine-grained pixel features for embodied action planning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CALVIN benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation world models suffer from visual redundancies that hinder action decoding, while latent world models overlook fine-grained details needed for precise manipulation.

Method: Proposes MoWM framework that uses motion-aware latent representations as high-level prior to guide extraction of fine-grained visual features from pixel space model, highlighting informative details for action decoding.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior generalization on CALVIN benchmark, with comprehensive analysis of feature space strengths.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively combines the strengths of both latent and pixel-space world models for improved embodied action planning performance.

Abstract: Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to
generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions.
While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on
pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder
action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact,
motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for
precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a
mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world
models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware
representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the
extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This
design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for
action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior
generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of
each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied
planning. The code is available at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoWM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiTraj is a training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video generation using Diffusion Transformers (DiT), featuring foreground-background separation guidance and inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE to enhance trajectory control without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory control methods either require substantial training resources or are designed for U-Net architectures, failing to leverage the superior performance of DiT models in video generation.

Method: Proposes foreground-background separation using LLM to guide foreground and background regions separately, and introduces STD-RoPE that modifies foreground tokens' position embedding to eliminate cross-frame spatial discrepancies and strengthen cross-frame attention for better trajectory control.

Result: Extensive experiments show DiTraj outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory controllability.

Conclusion: DiTraj provides an effective training-free solution for trajectory control in DiT-based video generation, achieving superior performance through innovative position embedding modifications and foreground-background guidance.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full
attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents
a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However,
existing methods either require substantial training resources or are
specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior
performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but
effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video
generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's
trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the
Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and
background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and
background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore
the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position
embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled
3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding,
STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening
cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control.
Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density
of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory
controllability.

Motivation: Multi-hop reasoning requiring evidence combination across multiple passages remains challenging for Transformer-based models in question answering.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of retrieval strategies including cosine similarity, maximal marginal relevance, and hybrid method integrating dense embeddings with lexical overlap and re-ranking. Adapted EfficientRAG pipeline with token labeling and iterative refinement.

Result: Hybrid approach substantially outperforms baseline methods with 50% relative improvement in exact match and 47% in F1 score compared to cosine similarity. Improves entity recall and evidence complementarity.

Conclusion: Hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides practical zero-shot solution for multi-hop question answering, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced the field of question answering, but
multi-hop reasoning, where answers require combining evidence across multiple
passages, remains difficult. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of
retrieval strategies for multi-hop question answering within a
retrieval-augmented generation framework. We compare cosine similarity, maximal
marginal relevance, and a hybrid method that integrates dense embeddings with
lexical overlap and re-ranking. To further improve retrieval, we adapt the
EfficientRAG pipeline for query optimization, introducing token labeling and
iterative refinement while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on the HotpotQA
dataset show that the hybrid approach substantially outperforms baseline
methods, achieving a relative improvement of 50 percent in exact match and 47
percent in F1 score compared to cosine similarity. Error analysis reveals that
hybrid retrieval improves entity recall and evidence complementarity, while
remaining limited in handling distractors and temporal reasoning. Overall, the
results suggest that hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides a practical
zero-shot solution for multi-hop question answering, balancing accuracy,
efficiency, and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HDR-4DGS, a method for HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis that handles dynamic scenes with temporal radiance variations using Gaussian Splatting and dynamic tone-mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HDR NVS methods focus on static scenes, but real-world scenarios often contain dynamic elements like moving objects and varying lighting, creating a more challenging problem that needs joint modeling of temporal radiance variations and 3D translation between LDR and HDR domains.

Method: Proposed HDR-4DGS uses Gaussian Splatting architecture with a dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by adapting tone-mapping functions according to evolving radiance distributions across time.

Result: HDR-4DGS achieves temporal radiance consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed HDR-4DGS successfully addresses the challenging problem of HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis for dynamic scenes, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods through its innovative dynamic tone-mapping approach.

Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D
model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional
imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes,
implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living.
However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as
moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby
presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we
propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR
DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of
jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D
translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge,
we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an
innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR
domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting
tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across
the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance
consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic
HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will
be released.

*Minje Kim,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRHand is a method that reconstructs detailed 3D hand geometry and textured images from low-resolution inputs by combining implicit image representation with explicit hand meshes, achieving superior performance over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for hand reconstruction rely on high-resolution multi-view images and fail on low-resolution inputs. Multi-view super-resolution methods work only for static scenes, not articulated hands.

Method: Proposes SRHand with geometric-aware implicit image function (GIIF) that learns hand priors to upsample coarse images. Jointly optimizes implicit image function and explicit 3D hand shapes to maintain multi-view and pose consistency.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling and 3D hand reconstruction methods on InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, achieving fine-detailed reconstruction of wrinkles and nails.

Conclusion: SRHand successfully bridges the gap between low-resolution input and high-fidelity 3D hand reconstruction by leveraging implicit-explicit representation fusion, enabling detailed geometry recovery from limited image data.

Abstract: Reconstructing detailed hand avatars plays a crucial role in various
applications. While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand
geometry, they heavily rely on high-resolution multi-view image inputs and
struggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image
super-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency.
These methods, however, are limited to static objects/scenes with fixed
resolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this
paper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing
detailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution
images. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with
explicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit
image function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse
input images. By jointly optimizing the implicit image function and explicit 3D
hand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among
upsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles,
nails). In experiments using the InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to
hand datasets, and 3D hand reconstruction methods, quantitatively and
qualitatively. Project page: https://yunminjin2.github.io/projects/srhand

*Janis Keuper,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper argues that current fake image detection research focuses too much on generative algorithms while neglecting proper definition and data collection of "real" images, suggesting we need to rethink what constitutes a "real" image in the modern smartphone era.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread availability of image generation models has raised concerns about criminal misuse, but current detection methods rely on outdated definitions and datasets of "real" images that don't reflect modern smartphone photography which uses neural network-based image processing.

Method: This is a position paper that analyzes current limitations in fake image detection research, highlighting how modern smartphone photography uses neural network algorithms similar to fake image generators, making the distinction between "real" and "fake" increasingly blurred.

Result: The analysis reveals that current fake detection methods rely on outdated low-resolution datasets like ImageNet, while modern smartphone photography (90% of photos) uses neural network-based image formation algorithms that closely resemble fake image generators.

Conclusion: The detection of "fake" images may not be a sound objective without clear technical definitions of "real" images and new benchmark datasets that account for modern image acquisition technologies.

Abstract: The wide availability and low usability barrier of modern image generation
models has triggered the reasonable fear of criminal misconduct and negative
social implications. The machine learning community has been engaging this
problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic
solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially
manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical
solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too
much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear
definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what
is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis
shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current
"fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution
datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the
acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over
the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones
which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over
time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation
algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related
to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to
re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to
raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of
research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake"
images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear
technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: Aes-R1 is a reinforcement learning framework that enhances multimodal LLMs for image aesthetic assessment by generating interpretable rationales and improving scoring accuracy through structured reasoning and joint optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs struggle with aesthetic assessment due to scarce multimodal aesthetic reasoning data and the subjective nature of aesthetic judgments, making it difficult to generate accurate scores with interpretable explanations.

Method: Proposes Aes-R1 framework with AesCoT pipeline for constructing high-quality chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data, and RAPO algorithm that jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order through reinforcement learning.

Result: Aes-R1 improves backbone's average PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar size, with robust generalization under limited supervision and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: Aes-R1 enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores, enhancing both aesthetic scoring and reasoning capabilities in a unified framework.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic
assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their
cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal
aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic
judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments
with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive
aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely,
Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality
chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching
the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ
the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that
jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order,
improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1
enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores,
thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average
PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar
size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under
limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

TL;DR: StableDub is a visual dubbing framework that improves lip synchronization by modeling speaker-specific lip habits and handling occlusions robustly using a diffusion-based approach with occlusion-aware training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual dubbing methods have two main limitations: audio-only driving fails to capture speaker-specific lip habits, and conventional inpainting methods produce artifacts when handling obstructions like microphones or hands.

Method: Built on Stable-Diffusion backbone with lip-habit-modulated mechanism for phonemic audio-visual synchronization and speaker-specific dynamics. Uses occlusion-aware training by exposing occlusion objects during inpainting. Employs hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture for efficiency.

Result: Superior performance in lip habit resemblance, occlusion robustness, audio-lip sync, video quality, and resolution consistency. Achieves better training efficiency without cost-intensive priors.

Conclusion: StableDub expands visual dubbing applicability by addressing key limitations in lip habit modeling and occlusion handling, demonstrating superior performance across multiple metrics.

Abstract: The visual dubbing task aims to generate mouth movements synchronized with
the driving audio, which has seen significant progress in recent years.
However, two critical deficiencies hinder their wide application: (1)
Audio-only driving paradigms inadequately capture speaker-specific lip habits,
which fail to generate lip movements similar to the target avatar; (2)
Conventional blind-inpainting approaches frequently produce visual artifacts
when handling obstructions (e.g., microphones, hands), limiting practical
deployment. In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework
integrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis.
Specifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a
lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual
synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible
lip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the
occlusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects
to the inpainting process. By incorporating the proposed designs, the model
eliminates the necessity for cost-intensive priors in previous methods, thereby
exhibiting superior training efficiency on the computationally intensive
diffusion-based backbone. To further optimize training efficiency from the
perspective of model architecture, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, which demonstrates the enhanced applicability in low-resource
research scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that StableDub
achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion
robustness. Our method also surpasses other methods in audio-lip sync, video
quality, and resolution consistency. We expand the applicability of visual
dubbing methods from comprehensive aspects, and demo videos can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable interactive control over object motion within text-driven 3D scene generation, allowing users to define 3D trajectories for objects and seamlessly integrate them into generated 3D environments.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Enhanced text-to-3D background generation using 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and inpainted novel views; 2) 3D copy-and-paste approach using off-the-shelf image-to-3D model for object extraction and physics-aware object position learning for spatial alignment; 3) Temporal animation with part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model for view-consistent motion.

Result: The framework achieves harmonized alignment of user-controlled object motion within high-quality 3D backgrounds, demonstrating effectiveness through evaluations at each stage and in final results.

Conclusion: Drag4D provides a unified architecture for interactive 3D scene generation with object motion control, successfully integrating spatial alignment and temporal animation while mitigating motion hallucination and ensuring view consistency.

Abstract: We introduce Drag4D, an interactive framework that integrates object motion
control within text-driven 3D scene generation. This framework enables users to
define 3D trajectories for the 3D objects generated from a single image,
seamlessly integrating them into a high-quality 3D background. Our Drag4D
pipeline consists of three stages. First, we enhance text-to-3D background
generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and
inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D
reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target
object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is
extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and
seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then
positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning,
ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is
temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion
hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a
part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes
multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations
at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of
user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Syncphony is an audio-to-video generation model that creates 380x640 resolution, 24fps videos synchronized with audio inputs using motion-aware loss and audio sync guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-to-video models struggle with fine-grained synchronization due to indirect conditioning or limited temporal modeling, while audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion.

Method: Builds on pre-trained video backbone with two key components: Motion-aware Loss (emphasizes high-motion regions) and Audio Sync Guidance (uses visually aligned off-sync model to guide full model at inference).

Result: Outperforms existing methods on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets in both synchronization accuracy and visual quality, with proposed CycleSync metric showing improved motion-audio alignment.

Conclusion: Syncphony effectively addresses temporal synchronization challenges in audio-to-video generation through specialized loss functions and guidance mechanisms, achieving superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation have made rapid progress in
visual quality, but they remain limited in controlling the precise timing of
motion. In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion,
making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation.
However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained
synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal
modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution,
24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve
synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at
high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using
a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio

synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that
measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the
original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets

*Yixiao Liu,Yizhou Yang,Jinwen Li,Jun Tao,Ruoyu Li,Xiangkun Wang,Min Zhu,Junlong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LG-CD is a novel language-guided change detection model that uses text prompts to direct attention to regions of interest, improving accuracy and robustness in remote sensing change detection by integrating visual and textual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most deep learning-based RSCD methods focus only on unimodal visual information and neglect the rich semantic information from multimodal data like text, limiting their performance and robustness.

Method: Uses SAM2 visual foundation model for multi-scale feature extraction, multi-layer adapters for fine-tuning, Text Fusion Attention Module for visual-text alignment, and Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder with cross-attention to integrate visual and semantic information.

Result: LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, SYSU-CD) and provides new insights for generalized change detection using multimodal information.

Conclusion: The proposed LG-CD model effectively leverages multimodal information through language guidance to achieve superior change detection performance and opens new possibilities for generalized change detection approaches.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Change Detection (RSCD) typically identifies changes in land
cover or surface conditions by analyzing multi-temporal images. Currently, most
deep learning-based methods primarily focus on learning unimodal visual
information, while neglecting the rich semantic information provided by
multimodal data such as text. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
Language-Guided Change Detection model (LG-CD). This model leverages natural
language prompts to direct the network's attention to regions of interest,
significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of change detection.
Specifically, LG-CD utilizes a visual foundational model (SAM2) as a feature
extractor to capture multi-scale pyramid features from high-resolution to
low-resolution across bi-temporal remote sensing images. Subsequently,
multi-layer adapters are employed to fine-tune the model for downstream tasks,
ensuring its effectiveness in remote sensing change detection. Additionally, we
design a Text Fusion Attention Module (TFAM) to align visual and textual
information, enabling the model to focus on target change regions using text
prompts. Finally, a Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder (V-SFD) is implemented,
which deeply integrates visual and semantic information through a
cross-attention mechanism to produce highly accurate change detection masks.
Our experiments on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate
that LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods.
Furthermore, our approach provides new insights into achieving generalized
change detection by leveraging multimodal information.

*Qihang Wang,Yaxiong Wang,Lechao Cheng,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing that combines precise spatial control from drag interactions with texture manipulation from text guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-driven methods lack precise spatial control while drag-driven approaches lack fine-grained texture guidance. The paper aims to integrate both paradigms to overcome their complementary limitations.

Method: Proposes Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag for enhanced latent-space layout control through 3D feature mapping, and Drag-Text Guided Denoising that dynamically balances drag and text conditions during denoising.

Result: The method achieves high-fidelity joint editing and matches or surpasses specialized text-only or drag-only approaches. It supports flexible editing modes (text-only, drag-only, or combined) while maintaining strong performance in each setting.

Conclusion: Establishes a versatile and generalizable solution for controllable image manipulation that integrates the strengths of both text-driven and drag-driven editing paradigms.

Abstract: This paper explores image editing under the joint control of text and drag
interactions. While recent advances in text-driven and drag-driven editing have
achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from complementary limitations:
text-driven methods excel in texture manipulation but lack precise spatial
control, whereas drag-driven approaches primarily modify shape and structure
without fine-grained texture guidance. To address these limitations, we propose
a unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing,
integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which enhances latent-space
layout control through 3D feature mapping, and (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising,
dynamically balancing the influence of drag and text conditions during
denoising. Notably, our model supports flexible editing modes - operating with
text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions - while maintaining strong
performance in each setting. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method not only achieves high-fidelity joint editing but
also matches or surpasses the performance of specialized text-only or drag-only
approaches, establishing a versatile and generalizable solution for
controllable image manipulation. Code will be made publicly available to
reproduce all results presented in this work.

TL;DR: Proposes a sideload-CL-adaptation framework that uses unannotated UAV data to improve vehicle detection in Nordic regions with snow coverage challenges, achieving 3.8-9.5% mAP50 improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vehicle detection from UAV images in Nordic regions faces visibility challenges and domain shifts from diverse snow coverage. Annotated data is expensive but unannotated data is cheap to obtain.

Method: Train CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive learning on unannotated data, then sideload it to frozen YOLO11n backbone during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments compare fusion methods and granularity.

Result: Proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model improves detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD dataset.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages unannotated data to enhance vehicle detection performance in challenging Nordic conditions with snow coverage.

Abstract: Aside from common challenges in remote sensing like small, sparse targets and
computation cost limitations, detecting vehicles from UAV images in the Nordic
regions faces strong visibility challenges and domain shifts caused by diverse
levels of snow coverage. Although annotated data are expensive, unannotated
data is cheaper to obtain by simply flying the drones. In this work, we
proposed a sideload-CL-adaptation framework that enables the use of unannotated
data to improve vehicle detection using lightweight models. Specifically, we
propose to train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive
learning on the unannotated data in the pretraining stage, and then sideload it
to a frozen YOLO11n backbone in the fine-tuning stage. To find a robust
sideload-CL-adaptation, we conducted extensive experiments to compare various
fusion methods and granularity. Our proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model
improves the detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD
dataset.

TL;DR: IF-V2V is an inversion-free video editing method that adapts flow-matching-based image-to-video models for video editing without significant computational overhead, achieving superior editing quality and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing methods require inversion with model-specific design or extensive optimization, limiting their ability to leverage up-to-date image-to-video models for transferring image editing capabilities to videos.

Method: Uses Vector Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate source video information into denoising, Structure-and-Motion-Preserving Initialization for motion-aware noise generation, and Deviation Caching to minimize computational costs.

Result: Achieves superior editing quality and consistency over existing approaches while offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution.

Conclusion: IF-V2V provides an effective inversion-free method for video editing that can adapt existing I2V models without significant computational overhead, enabling better transfer of image editing capabilities to video domain.

Abstract: Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing,
which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging
challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require
inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting
their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to
transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To
this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt
off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without
significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector
Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the
source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into
the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video
in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving
Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with
structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism
to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector
rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency
over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to
realize visual creativity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSLCounter is a self-supervised learning framework for multi-view counting that uses neural volumetric rendering to reduce reliance on annotated data, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 70% of training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most multi-view counting methods require large annotated datasets through fully supervised learning, which is data-intensive and limits practical applications.

Method: Uses neural volumetric rendering to learn implicit scene representations, enabling reconstruction of continuous geometry and view-dependent appearance through differential neural rendering.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and delivers competitive results using only 70% of training data across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: SSLCounter provides a data-efficient solution for multi-view counting that can be seamlessly integrated into existing frameworks while reducing annotation requirements.

Abstract: Multi-view counting (MVC) methods have attracted significant research
attention and stimulated remarkable progress in recent years. Despite their
success, most MVC methods have focused on improving performance by following
the fully supervised learning (FSL) paradigm, which often requires large
amounts of annotated data. In this work, we propose SSLCounter, a novel
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for MVC that leverages neural
volumetric rendering to alleviate the reliance on large-scale annotated
datasets. SSLCounter learns an implicit representation w.r.t. the scene,
enabling the reconstruction of continuous geometry shape and the complex,
view-dependent appearance of their 2D projections via differential neural
rendering. Owing to its inherent flexibility, the key idea of our method can be
seamlessly integrated into exsiting frameworks. Notably, extensive experiments
demonstrate that SSLCounter not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performances
but also delivers competitive performance with only using 70% proportion of
training data, showcasing its superior data efficiency across multiple MVC
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A benchmark for evaluating object-centric spatial reasoning in vision foundation models reveals a trade-off between precise localization in detectors and relational reasoning in vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks focus on localization accuracy but neglect whether models truly understand how objects are arranged and related within scenes, which is crucial for effective scene understanding.

Method: Used a controlled synthetic dataset to evaluate state-of-the-art vision models and VLMs across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and downstream retrieval tasks.

Result: Detectors like GroundingDINO and OWLv2 provide precise bounding boxes but limited relational reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o offer coarse layout cues and fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context.

Conclusion: There's a significant gap between localization and true spatial understanding, highlighting the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the community.

Abstract: Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models.
While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs)
have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization
accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and
related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene
understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their
relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a
systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models.
Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision
models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL,
LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and
downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as
GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational
reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and
fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study
highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and
pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the
community.

TL;DR: PANICL is a training-free framework that improves visual in-context learning by using multiple in-context pairs to reduce bias and instability caused by over-reliance on single examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual In-Context Learning often suffers from over-reliance on single in-context pairs, leading to biased and unstable predictions.

Method: Patch-based k-Nearest neighbor approach that smooths assignment scores across multiple in-context pairs without requiring additional training.

Result: Consistent improvements across various vision tasks including segmentation, detection, colorization, and keypoint detection. Shows strong robustness to domain shifts and generalizes well to other VICL models.

Conclusion: PANICL is a versatile and broadly applicable framework that effectively mitigates bias in visual in-context learning through multi-patch aggregation.

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to
as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide
models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from
over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and
unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual
In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates
this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment
scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training.
Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation,
single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint
detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover,
PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level
shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and
generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM,
highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SingRef6D is a lightweight 6D pose estimation pipeline that uses only a single RGB reference image, eliminating the need for depth sensors, multi-view images, or complex training models. It achieves robust performance in challenging conditions through improved depth prediction and depth-aware matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation methods have practical limitations: depth-based methods fail with transparent/reflective surfaces, while RGB-based methods struggle in low-light and texture-less scenes due to lack of geometry information.

Method: Two key innovations: 1) Token-scaler-based fine-tuning mechanism with novel optimization loss on Depth-Anything v2 for accurate depth prediction on challenging surfaces; 2) Depth-aware matching process that integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR for handling challenging materials and lighting conditions.

Result: 14.41% improvement in depth prediction on REAL275 compared to Depth-Anything v2; achieves 6.1% improvement in average recall for pose estimation on REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SingRef6D provides a robust and capable solution for 6D pose estimation in resource-limited settings where depth or dense templates are unavailable, effectively handling challenging surface conditions and lighting scenarios.

Abstract: Recent 6D pose estimation methods demonstrate notable performance but still
face some practical limitations. For instance, many of them rely heavily on
sensor depth, which may fail with challenging surface conditions, such as
transparent or highly reflective materials. In the meantime, RGB-based
solutions provide less robust matching performance in low-light and
texture-less scenes due to the lack of geometry information. Motivated by
these, we propose SingRef6D, a lightweight pipeline requiring only a single RGB
image as a reference, eliminating the need for costly depth sensors, multi-view
image acquisition, or training view synthesis models and neural fields. This
enables SingRef6D to remain robust and capable even under resource-limited
settings where depth or dense templates are unavailable. Our framework
incorporates two key innovations. First, we propose a token-scaler-based
fine-tuning mechanism with a novel optimization loss on top of Depth-Anything
v2 to enhance its ability to predict accurate depth, even for challenging
surfaces. Our results show a 14.41% improvement (in $\delta_{1.05}$) on REAL275
depth prediction compared to Depth-Anything v2 (with fine-tuned head). Second,
benefiting from depth availability, we introduce a depth-aware matching process
that effectively integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR, enabling our
system to handle matching for challenging materials and lighting conditions.
Evaluations of pose estimation on the REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a
6.1% improvement in average recall.

Motivation: Existing foundation models for visual navigation suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: Proposes DynaNav with trainable hard feature selector for sparse operations and integrates feature selection with early-exit mechanism using Bayesian Optimization to determine optimal exit thresholds.

Result: Achieves 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time, and 32.8% lower memory usage compared to ViNT, while improving navigation performance across four public datasets.

Conclusion: DynaNav effectively addresses computational efficiency and interpretability challenges in visual navigation, making it suitable for resource-tight deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However,
existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders,
suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting
their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose
DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer
selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature
selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability.
Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with
Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce
computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and
simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to
ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time,

*Woosung Joung,Daewon Chae,Jinkyu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemanticControl is a training-free method that enables text-to-image diffusion models to effectively use misaligned visual conditions by adaptively suppressing conflicting visual guidance and strengthening text guidance using attention masks extracted from surrogate prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNet's effectiveness depends on precisely aligned visual conditions, which are often unavailable for uncommon or imaginative scenes. Loosely aligned conditions (like human poses for animal scenes) cause low text fidelity or artifacts in existing methods.

Method: Run auxiliary denoising with a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition to extract attention masks, then use these masks during actual target prompt denoising to suppress conflicting visual guidance and strengthen text guidance.

Result: Experimental results show improved performance under loosely aligned conditions across various condition types (depth maps, edge maps, human skeletons), outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: SemanticControl effectively addresses the limitation of requiring precisely aligned visual conditions in ControlNet, enabling better use of misaligned but semantically relevant visual guides without additional training.

Abstract: ControlNet has enabled detailed spatial control in text-to-image diffusion
models by incorporating additional visual conditions such as depth or edge
maps. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual
conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by
text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon
or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a
specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.
In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common
settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can
serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models
struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low
text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose
SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned
but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses
the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while
strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary
denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition
(e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract
informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising
of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned
conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and
human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new Emotion Statement Judgment task and automated pipeline to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models' (MLLMs) emotion perception capabilities, revealing their strengths in emotion interpretation but limitations in understanding perception subjectivity compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for MLLMs' emotion perception have constraints including oversight of plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual factors, and labor-intensive annotations, leading to inconsistent results in zero-shot scenarios.

Method: Proposed an Emotion Statement Judgment task and developed an automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with minimal human effort to systematically evaluate MLLMs' emotion perception capabilities.

Result: MLLMs show stronger performance in emotion interpretation and context-based emotion judgment, but have relative limitations in comprehending perception subjectivity. Even top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate significant performance gaps compared to humans.

Conclusion: The study provides a fundamental evaluation framework for advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs, highlighting key areas for future improvement in emotion perception capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional
performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations
regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving
emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results
in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from
constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of
plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual
factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual
emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task
that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an
automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with
minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our
study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and
context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in
comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even
top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps,
underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental
evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope
this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project

TL;DR: MultiCrafter is a framework for multi-subject image generation that addresses attribute leakage and human preference alignment through positional supervision, Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and online reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-subject image generation methods suffer from severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and fail to align with nuanced human preferences due to reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives.

Method: The framework introduces explicit positional supervision to separate attention regions, employs Mixture-of-Experts architecture for scenario-specific planning, and uses online reinforcement learning with a specialized scoring mechanism for preference alignment.

Result: Experiments show that MultiCrafter significantly improves subject fidelity while better aligning with human preferences compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses key limitations in multi-subject image generation by mitigating attribute leakage through attention separation and enhancing preference alignment through reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize user-provided subjects in a
single image while preserving subject fidelity, ensuring prompt consistency,
and aligning with human aesthetic preferences. However, existing methods,
particularly those built on the In-Context-Learning paradigm, are limited by
their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both
severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align
with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a
framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we
find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of
attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore,
we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention
regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable
the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in
diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the
model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios.
Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the
model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately
assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for
the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly
improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.

TL;DR: PartSAM is the first promptable 3D part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data, outperforming existing methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing open-world part segmentation methods that rely on 2D foundation models and fail to capture intrinsic 3D geometry, leading to surface-only understanding and limited generalization.

Method: PartSAM uses an encoder-decoder architecture with triplane-based dual-branch encoder for scalable part-aware representation learning, trained on over 5 million 3D shape-part pairs curated through a model-in-the-loop annotation pipeline.

Result: PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification with single prompts and automatically decomposes shapes into both surface and internal structures in Segment-Every-Part mode, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by large margins.

Conclusion: PartSAM represents a decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding, demonstrating emergent open-world capabilities through scalable architecture and diverse 3D data.

Abstract: Segmenting 3D objects into parts is a long-standing challenge in computer
vision. To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects,
recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically
transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting
multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture
intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled
decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first
promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data.
Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder
architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially
structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable
large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation
pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets,
providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable
architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with
a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a
Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface
and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a
decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding. Our code and
model will be released soon.

Result: EfficientNet B0 achieved state-of-the-art performance with PLCC=0.9286 and SRCC=0.9178 on CCID2014, and PLCC=0.9581 and SRCC=0.9369 on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and other deep baselines. The Siamese network showed limited ability to capture perceptual contrast distortions.

Conclusion: Contrast-aware adaptation of lightweight pre-trained networks provides a high-performing, scalable solution for no-reference contrast quality assessment suitable for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Image contrast was a fundamental factor in visual perception and played a
vital role in overall image quality. However, most no reference image quality
assessment NR IQA models struggled to accurately evaluate contrast distortions
under diverse real world conditions. In this study, we proposed a deep learning
based framework for blind contrast quality assessment by customizing and
fine-tuning three pre trained architectures, EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2, for perceptual Mean Opinion Score, along with an additional model
built on a Siamese network, which indicated a limited ability to capture
perceptual contrast distortions. Each model is modified with a contrast-aware
regression head and trained end to end using targeted data augmentations on two
benchmark datasets, CID2013 and CCID2014, containing synthetic and authentic
contrast distortions. Performance is evaluated using Pearson Linear Correlation
Coefficient and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, which assess the
alignment between predicted and human rated scores. Among these three models,
our customized EfficientNet B0 model achieved state-of-the-art performance with
PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369
on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and outperforming other deep
baselines. These results highlighted the models robustness and effectiveness in
capturing perceptual contrast distortion. Overall, the proposed method
demonstrated that contrast aware adaptation of lightweight pre trained networks
can yield a high performing, scalable solution for no reference contrast
quality assessment suitable for real time and resource constrained
applications.

*Zilun Zhang,Zian Guan,Tiancheng Zhao,Haozhan Shen,Tianyu Li,Yuxiang Cai,Zhonggen Su,Zhaojun Liu,Jianwei Yin,Xiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-R1 introduces a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm for few-shot geospatial referring that generates explicit reasoning chains before localization, improving performance and interpretability in data-scarce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning struggles with poor generalization in data-scarce scenarios for remote sensing referring expression understanding, which requires complex object-context reasoning.

Method: Proposes Geo-R1 with a 'reason first, then act' process: first generate explicit interpretable reasoning chains to decompose referring expressions, then use these rationales to localize target objects through reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: Consistently and substantially outperforms SFT baselines on three few-shot geospatial referring benchmarks, demonstrating strong cross-dataset generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: The reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm enables more effective use of limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability for geospatial referring tasks.

Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges,
as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves
strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce
scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we
propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm
for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate
explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions,
and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason
first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of
limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We
validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring
benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT
baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at

*Zikun Guo,Xinyue Xu,Pei Xiang,Shu Yang,Xin Han,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating clinical sycophancy in medical VLMs, proposes a mitigation strategy called VIPER that filters non-evidentiary content, and demonstrates its effectiveness in reducing sycophantic behavior while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in clinical workflows but often exhibit sycophantic behavior that prioritizes alignment with user phrasing and social cues over evidence-based reasoning, which poses risks in medical decision-making.

Method: Created a medical sycophancy dataset from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD, stratified by organ system and modality. Used psychologically motivated pressure templates to test various VLMs, and proposed VIPER - a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non-evidentiary content and generates evidence-first answers.

Result: VLMs were found generally vulnerable to sycophancy, with significant variations in adversarial responses that weakly correlated with model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert-provided corrections were the most effective triggers, indicating bias mechanisms independent of visual evidence. VIPER framework reduced sycophancy by an average amount while outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The benchmark and VIPER mitigation framework provide groundwork for robust deployment of medical VLMs in real-world clinician interactions, emphasizing the need for evidence-anchored defenses against sycophantic behavior.

Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical
workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment
with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based
reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question
answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical
sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by
different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated
pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments
on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable,
exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses,
with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert
provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting
that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To
address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based
Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary
content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence
first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount
outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark
analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of
medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLARIFY is a novel method that leverages spatiotemporal gaze information to enhance Vision-Language Models' effectiveness in handling ambiguous queries from smart glasses users, addressing noisy gaze patterns and complex spatiotemporal relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With smart glasses gaining popularity, integrating users' attention into VLMs is crucial for daily multi-modal querying. However, gaze data introduces ambiguity challenges: ambiguous verbal questions (using pronouns/skipping context) and noisy gaze patterns with complex spatiotemporal relationships. Previous works using single images fail to capture dynamic attention.

Method: 1) Analyzed gaze modality samples to demonstrate noisy gaze patterns; 2) Used GPT-4o to create automatic data synthesis pipeline generating GLARIFY-Ambi dataset with chain-of-thought process for handling noisy gaze; 3) Designed heatmap module to incorporate gaze information into VLMs while preserving pretrained knowledge.

Result: GLARIFY was evaluated using a hold-out test set and significantly outperformed baseline methods in experiments.

Conclusion: By robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable and intuitive interaction paradigm with visual assistants, addressing the challenges of gaze ambiguity in real-world applications.

Abstract: With the rise in popularity of smart glasses, users' attention has been
integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal
querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users'
attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions
become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze
patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with
their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual
modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention.
In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal
gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world
applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze
modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then
utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the
GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process
to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to
incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their
pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set.
Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By
robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable
and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.

### [87] [From Bias to Balance: Exploring and Mitigating Spatial Bias in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21984)
*Yingjie Zhu,Xuefeng Bai,Kehai Chen,Yang Xiang,Weili Guan,Jun Yu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLMs exhibit spatial bias where identical visual information placed at different image positions produces inconsistent outputs, due to unbalanced position embeddings in the language model. BaPA assigns identical position embeddings to all image tokens to mitigate this bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study and address the spatial robustness limitations of Large Vision-Language Models, which show inconsistent outputs when key visual information is placed at different image locations.

Method: Proposed Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA) - a mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image tokens to promote balanced integration of visual information across spatial positions.

Result: BaPA enhances spatial robustness without retraining and boosts performance across multimodal benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Analysis shows it yields balanced attention for more holistic visual understanding.

Conclusion: Spatial bias in LVLMs stems from unbalanced position embeddings, and BaPA effectively mitigates this issue by promoting balanced cross-modal interaction, improving both spatial robustness and overall performance.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations
remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study
of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key
visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a
carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often
produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental
limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that
this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably
perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the
unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In
particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,
introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at
different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple
yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image
tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive
experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without
retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of
information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more
holistic visual understanding.

*Abdelrahman Eldesokey,Aleksandar Cvejic,Bernard Ghanem,Peter Wonka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel approach to disentangle visual and semantic features from pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual correspondence similar to semantic correspondence, with applications in quantifying and localizing visual inconsistencies in subject-driven image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion model backbones contain both semantic and visual features, but isolating visual features is challenging due to lack of annotated datasets. This work aims to separate these features to enable better analysis of visual inconsistencies in generated images.

Method: An automated pipeline constructs image pairs with annotated semantic and visual correspondences using existing subject-driven image generation datasets, and a contrastive architecture is designed to separate the two feature types.

Result: The proposed Visual Semantic Matching (VSM) metric outperforms global feature-based metrics like CLIP, DINO, and vision-language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions.

Conclusion: This is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, providing a valuable tool for advancing this task.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features
from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual
correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic
correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode
semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support
their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is
challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we
introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated
semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image
generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two
feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new
metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies
in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach
outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and
vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also
enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this
is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of
inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for
advancing this task. Project

TL;DR: WAVE introduces unified audio-visual embeddings using multimodal LLMs, enabling any-to-any cross-modal retrieval and prompt-aware embeddings through hierarchical feature fusion and joint multi-modal training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLM embeddings are underutilized for dynamic modalities like audio and video, creating a need for unified representations across text, audio, and video.

Method: Uses hierarchical feature fusion strategy and joint multi-modal, multi-task training to create unified embeddings that support cross-modal retrieval and prompt-aware generation.

Result: Sets new SOTA on MMEB-v2 video benchmark, achieves superior audio/video-to-audio retrieval, and significantly outperforms existing models in multimodal QA through prompt-aware embeddings.

Conclusion: WAVE enables broad cross-modal applications through unified representations, with ablation studies validating the joint training approach and improved performance across all modalities.

Abstract: While embeddings from multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel as
general-purpose representations, their application to dynamic modalities like
audio and video remains underexplored. We introduce WAVE (\textbf{u}nified \&
\textbf{v}ersatile \textbf{a}udio-\textbf{v}isual \textbf{e}mbeddings), the
first LLM-based embedding that creates a unified representation space for text,
audio, and video modalities. WAVE employs a novel hierarchical feature fusion
strategy and a joint multi-modal, multi-task training approach to enable two
key capabilities: any-to-any cross-modal retrieval and the generation of
prompt-aware embeddings tailored to user instructions. Experimentally, WAVE
sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark and achieves
superior results in audio and video-to-audio retrieval. Its prompt-aware nature
also yields remarkable performance in multimodal question answering,
significantly outperforming existing embedding models. Ablation studies
validate our joint training strategy, demonstrating improved performance across
all modalities. With a newly introduced benchmark for versatile audio-visual
learning, WAVE opens up broad possibilities for cross-modal, any-to-any
applications. Our code, checkpoints, and data will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERGO is an efficient vision-language model that uses a two-stage coarse-to-fine reasoning approach to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy by focusing only on relevant image regions at full resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large Vision-Language Models incur substantial computational overhead due to processing large numbers of vision tokens, especially for high-resolution images. There's a need for more efficient processing while preserving fine-grained visual details.

Method: Two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first analyzes downsampled image to identify task-relevant regions, then crops only these regions at full resolution for processing. Uses ERGO with reasoning-driven perception and reinforcement learning framework to handle perceptual uncertainty.

Result: ERGO achieves higher accuracy than original models and competitive methods with greater efficiency. For example, surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on V* benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of vision tokens, achieving 3x inference speedup.

Conclusion: The proposed ERGO framework effectively reduces computational costs in vision-language models while improving accuracy through selective high-resolution processing of relevant image regions, demonstrating significant efficiency gains across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world
vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of
vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now
extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our
two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is
analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are
cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This
approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual
details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are
truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first
stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where
clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this
issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs
reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to
focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped
region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,
we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning
framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach
delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with
greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*
benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a
3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at:

TL;DR: DualFocus is a novel Depth-from-Focus framework that uses dual constraints (spatial and focal) to improve depth estimation accuracy in complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based DFF methods struggle in complex scenes where focus cues become ambiguous due to fine textures or abrupt depth changes, leading to inaccurate depth estimation.

Method: Introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints: spatial constraints analyze gradient pattern changes across focus levels to distinguish depth edges from texture artifacts, and focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with physical focus behavior.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets show DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: The dual constraint approach with spatial and focal inductive biases significantly improves robustness and accuracy in challenging DFF scenarios.

Abstract: Depth-from-Focus (DFF) enables precise depth estimation by analyzing focus
cues across a stack of images captured at varying focal lengths. While recent
learning-based approaches have advanced this field, they often struggle in
complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes, where focus cues may
become ambiguous or misleading. We present DualFocus, a novel DFF framework
that leverages the focal stack's unique gradient patterns induced by focus
variation, jointly modeling focus changes over spatial and focal dimensions.
Our approach introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints
tailored to DFF: spatial constraints exploit gradient pattern changes across
focus levels to distinguish true depth edges from texture artifacts, while
focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with
physical focus behavior. These inductive biases improve robustness and accuracy
in challenging regions. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on collaborative perception lacked theoretical foundation for the trade-off between task performance and communication volume in multi-agent systems with limited bandwidth.

Method: Proposes RDcomm framework with two innovations: task entropy discrete coding to assign task-relevant codeword-lengths, and mutual-information-driven message selection using neural estimation to eliminate redundancy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V datasets for 3D object detection and BEV segmentation while reducing communication volume by up to 108 times.

Conclusion: The proposed rate-distortion theory and RDcomm framework provide both theoretical foundation and practical solution for communication-efficient collaborative perception in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Collaborative perception emphasizes enhancing environmental understanding by
enabling multiple agents to share visual information with limited bandwidth
resources. While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task
performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the
theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and
introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration,
specifically formulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in
goal-oriented multi-agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions
for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically
relevant information and transmitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these
two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative
perception framework that introduces two key innovations: i) task entropy
discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to
maximize the efficiency in supplying pragmatic information; ii)
mutual-information-driven message selection, which utilizes mutual information
neural estimation to approach the optimal redundancy-less condition.
Experiments on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation demonstrate that RDcomm
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V, while reducing
communication volume by up to 108 times. The code will be released.

Motivation: Static benchmarks have limited diagnostic power for uncovering systematic failures in T2I models and isolating their root causes, necessitating a complementary active exploration paradigm.

Method: Frames error discovery as structured search for minimal failure-inducing concepts, using novel acceleration techniques to make the computationally explosive problem tractable.

Result: Applied to Stable Diffusion models, discovered over 247,000 previously unknown error slices in SD1.5 alone and provided first large-scale evidence linking failures to training data scarcity.

Conclusion: Establishes a new diagnostic-first methodology for deep model auditing to guide development of more robust generative AI, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Static benchmarks have provided a valuable foundation for comparing
Text-to-Image (T2I) models. However, their passive design offers limited
diagnostic power, struggling to uncover the full landscape of systematic
failures or isolate their root causes. We argue for a complementary paradigm:
active exploration. We introduce FailureAtlas, the first framework designed to
autonomously explore and map the vast failure landscape of T2I models at scale.
FailureAtlas frames error discovery as a structured search for minimal,
failure-inducing concepts. While it is a computationally explosive problem, we
make it tractable with novel acceleration techniques. When applied to Stable
Diffusion models, our method uncovers hundreds of thousands of previously
unknown error slices (over 247,000 in SD1.5 alone) and provides the first
large-scale evidence linking these failures to data scarcity in the training
set. By providing a principled and scalable engine for deep model auditing,
FailureAtlas establishes a new, diagnostic-first methodology to guide the

*Youxu Shi,Suorong Yang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method that reduces hallucinations in multimodal LLMs by projecting captions to visual space to create negative anchors, then editing decoder hidden states to pull representations toward faithful semantics and push away from hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from persistent hallucinations across objects, attributes, and relations, even in larger models. Existing mitigation approaches require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or compromise informativeness and scalability.

Method: Proposes hallucination amplification: project captions into visual space via text-to-image model to reveal implicit hallucination signals as negative anchors, while original image provides positive anchors. Then edit decoder hidden states by pulling toward faithful semantics and pushing away from hallucination directions.

Result: Significantly reduces hallucinations at object, attribute, and relation levels while preserving recall and caption richness. Achieves over 5% hallucination reduction on CHAIR using LLaVA-v1.5-7B. Shows strong cross-architecture generalization across LLaVA-NEXT-7B, Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B.

Conclusion: The method is training-free, requires no human priors or additional training costs, introduces almost no side effects on hallucination-free captions, and offers robust plug-and-play applicability across diverse MLLM architectures.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to
hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual
evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations,
persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often
require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that
compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we
propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation.
Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a
caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal
implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the
original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we
edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics
and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires
no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and
efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our
method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and
relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g.,
achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR.
Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B,
Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture
generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions,
our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and
practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoFFT is a training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human visual cognition through iterative foresight-focus thought cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are constrained by complex and redundant visual input, making them susceptible to interference and hallucinations due to inability to precisely discover required regions during reasoning.

Method: Three-stage iterative process: (1) Generate diverse reasoning samples, (2) Evaluate samples based on visual focus and reasoning progression, (3) Adjust visual focus toward beneficial regions, then repeat until final answer.

Result: Consistent performance improvements of 3.1-5.8% across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next models.

Conclusion: CoFFT effectively enhances VLM reasoning by creating an interdependent cycle where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent reasoning, with controllable computational overhead.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain
constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images
contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to
interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or
even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and
process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this
limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel
training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human
visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1)
Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore
potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps;
(2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both
visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample
to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual
focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to
stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final
answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle
where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent
reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL,
InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of
3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

Abstract: Healthcare robotics requires robust multimodal perception and reasoning to
ensure safety in dynamic clinical environments. Current Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) demonstrate strong general-purpose capabilities but remain limited in
temporal reasoning, uncertainty estimation, and structured outputs needed for
robotic planning. We present a lightweight agentic multimodal framework for
video-based scene understanding. Combining the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model
with a SmolAgent-based orchestration layer, it supports chain-of-thought
reasoning, speech-vision fusion, and dynamic tool invocation. The framework
generates structured scene graphs and leverages a hybrid retrieval module for
interpretable and adaptive reasoning. Evaluations on the Video-MME benchmark
and a custom clinical dataset show competitive accuracy and improved robustness
compared to state-of-the-art VLMs, demonstrating its potential for applications
in robot-assisted surgery, patient monitoring, and decision support.

### [97] [EgoInstruct: An Egocentric Video Dataset of Face-to-face Instructional Interactions with Multi-modal LLM Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22019)
*Yuki Sakai,Ryosuke Furuta,Juichun Yen,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new egocentric video dataset for analyzing face-to-face instructional interactions and benchmarks multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against conventional models on procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face-to-face instructional interactions in physical spaces have not been systematically studied in computer vision due to lack of suitable datasets and limited analytical techniques, despite being critical for educational support and skill transfer.

Method: Created a new egocentric video dataset with ground-truth annotations for procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Benchmarked multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that jointly process images, audio, and text against conventional task-specific models.

Result: MLLMs outperformed specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating their capability for holistic understanding of instructional interactions that involve multiple modalities including speech content/prosody, gaze, body motion, and visual context.

Conclusion: Multimodal large language models show promise for comprehensive understanding of face-to-face instructional scenes by effectively integrating verbal and nonverbal communication modalities.

Abstract: Analyzing instructional interactions between an instructor and a learner who
are co-present in the same physical space is a critical problem for educational
support and skill transfer. Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not
been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i)
the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address
this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction
and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a
first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions:
procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this
dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against
conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves
multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and
visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal
and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate
recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This
evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models
understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform
specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their
promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

*Chao Huang,Susan Liang,Yapeng Tian,Anurag Kumar,Chenliang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAVIS is a diffusion-based audio-visual separation framework that uses generative models (DDPM and Flow Matching) to directly synthesize separated sound spectrograms from noise, conditioned on mixed audio and visual inputs, achieving superior separation quality across diverse sound categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mask-based regression methods for audio-visual sound separation face limitations in capturing complex data distributions needed for high-quality separation of diverse sound categories.

Method: Leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Flow Matching (FM) within a specialized Separation U-Net architecture to synthesize separated sound spectrograms directly from noise distribution, conditioned on mixed audio and visual information.

Result: Both DAVIS variants (DDPM and Flow Matching) surpass existing approaches in separation quality on AVE and MUSIC datasets, demonstrating superior performance in audio-visual source separation.

Conclusion: The generative framework of DAVIS proves highly effective for audio-visual sound source separation, particularly adept at producing high-quality separations for diverse sound categories.

Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that
solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative
learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based
regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face
limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for
high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS
circumvents these issues by leveraging potent generative modeling paradigms,
specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and the more
recent Flow Matching (FM), integrated within a specialized Separation U-Net
architecture. Our framework operates by synthesizing the desired separated
sound spectrograms directly from a noise distribution, conditioned concurrently
on the mixed audio input and associated visual information. The inherent nature
of its generative objective makes DAVIS particularly adept at producing
high-quality sound separations for diverse sound categories. We present
comparative evaluations of DAVIS, encompassing both its DDPM and Flow Matching
variants, against leading methods on the standard AVE and MUSIC datasets. The
results affirm that both variants surpass existing approaches in separation
quality, highlighting the efficacy of our generative framework for tackling the
audio-visual source separation task.

*Inzamamul Alam,Md Tanvir Islam,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecXNet is a dual-domain deepfake detection architecture that combines spatial and spectral features using a Dual-Domain Feature Coupler and Dual Fourier Attention modules to achieve robust detection across various manipulation types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing realism of GANs and diffusion models makes deepfake detection challenging, and existing approaches focusing only on spatial or frequency features have limited generalization to unseen manipulations.

Method: Proposes SpecXNet with Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC) that decomposes features into local spatial branch for texture anomalies and global spectral branch using FFT for periodic inconsistencies, plus Dual Fourier Attention (DFA) for dynamic feature fusion, built on modified XceptionNet backbone.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on multiple deepfake benchmarks, particularly under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining real-time feasibility.

Conclusion: Unified spatial-spectral learning is effective for robust and generalizable deepfake detection, as demonstrated by SpecXNet's superior performance across various test conditions.

Abstract: The increasing realism of content generated by GANs and diffusion models has
made deepfake detection significantly more challenging. Existing approaches
often focus solely on spatial or frequency-domain features, limiting their
generalization to unseen manipulations. We propose the Spectral
Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet), a dual-domain architecture for robust
deepfake detection. The core \textbf{Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)}
decomposes features into a local spatial branch for capturing texture-level
anomalies and a global spectral branch that employs Fast Fourier Transform to
model periodic inconsistencies. This dual-domain formulation allows SpecXNet to
jointly exploit localized detail and global structural coherence, which are
critical for distinguishing authentic from manipulated images. We also
introduce the \textbf{Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)} module, which dynamically
fuses spatial and spectral features in a content-aware manner. Built atop a
modified XceptionNet backbone, we embed the DDFC and DFA modules within a
separable convolution block. Extensive experiments on multiple deepfake
benchmarks show that SpecXNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly
under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining
real-time feasibility. Our results highlight the effectiveness of unified
spatial-spectral learning for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. To
ensure reproducibility, we released the full code on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGM is a framework that generates 3D content with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials (albedo, roughness, metallic) rather than just RGB textures, enabling dynamic relighting in various lighting environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D reconstruction models fail to produce material properties needed for realistic rendering in diverse lighting conditions, limiting their practical applications.

Method: Fine-tunes a multiview material diffusion model conditioned on depth/normal maps, then uses Gaussian material representation aligned with 2D Gaussian Splatting to model PBR material channels from generated multiview PBR images.

Result: Produces materials with greater visual appeal than baseline methods and enhances material modeling, enabling practical downstream rendering applications with dynamic relighting.

Conclusion: MGM successfully generates high-quality 3D content with PBR materials, overcoming limitations of existing models and enabling realistic rendering in diverse lighting environments.

Abstract: The increasing demand for 3D assets across various industries necessitates
efficient and automated methods for 3D content creation. Leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting, recent large reconstruction models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
ability to efficiently achieve high-quality 3D rendering by integrating
multiview diffusion for generation and scalable transformers for
reconstruction. However, existing models fail to produce the material
properties of assets, which is crucial for realistic rendering in diverse
lighting environments. In this paper, we introduce the Large Material Gaussian
Model (MGM), a novel framework designed to generate high-quality 3D content
with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, ie, albedo, roughness, and
metallic properties, rather than merely producing RGB textures with
uncontrolled light baking. Specifically, we first fine-tune a new multiview
material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps. Utilizing
the generated multiview PBR images, we explore a Gaussian material
representation that not only aligns with 2D Gaussian Splatting but also models
each channel of the PBR materials. The reconstructed point clouds can then be
rendered to acquire PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting by applying
various ambient light maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
materials produced by our method not only exhibit greater visual appeal
compared to baseline methods but also enhance material modeling, thereby
enabling practical downstream rendering applications.

*Jingjing Lu,Huilong Pi,Yunchuan Qin,Zhuo Tang,Ruihui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel self-supervised point cloud completion method using multi-view augmentations and Mamba architecture to overcome limitations of supervised, unsupervised, and existing self-supervised approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current point cloud completion methods have limitations: supervised methods rely on ground truth and suffer from synthetic-to-real domain gap, unsupervised methods need complete point clouds, weakly-supervised methods require multi-view observations, and existing self-supervised methods produce unsatisfactory predictions due to limited self-supervised signals.

Method: Proposes self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of single partial point clouds and incorporates Mamba architecture to enhance learning capability for better quality point cloud generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised method with multi-view augmentations and Mamba architecture effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches and demonstrates superior performance in point cloud completion tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete shapes from partial
observations. Although current methods have achieved remarkable performance,
they still have some limitations: Supervised methods heavily rely on ground
truth, which limits their generalization to real-world datasets due to the
synthetic-to-real domain gap. Unsupervised methods require complete point
clouds to compose unpaired training data, and weakly-supervised methods need
multi-view observations of the object. Existing self-supervised methods
frequently produce unsatisfactory predictions due to the limited capabilities
of their self-supervised signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel self-supervised point cloud completion method. We design a set of novel
self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of the single partial
point cloud. Additionally, to enhance the model's learning ability, we first
incorporate Mamba into self-supervised point cloud completion task, encouraging
the model to generate point clouds with better quality. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High resource demands of conditional image generation models and scarcity of well-annotated data hinder deployment on edge devices, causing high costs and privacy concerns when user data is sent to third parties.

Method: Proposes a semi-supervised distillation framework with tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different levels of knowledge, utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data to enhance generalization and address dataset scarcity.

Result: Achieves significant reductions in computational cost and latency while maintaining high-fidelity generation capabilities and controllability, as measured by comparative metrics.

Conclusion: Refine-Control effectively addresses the challenges of deploying conditional image generation models on edge devices through efficient knowledge distillation and semi-supervised learning.

Abstract: Conditional image generation models have achieved remarkable results by
leveraging text-based control to generate customized images. However, the high
resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have
hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and
privacy concerns, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised
distillation framework. Specifically, we improve the performance of the student
model by introducing a tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different
levels of knowledge. To enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity,
we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and
unlabeled data. Our experiments reveal that Refine-Control achieves significant
reductions in computational cost and latency, while maintaining high-fidelity
generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative
metrics.

TL;DR: JGEKD is a classification strategy for non-IID 3D point clouds that uses joint graph entropy knowledge distillation to capture class correlations and improve robustness against corruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D point cloud classification assumes IID data, which destroys class correlations. This paper addresses non-IID scenarios where class relationships matter.

Method: Uses joint graphs to capture hidden class relationships, constructs loss function based on joint graph entropy, implements knowledge distillation, and builds Siamese structures with self-knowledge and teacher-knowledge distillation frameworks for spatial transformation invariance.

Result: Extensive experiments on ScanObject, ModelNet40, ScanntV2_cls and ModelNet-C datasets demonstrate competitive performance.

*Jonas Belouadi,Tamy Boubekeur,Adrien Kaiser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiMat is a multimodal program synthesis framework that uses large multimodal models to generate procedural material node graphs by processing both visual and textual representations, outperforming text-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural program synthesis methods only use textual representations, failing to capture the visual-spatial nature of material node graphs that makes them intuitive for humans to work with.

Method: Leverages large multimodal models trained on production-quality procedural materials, combined with a constrained tree search inference algorithm to ensure syntactic validity while efficiently exploring the program space.

Result: MultiMat achieves higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in both unconditional and conditional graph synthesis.

Conclusion: Multimodal program synthesis that incorporates both visual and textual representations is more effective for generating procedural material graphs than text-only approaches.

Abstract: Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural
materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and
reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in
computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects
parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed
acyclic graph structures and intermediate states provide an intuitive
understanding and workflow for interactive appearance modeling. Creating such
graphs is a challenging task and typically requires professional training.
While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this
process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture
the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible
to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program
synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both
visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural
material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality
procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference
algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently navigating the
program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program
synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph
synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines,
establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN, and PCA to improve latent space efficiency and controllability in GAN-generated images, achieving faster optimization while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency and interpretability of latent space manipulation in GANs by combining dimensionality reduction with intuitive image editing capabilities.

Method: Combines StyleGAN's structured latent space, DragGAN's intuitive manipulation, and PCA for dimensionality reduction and cross-model alignment, applied to AFHQ dataset.

Result: PCA integration reduces optimization time while maintaining visual quality and improving SSIM, especially in shallower latent spaces (W+ layers=3). Successfully aligns images from different StyleGAN models (AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat).

Conclusion: Demonstrates efficient and interpretable latent space control for image synthesis and editing applications through integrated PCA and DragGAN framework.

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated
images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive
image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model
alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces.
We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and
find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with
the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while
improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+
layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while
maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent
spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images
generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains
(AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these
aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable
manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable
latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing
applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient document parsing model that can handle high-resolution inputs without computational overhead while preserving fine-grained details in complex document elements.

Method: Two-stage parsing strategy: first stage performs layout analysis on downsampled images for structural elements, second stage performs targeted content recognition on native-resolution crops guided by the layout analysis. Supported by a comprehensive data engine for training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

Conclusion: MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability with exceptional computational efficiency through its coarse-to-fine parsing approach and comprehensive training data generation.

Abstract: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language
model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local
content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout
analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both
general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models in remote sensing fail at complex analytical tasks due to end-to-end training that bypasses reasoning steps and produces unverifiable outputs.

Method: Two-stage alignment strategy: supervised fine-tuning to instill cognitive architecture, then Group Reward Policy Optimization to refine reasoning policy towards factual correctness, using Geo-CoT380k dataset.

Result: RSThinker model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across comprehensive tasks while providing verifiable analytical traces.

Conclusion: Geo-CoT framework provides a pathway from opaque perception to structured, verifiable reasoning in Earth Observation, with public release of dataset and model.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing often fail at complex
analytical tasks, a limitation stemming from their end-to-end training paradigm
that bypasses crucial reasoning steps and leads to unverifiable outputs. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial
Chain-of-Thought (Geo-CoT), a framework that models remote sensing analysis as
a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a
two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale
dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive
architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine
the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model,
RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable
analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks.
The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon
publication serves as a concrete pathway from opaque perception towards

TL;DR: MUSplat is a training-free framework that lifts 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes without per-scene retraining, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome three key flaws in mainstream methods: reliance on costly per-scene retraining, restrictive monosemous design that fails to represent multi-concept semantics, and vulnerability to cross-view semantic inconsistencies.

Method: Leverages pre-trained 2D segmentation model to generate multi-granularity 2D masks, lifts them into 3D, estimates foreground probability for Gaussian points, optimizes boundaries using semantic entropy and geometric opacity, and uses Vision-Language Model to distill robust textual features for open-vocabulary querying.

Result: Reduces scene adaptation time from hours to minutes, outperforms established training-based frameworks on open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation tasks, and addresses monosemous limitations.

Conclusion: MUSplat provides an effective training-free solution for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding that eliminates costly per-scene training while achieving superior performance and handling complex multi-concept semantics.

Abstract: Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three
key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents
plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to
represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to
cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework
that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D
segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks
into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to
form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these
initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by
interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles
visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic
matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces
scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for
open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat
outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously
addressing their monosemous limitations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanFeel is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models' understanding of urban development and subjective environmental perception, featuring 14.3K visual questions across three dimensions: static scene perception, temporal change understanding, and subjective perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for MLLMs in urban environments are limited and lack systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception that aligns with human perception, despite urban development impacting over half the global population.

Method: Collected multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generated high-quality question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering, rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation.

Result: Gemini-2.5 Pro achieved the best overall performance, approaching human expert levels with only 1.5% average gap. Most models performed well on scene understanding tasks, with some surpassing humans in pixel-level change detection. Performance dropped in temporal reasoning tasks, while several models reached human-level consistency in subjective perception dimensions like beauty and safety.

Conclusion: UrbanFeel provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in urban environments, revealing that while models excel at scene understanding and can match human performance in some subjective perception tasks, they struggle with temporal reasoning about urban development.

Abstract: Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making
human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential
for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks
that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking
systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban
environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we
propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective
environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed
visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static
Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental
Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view
images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality
question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering,
rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through
extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5
Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human
expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform
well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even
surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance
drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development.
Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach
human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as
beautiful and safety.

*Jiaping Yu,Muli Yang,Jiapeng Ji,Jiexi Yan,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EXCL proposes a dual experts framework with retrieval-augmented interaction for source-free unsupervised domain adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance without accessing source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and cost concerns in domain adaptation by adapting source-trained models to target domains without accessing source data, overcoming limitations of existing methods that neglect complementary insights and latent target data structure.

Method: Dual Experts framework with frozen source-domain model (Conv-Adapter) and pretrained vision-language model (trainable text prompt), plus Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction pipeline with three stages: collaborative sample retrieval, separate expert fine-tuning, and learning object consistency enforcement.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the approach matches state-of-the-art performance in source-free unsupervised domain adaptation.

Conclusion: EXCL effectively addresses SFUDA challenges by leveraging dual experts and retrieval-augmented interaction, providing a robust solution for domain adaptation without source data access.

Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic
challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access
to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA
methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large
multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent
structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative
Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and
Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts
framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and
a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal
footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To
effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions,
we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that
(1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2)
separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3)
enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing with diffusion models has achieved remarkable
quality but suffers from prohibitive latency, hindering real-world
applications. We introduce FlashEdit, a novel framework designed to enable
high-fidelity, real-time image editing. Its efficiency stems from three key
innovations: (1) a One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) pipeline that bypasses
costly iterative processes; (2) a Background Shield (BG-Shield) technique that
guarantees background preservation by selectively modifying features only
within the edit region; and (3) a Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA)
mechanism that ensures precise, localized edits by suppressing semantic leakage
to the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashEdit maintains
superior background consistency and structural integrity, while performing
edits in under 0.2 seconds, which is an over 150$\times$ speedup compared to
prior multi-step methods. Our code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: Neural-MedBench is a compact but reasoning-intensive benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal clinical reasoning in neurology, revealing significant performance drops in state-of-the-art vision-language models compared to conventional datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical benchmarks focus too much on classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion where models appear proficient but fail at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. There's a need to probe the true clinical reasoning ability of vision-language models.

Method: Created Neural-MedBench integrating multi-sequence MRI scans, structured EHRs, and clinical notes with three core tasks: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation. Used a hybrid scoring pipeline combining LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity metrics.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs (GPT-4o, Claude-4, MedGemma) showed sharp performance drops compared to conventional datasets. Error analysis revealed reasoning failures dominate model shortcomings rather than perceptual errors.

Conclusion: Proposes a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets for statistical generalization and depth-oriented compact benchmarks like Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. Released as an open diagnostic testbed for rigorous assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning
ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize
classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear
proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We
introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark
specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in
neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured
electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task
families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation.
To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that
combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity
metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to
conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather
than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the
necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets
for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as
Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at
https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed,
which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet
cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMapGen is a generative framework for large-scale map construction that represents lane lines as discrete sequences, supports multi-modal inputs, and uses state updates for global consistency, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional map construction methods are costly and inefficient, while satellite-based methods suffer from data limitations (occlusions, outdatedness) and produce rough roads requiring extensive post-processing.

Method: Represents lane lines as discrete sequences with iterative generation, supports multi-modal inputs (BEV, PV, text prompts), and employs state update strategy for global continuity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on OpenSatMap dataset, can infer occluded roads and predict missing roads from dataset annotations.

Conclusion: UniMapGen provides an efficient generative framework that overcomes limitations of traditional and satellite-based map construction methods, enabling more complete and smooth map generation.

Abstract: Large-scale map construction is foundational for critical applications such
as autonomous driving and navigation systems. Traditional large-scale map
construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data
collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing
satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the
efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major
limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions,
outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods,
resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive
post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen,
for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1)
representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an
iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than
traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture
that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among
BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3)
developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and
consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. Furthermore, UniMapGen
can infer occluded roads and predict roads missing from dataset annotations.
Our code will be released.

*Dinh Minh Nguyen,Malte Avenhaus,Thomas Lindemeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS-2M is a unified framework for mesh reconstruction and material decomposition from multi-view images using 3D Gaussian Splatting, achieving high-quality results without relying on external priors or complex neural components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods handle mesh reconstruction and material decomposition separately, struggle with reflective surfaces, and often rely on external priors. Current joint approaches use complex neural components that limit scalability.

Method: Joint optimization of depth and normal rendering attributes using 3D Gaussian Splatting, with a novel roughness supervision strategy based on multi-view photometric variation and carefully designed loss functions.

Result: Produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods, delivering triangle meshes and associated material components that are resilient to reflective surfaces.

Conclusion: GS-2M provides an effective unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material decomposition that eliminates complex neural components while maintaining geometric details and handling reflective surfaces.

Abstract: We propose a unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material
decomposition from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, referred
to as GS-2M. Previous works handle these tasks separately and struggle to
reconstruct highly reflective surfaces, often relying on priors from external
models to enhance the decomposition results. Conversely, our method addresses
these two problems by jointly optimizing attributes relevant to the quality of
rendered depth and normals, maintaining geometric details while being resilient
to reflective surfaces. Although contemporary works effectively solve these
tasks together, they often employ sophisticated neural components to learn
scene properties, which hinders their performance at scale. To further
eliminate these neural components, we propose a novel roughness supervision
strategy based on multi-view photometric variation. When combined with a
carefully designed loss and optimization process, our unified framework
produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods,
delivering triangle meshes and their associated material components for
downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with widely
used datasets from previous works and qualitative comparisons with
state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MesaTask, an LLM-based framework for task-oriented tabletop scene generation, using a Spatial Reasoning Chain and DPO algorithms to create realistic scenes aligned with human instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for creating tabletop scenes rely on manual layout design or randomized layouts, which are limited in plausibility and task alignment. There's a substantial gap between high-level task instructions and actual tabletop scenes.

Method: Proposed Spatial Reasoning Chain that decomposes generation into object inference, spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction. MesaTask framework uses LLMs enhanced with DPO algorithms for physically plausible layouts.

Result: Created MesaTask-10K dataset with 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes. Exhaustive experiments show MesaTask outperforms baselines in generating task-conforming scenes with realistic layouts.

Conclusion: MesaTask successfully bridges the gap between task instructions and tabletop scenes, generating physically plausible and task-aligned layouts through spatial reasoning and LLM enhancement.

Abstract: The ability of robots to interpret human instructions and execute
manipulation tasks necessitates the availability of task-relevant tabletop
scenes for training. However, traditional methods for creating these scenes
rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which
are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this
paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene
generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap
between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support
research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale
dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually
crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object
relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial
Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference,
spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D
layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this
reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate
physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task
descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes
with realistic layouts. Project page is at https://mesatask.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rule-based reinforcement learning improves document image classification with better generalization to out-of-distribution data across images, classes, and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the benefits of rule-based reinforcement learning in document analysis, particularly for enhanced reasoning capabilities and generalization, inspired by DeepSeek-R1's success.

Method: Applied rule-based reinforcement learning to Document Image Classification task and tested generalization on three scenarios: out-of-distribution images, unseen classes, and different modalities.

Result: Reinforcement learning demonstrated superior generalization capabilities compared to traditional methods across all three out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: Rule-based reinforcement learning is effective for document analysis tasks, offering improved generalization to diverse out-of-distribution data types.

Abstract: Rule-based reinforcement learning has been gaining popularity ever since
DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated its success through simple verifiable rewards. In
the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent,
even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of
reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study
the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document
Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks
in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better
generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in
three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes
and different modalities. Our code is available at

### [117] [Jailbreaking on Text-to-Video Models via Scene Splitting Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22292)
*Wonjun Lee,Haon Park,Doehyeon Lee,Bumsub Ham,Suhyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneSplit is a novel black-box jailbreak method for Text-to-Video models that fragments harmful narratives into multiple benign scenes to bypass safety filters and generate harmful videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-Video models have significant safety gaps and remain largely unexplored for jailbreak attacks compared to other AI models like LLMs and Text-to-Image models, creating a critical security vulnerability.

Method: SceneSplit works by splitting harmful narratives into multiple individually benign scenes, using scene combination to constrain the generative output space toward unsafe regions, enhanced with iterative scene manipulation and a strategy library for reusing successful attack patterns.

Result: SceneSplit achieves high attack success rates of 77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2 across 11 safety categories, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: Current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to narrative structure exploitation attacks, highlighting the need for improved safety measures in Text-to-Video models.

Abstract: Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models,
growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent
studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and
Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely
unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce
SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a
harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach
manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential
video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful
constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually
corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their
sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an
unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a
harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene
manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe
region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns
further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate
our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models.
Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of
77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly
outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that
current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative
structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of
T2V models.

*Seyedmorteza Sadat,Farnood Salehi,Romann M. Weber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiGS is a momentum-based sampling technique that improves diffusion model outputs by integrating past predictions, achieving better image quality with fewer steps and no extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models often produce unrealistic outputs with poor details when using fewer neural function evaluations or lower guidance scales.

Method: History-guided sampling (HiGS) leverages the difference between current predictions and weighted averages of past predictions to steer sampling toward more realistic outputs.

Result: HiGS achieves state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for unguided ImageNet generation at 256×256 with only 30 steps instead of standard 250, improving quality across diverse models.

Conclusion: HiGS is a plug-and-play enhancement that enables faster diffusion sampling with higher fidelity without additional computation or training.

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation,
their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially
when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance
scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling
technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and
efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into
each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the
current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the
sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and
structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and
integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither
extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS
consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and
under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a
pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for
unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps
(instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play
enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with
higher fidelity.

TL;DR: VeloxSeg is a lightweight 3D medical image segmentation method that overcomes the efficiency/robustness conflict through a dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture with Paired Window Attention and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided convolution, achieving significant performance improvements and computational efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental 'efficiency / robustness conflict' in lightweight 3D medical image segmentation, particularly for complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities, by redesigning the framework based on high-dimensional 3D image characteristics and exploring data synergy.

Method: VeloxSeg uses a dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture with Paired Window Attention (PWA) for multi-scale information retrieval and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided convolution (JLC) for robust local feature extraction. It employs a 'glance-and-focus' principle, modal interaction for heterogeneous modalities, and Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer (SDKT) via Gram matrices to inject texture priors from self-supervised networks.

Result: VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement on multimodal benchmarks, while increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU throughput by 48x compared to baselines.

Conclusion: VeloxSeg successfully overcomes the efficiency/robustness conflict in lightweight 3D medical image segmentation, providing significant performance improvements and computational efficiency gains without extra inference cost, making it suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Lightweight 3D medical image segmentation remains constrained by a
fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict", particularly when processing
complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we
study how to redesign the framework based on the characteristics of
high-dimensional 3D images, and explore data synergy to overcome the fragile
representation of lightweight methods. Our approach, VeloxSeg, begins with a
deployable and extensible dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture composed of
Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided
convolution (JLC). For each 3D image, we invoke a "glance-and-focus" principle,
where PWA rapidly retrieves multi-scale information, and JLC ensures robust
local feature extraction with minimal parameters, significantly enhancing the
model's ability to operate with low computational budget. Followed by an
extension of the dual-stream architecture that incorporates modal interaction
into the multi-scale image-retrieval process, VeloxSeg efficiently models
heterogeneous modalities. Finally, Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer
(SDKT) via Gram matrices injects the texture prior extracted by a
self-supervised network into the segmentation network, yielding stronger
representations than baselines at no extra inference cost. Experimental results
on multimodal benchmarks show that VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement,
alongside increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU by 48x. Codes are available
at https://github.com/JinPLu/VeloxSeg.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPID3 is a training-free acceleration framework for Diffusion Transformers that uses three lightweight policy heads to achieve nearly 3x faster sampling while maintaining competitive generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DiT acceleration methods use uniform heuristics or manual adaptive strategies that sacrifice quality, while dynamic neural networks require costly fine-tuning. RAPID3 aims to provide per-image adaptive acceleration without updating the base generator.

Method: Uses three lightweight policy heads (Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, Sparse-Attention) that observe denoising state and independently decide speed-up at each timestep. Parameters are trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization while generator remains frozen, with an adversarial discriminator to prevent reward hacking.

Result: Achieves nearly 3x faster sampling across state-of-the-art DiT backbones including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX while maintaining competitive generation quality.

Conclusion: RAPID3 successfully enables image-wise adaptive acceleration for Diffusion Transformers without requiring updates to the base generator, addressing limitations of existing acceleration methods.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel at visual generation yet remain hampered
by slow sampling. Existing training-free accelerators - step reduction, feature
caching, and sparse attention - enhance inference speed but typically rely on a
uniform heuristic or a manually designed adaptive strategy for all images,
leaving quality on the table. Alternatively, dynamic neural networks offer
per-image adaptive acceleration, but their high fine-tuning costs limit broader
applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce RAPID3: Tri-Level
Reinforced Acceleration Policies for Diffusion Transformers, a framework that
delivers image-wise acceleration with zero updates to the base generator.
Specifically, three lightweight policy heads - Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, and
Sparse-Attention - observe the current denoising state and independently decide
their corresponding speed-up at each timestep. All policy parameters are
trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) while the
generator remains frozen. Meanwhile, an adversarially learned discriminator
augments the reward signal, discouraging reward hacking by boosting returns
only when generated samples stay close to the original model's distribution.
Across state-of-the-art DiT backbones, including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX,
RAPID3 achieves nearly 3x faster sampling with competitive generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PAR methods fail to fully exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information, and existing approaches using attribute text as additional input are still in their infancy, lacking effective relationship modeling between visual and semantic information.

Method: Constructs a multi-modal knowledge graph that considers relationships among attributes and between attributes and vision tokens, then uses a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance standard PAR.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed knowledge graph approach for PAR tasks.

Conclusion: The method establishes a strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition and the source code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Current Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) algorithms typically focus on
mapping visual features to semantic labels or attempt to enhance learning by
fusing visual and attribute information. However, these methods fail to fully
exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information for more accurate
recognition. Although recent works have started to consider using attribute
text as additional input to enhance the association between visual and semantic
information, these methods are still in their infancy. To address the above
challenges, this paper proposes the construction of a multi-modal knowledge
graph, which is utilized to mine the relationships between local visual
features and text, as well as the relationships between attributes and
extensive visual context samples. Specifically, we propose an effective
multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that fully considers the
relationships among attributes and the relationships between attributes and
vision tokens. To effectively model these relationships, this paper introduces
a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance
the standard pedestrian attribute recognition framework. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph for the PAR task, establishing a
strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored capability of MLLMs in extracting mathematical models from technical diagrams, particularly in engineering design workflows that require hierarchical abstraction from system specifications to component implementations.

Method: Created a hierarchical synthetic generation pipeline with grid-based schematic generator and block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels. Evaluated 6 state-of-the-art MLLMs on 8,006+ problems spanning component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams across Perception, Analysis, and Design tasks.

Result: Closed-source models achieved >85% accuracy on perception tasks but <19% on symbolic derivation and analytical reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities consistently achieved higher design task accuracy.

Conclusion: There is a critical gap between visual parsing and symbolic reasoning in MLLMs. Symbolic reasoning is established as the key metric for engineering competence, with mathematical understanding being fundamental for circuit synthesis.

Abstract: Engineering design operates through hierarchical abstraction from system
specifications to component implementations, requiring visual understanding
coupled with mathematical reasoning at each level. While Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract
mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present
\textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit
understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning
component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark
uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and
Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability
of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical
synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator
and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels.
Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in
visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\%
accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology
identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical
reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and
symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities
consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental
role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing
symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.

Conclusion: HierLight-YOLO effectively enhances real-time small object detection accuracy in drone-based scenarios through hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight architecture optimizations.

Abstract: The real-time detection of small objects in complex scenes, such as the
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography captured by drones, has dual
challenges of detecting small targets (<32 pixels) and maintaining real-time
efficiency on resource-constrained platforms. While YOLO-series detectors have
achieved remarkable success in real-time large object detection, they suffer
from significantly higher false negative rates for drone-based detection where
small objects dominate, compared to large object scenarios. This paper proposes
HierLight-YOLO, a hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight model that
enhances the real-time detection of small objects, based on the YOLOv8
architecture. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network
(HEPAN), a multi-scale feature fusion method through hierarchical cross-level
connections, enhancing the small object detection accuracy. HierLight-YOLO
includes two innovative lightweight modules: Inverted Residual Depthwise
Convolution Block (IRDCB) and Lightweight Downsample (LDown) module, which
significantly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity
without sacrificing detection capabilities. Small object detection head is
designed to further enhance spatial resolution and feature fusion to tackle the
tiny object (4 pixels) detection. Comparison experiments and ablation studies
on the VisDrone2019 benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
HierLight-YOLO.

*Kaziwa Saleh,Zhyar Rzgar K Rostam,Sándor Szénási,Zoltán Vámossy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using GPT-4 with specialized prompts to predict occlusion order relationships between objects in images without training data, achieving better accuracy than baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusion is a major challenge for vision models in interpreting complex real-world scenes, and current methods struggle with predicting accurate occlusion order relationships.

Method: Leverage pre-trained GPT-4 with specifically designed prompts to analyze images and generate occlusion order predictions, then parse responses to construct occlusion matrices.

Result: Evaluation on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets shows the model produces more accurate order predictions using semantic context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge.

Conclusion: GPT-4 can effectively reason about occlusion relationships in zero-shot fashion without annotated training data, making it easily integrable into occlusion handling frameworks.

Abstract: Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to
robustly interpret complex and dense real-world images and scenes. To address
this limitation and to enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order
relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of
a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically
designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and
generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an
occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion
handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the
model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic
context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more
accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about
occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated
training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks.

*Haoyu Li,XiaoSong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-focus image fusion method that enhances boundary quality using gradient-domain modeling and Tenengrad gradient detection to preserve sharp focus-defocus transitions and prevent detail loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MFIF methods struggle with preserving sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often causing blurred transitions and loss of focused details, which is problematic for applications like surveillance and microscopy.

Method: Proposes a gradient-domain-based model for initial fusion with complete boundaries, uses Tenengrad gradient detection for salient feature extraction, and develops a focus metric integrating gradient and complementary information for boundary refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public datasets show the method consistently outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively generates high-quality fused boundaries while accurately detecting focus information, achieving superior performance in multi-focus image fusion tasks.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) aims to yield an all-focused image from
multiple partially focused inputs, which is crucial in applications cover
sur-veillance, microscopy, and computational photography. However, existing
methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in
blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose
a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates
high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation.
Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial
fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary
details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract
salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image,
generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop
a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the
salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize
focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive
experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective
evaluations. We have realized codes in https://github.com/Lihyua/GICI

*Wenqiang Wang,Siyuan Liang,Xiao Yan,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TDOA is a text adversarial attack method that handles dynamic-output scenarios by converting them to static scenarios using clustering-based surrogate training, achieving high attack success rates with minimal queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text adversarial attack methods are designed for static scenarios with fixed labels and require extensive model querying, creating a gap for dynamic-output scenarios.

Method: Uses clustering-based surrogate model training to convert dynamic-output scenarios to static single-output scenarios, and employs farthest-label targeted attack strategy to maximize disruption.

Result: Achieves maximum attack success rate of 50.81% with single query per text on dynamic scenarios, and 82.68% on static scenarios. Also extends to generative settings with improvements of up to 0.64 RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

Conclusion: TDOA effectively addresses dynamic-output scenarios, demonstrates strong attack capability with limited access, and shows state-of-the-art performance across both static and generative settings.

Abstract: Text adversarial attack methods are typically designed for static scenarios
with fixed numbers of output labels and a predefined label space, relying on
extensive querying of the victim model (query-based attacks) or the surrogate
model (transfer-based attacks). To address this gap, we introduce the Textual
Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based
surrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a
static single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the
farthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that
deviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing
disruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim
models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting
adversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language
models with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a
maximum attack success rate of 50.81\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also
achieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios,
reaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\%. Meanwhile, by conceptualizing translation
tasks as classification problems with unbounded output spaces, we extend the
TDOA framework to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64
RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

### [129] [Integrating Background Knowledge in Medical Semantic Segmentation with Logic Tensor Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22399)
*Luca Bergamin,Giovanna Maria Dimitri,Fabio Aiolli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Incorporating medical knowledge via Logic Tensor Networks improves semantic segmentation performance in medical imaging, especially with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning systems for medical semantic segmentation are imperfect and could benefit from incorporating domain-specific medical knowledge to improve performance.

Method: Use Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic rules, combined with SwinUNETR in an end-to-end framework for semantic segmentation.

Result: LTNs improved baseline segmentation performance, particularly when training data was scarce, in hippocampus segmentation from brain MRI scans.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic methods like LTNs are generalizable and can be adapted to other medical semantic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding
medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an
image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications,
which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise
and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that
performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the
segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor
Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic
(FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the
produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We
apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic
segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus
in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline
segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite
being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are
general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation
tasks.

### [130] [Closing the Safety Gap: Surgical Concept Erasure in Visual Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22400)
*Xinhao Zhong,Yimin Zhou,Zhiqi Zhang,Junhao Li,Yi Sun,Bin Chen,Shu-Tao Xia,Ke Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VARE and S-VARE are novel frameworks for concept erasure in visual autoregressive models that address safety concerns by using auxiliary visual tokens and filtered loss functions to achieve precise erasure while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure techniques designed for diffusion models fail to work with visual autoregressive (VAR) models due to their next-scale token prediction paradigm, creating safety gaps in text-to-image generation.

Method: VARE uses auxiliary visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity, while S-VARE incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to identify and minimally adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain semantic fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation quality, effectively closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: The proposed VARE and S-VARE frameworks successfully enable stable concept erasure in VAR models, addressing issues like language drift and reduced diversity that arise from naive fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new
opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety
concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion
models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction
paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE
that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary
visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce
S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which
incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally
adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain
semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced
diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation
quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image
generation by earlier methods.

### [131] [RAU: Reference-based Anatomical Understanding with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22404)
*Yiwei Li,Yikang Liu,Jiaqi Guo,Lin Zhao,Zheyuan Zhang,Xiao Chen,Boris Mailhe,Ankush Mukherjee,Terrence Chen,Shanhui Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAU is a framework that uses vision-language models for reference-based anatomical understanding in medical imaging, enabling identification, localization and segmentation of anatomical structures by leveraging spatial reasoning between reference and target images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anatomical understanding in medical imaging is crucial for automated workflows but limited by scarce expert-labeled data. Reference-based approaches using annotated images can help interpret unlabeled targets, but current vision-language models lack fine-grained localization capabilities.

Method: RAU combines VLM spatial reasoning (trained on moderate datasets) with SAM2's segmentation capability. The VLM identifies anatomical regions through relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, then SAM2 performs pixel-level segmentation using these spatial cues.

Result: RAU outperforms SAM2 fine-tuning baseline across in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, achieving more accurate segmentations and reliable localization. It shows strong generalization to out-of-distribution data, crucial for medical applications.

Conclusion: RAU demonstrates the potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in clinical workflows, being the first framework to explore VLMs for reference-based identification, localization and segmentation in medical images.

Abstract: Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic
report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in
medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of
expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference
image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent
vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their
reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We
introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with
VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through
relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a
moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question
answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the
VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained
segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level
segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two
in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently
outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding
more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly,
its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution
datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our
knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for
reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical
structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the
potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated
clinical workflows.

### [132] [Vision-Language Alignment from Compressed Image Representations using 2D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22615)
*Yasmine Omri,Connor Ding,Tsachy Weissman,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is proposed as an alternative to RGB vision encoders for vision-language pipelines, offering 3-20x input compression and faster processing while maintaining semantic capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB vision encoders have structural inefficiencies: dense image transmission from edge devices is costly, and patch-based tokenization creates long sequences that stress attention mechanisms.

Method: Developed scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance-aware pruning, and optimized CUDA kernels. Adapted CLIP training using frozen RGB transformer backbone with splat-aware input stem and perceiver resampler, training only 7% of parameters.

Result: Achieved 90x faster fitting and 97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. GS encoders provide meaningful zero-shot ImageNet-1K performance with 3-20x input compression, though accuracy currently trails RGB encoders.

Conclusion: 2DGS is established as a viable multimodal substrate that addresses transmission efficiency for edge-cloud learning while maintaining semantic capabilities, though further work is needed to close the accuracy gap with RGB encoders.

Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on
massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero
shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two
structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB
images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)
patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets
and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative
visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation
that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop
a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware
pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about
97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt
contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen
RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a
perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large
DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K
performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While
accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable
multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path
toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission
efficient for edge cloud learning.

*Hossein Kashiani,Niloufar Alipour Talemi,Fatemeh Afghah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreqDebias is a frequency debiasing framework that addresses spectral bias in deepfake detectors through Forgery Mixup augmentation and dual consistency regularization, improving cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detectors often fail to generalize to novel forgery types due to spectral bias - over-reliance on specific frequency bands learned from limited training data.

Method: Proposes FreqDebias with two strategies: 1) Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup) augmentation to diversify frequency characteristics, and 2) dual consistency regularization using class activation maps and von Mises-Fisher distribution on hyperspherical embedding space.

Result: Extensive experiments show FreqDebias significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

Conclusion: FreqDebias effectively mitigates spectral bias in deepfake detectors through frequency domain debiasing, leading to improved generalization across unseen forgery types.

Abstract: Deepfake detectors often struggle to generalize to novel forgery types due to
biases learned from limited training data. In this paper, we identify a new
type of model bias in the frequency domain, termed spectral bias, where
detectors overly rely on specific frequency bands, restricting their ability to
generalize across unseen forgeries. To address this, we propose FreqDebias, a
frequency debiasing framework that mitigates spectral bias through two
complementary strategies. First, we introduce a novel Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup)
augmentation, which dynamically diversifies frequency characteristics of
training samples. Second, we incorporate a dual consistency regularization
(CR), which enforces both local consistency using class activation maps (CAMs)
and global consistency through a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a
hyperspherical embedding space. This dual CR mitigates over-reliance on certain
frequency components by promoting consistent representation learning under both
local and global supervision. Extensive experiments show that FreqDebias
significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

TL;DR: Labeling Copilot is an AI agent for automated computer vision data curation that combines calibrated discovery, controllable synthesis, and consensus annotation to efficiently create high-quality datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Curating high-quality domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data quality, diversity, and cost when dealing with large unlabeled data lakes.

Method: A central orchestrator agent powered by large multimodal language model uses multi-step reasoning to execute three specialized tools: Calibrated Discovery for sourcing relevant data, Controllable Synthesis for generating novel data, and Consensus Annotation for accurate labeling via multiple foundation models with novel consensus mechanism.

Result: Consensus Annotation achieved 14.2 candidate proposals per image on COCO (nearly double ground-truth), 37.1% mAP, discovered 903 new categories on Open Images. Calibrated Discovery was 40x more computationally efficient at 10-million sample scale with equivalent sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Agentic workflow with optimized, scalable tools provides robust foundation for curating industrial-scale datasets, proving effectiveness of Labeling Copilot's components in large-scale validation.

Abstract: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for
deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data
quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. We
introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for
computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal
language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across
three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,
in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis
generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)
Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple
foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum
suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of
Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object
discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per
image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation
mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class
imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability
to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a
10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x
more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample
efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized,
scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale
datasets.

*Song Fei,Tian Ye,Lujia Wang,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LucidFlux is a caption-free universal image restoration framework that adapts Flux.1 diffusion transformer without using image captions, achieving superior performance through strategic conditioning and modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current discriminative restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or drift when recovering images degraded by unknown mixtures while preserving semantics, especially in caption-free scenarios.

Method: Uses lightweight dual-branch conditioner to inject signals from degraded input and lightly restored proxy; timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule; caption-free semantic alignment via SigLIP features; scalable curation pipeline for structure-rich supervision.

Result: Consistently outperforms strong open-source and commercial baselines across synthetic and in-the-wild benchmarks; ablation studies verify necessity of each component.

Conclusion: For large DiTs, when, where, and what to condition on — rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts — is the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in the wild.

Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown
mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative
restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or
drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large
diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a
lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded
input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress
artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed
to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield
coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure
while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of
text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via
SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further
filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and
in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source
and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each
component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to
condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is
the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in
the wild.

TL;DR: DeeptraceReward is the first fine-grained benchmark for human-perceived deepfake traces in AI-generated videos, with 4.3K annotations across 3.3K videos. It trains multimodal language models to detect and localize fake artifacts, outperforming GPT-5 by 34.7% and revealing a difficulty gradient in detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generation models have advanced rapidly, but the critical question of whether humans can detect deepfake traces in generated videos has been largely overlooked. The research aims to understand human-perceived visual artifacts that reveal videos as machine-generated.

Method: Created DeeptraceReward dataset with 4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each annotation includes natural-language explanations, bounding-box regions, and precise timestamps. Consolidated annotations into 9 major categories of deepfake traces and trained multimodal language models as reward models to mimic human judgments.

Result: The 7B reward model outperformed GPT-5 by 34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation. Found consistent difficulty gradient: binary classification easiest, followed by natural language explanations, spatial grounding, and temporal labeling (hardest).

Conclusion: DeeptraceReward provides a rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video generation by foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, enabling better detection and understanding of AI-generated video artifacts.

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons?
While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension --
whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e.,
spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine
generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the
first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates
human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises
4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each
annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box
region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset
timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of
deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train
multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and
localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by
34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.
Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.
real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace
detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language
explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).
By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a
rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video
generation.

### [137] [Explaining multimodal LLMs via intra-modal token interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22415)
*Jiawei Liang,Ruoyu Chen,Xianghao Jiao,Siyuan Liang,Shiming Liu,Qunli Zhang,Zheng Hu,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes methods to improve interpretability of Multimodal Large Language Models by addressing intra-modal dependencies in both visual and textual modalities, overcoming limitations of existing cross-modal attribution approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretability research for MLLMs primarily focuses on cross-modal attribution but overlooks intra-modal dependencies, leading to fragmented visual explanations and spurious textual activations that compromise attribution fidelity.

Method: Two main methods: 1) Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation (MSEA) for visual branch - aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to adjust receptive fields dynamically; 2) Activation Ranking Correlation (ARC) for textual branch - measures relevance of contextual tokens via top-k prediction ranking alignment to suppress spurious activations.

Result: Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs and benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained explanations of model behavior.

Conclusion: The proposed intra-modal interaction enhancement significantly improves MLLM interpretability by producing more holistic visual explanations and suppressing spurious textual activations, leading to more faithful attribution of model decision-making processes.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making
mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research
has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image
regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these
approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality,
attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to
limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In
the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious
activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises
attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing
interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch,
we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which
aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive
fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For
the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC),
which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via
alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to
suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving
semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs
and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained
explanations of model behavior.

### [138] [CapRL: Stimulating Dense Image Caption Capabilities via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22647)
*Long Xing,Xiaoyi Dong,Yuhang Zang,Yuhang Cao,Jianze Liang,Qidong Huang,Jiaqi Wang,Feng Wu,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CapRL applies Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards to image captioning, using a vision-free LLM's question-answering accuracy as reward to train captioning models without expensive human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFT-based captioning models rely on expensive human annotations, leading to memorization and limited generalization. RLVR offers a scalable alternative but faces challenges in defining objective rewards for subjective caption quality.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: LVLM generates caption, vision-free LLM answers multiple-choice questions using caption only. Reward is based on LLM's accuracy, defining caption quality by its utility for downstream tasks.

Result: CapRL significantly improves performance across 12 benchmarks. Pretraining on CapRL-5M dataset achieves performance comparable to Qwen2.5-VL-72B and exceeds baseline by average 8.4% in Prism Framework evaluation.

Conclusion: CapRL successfully applies RLVR to subjective image captioning, demonstrating that caption utility (enabling accurate QA) is an effective reward metric, enabling scalable training without expensive annotations.

Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic
domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable
data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to
models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality
and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the
limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.
A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the
inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce
Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that
redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should
enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the
corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM
generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a
separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on
that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image
captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple
settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B
results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism
Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable
to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

*Bohan Huang,Qianyun Bao,Haoyuan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-MAN enhances U-Net with Progressive Attention-Guided Feature Fusion and Multi-scale Adaptive KAN modules to address semantic gaps and multi-scale feature extraction limitations in medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional U-Net architectures struggle with preserving fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to simple skip connections ignoring encoder-decoder semantic gaps and lack of multi-scale feature extraction in deep layers.

Method: Proposed U-MAN architecture with two modules: Progressive Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) replaces simple skip connections using attention to fuse encoder-decoder features, and Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN) enables adaptive multi-scale feature processing.

Result: Experiments on BUSI, GLAS, and CVC datasets show U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

Conclusion: U-MAN effectively addresses U-Net limitations through attention-based feature fusion and multi-scale processing, achieving superior medical image segmentation performance.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in preserving
fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to complex anatomical
structures and pathological regions. These challenges primarily stem from two
key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip
connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features,
and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep
layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale
Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive
Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN).
Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse
features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to
adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to
segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI,
GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

*Mishal Fatima,Shashank Agnihotri,Marius Bock,Kanchana Vaishnavi Gandikota,Kristof Van Laerhoven,Michael Moeller,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes γ-Quant, a method for learning task-specific non-linear quantization that enables pattern recognition using only 4-bit raw data while matching the performance of 12-bit data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pattern recognition models use pre-processed data optimized for human perception, but this is inefficient for automated analysis and energy-constrained devices. Low-bit-depth capture could save bandwidth and battery life.

Method: Proposes γ-Quant - task-specific learning of non-linear quantization for pattern recognition. Applied to raw-image object detection and human activity recognition from wearable sensor data.

Result: Raw data with learnable quantization using only 4-bits performs on par with raw 12-bit data in both computer vision and activity recognition tasks.

Conclusion: Task-specific quantization enables efficient pattern recognition with minimal bit-depth, making it suitable for low-bandwidth and energy-constrained applications.

Abstract: Most pattern recognition models are developed on pre-proce\-ssed data. In
computer vision, for instance, RGB images processed through image signal
processing (ISP) pipelines designed to cater to human perception are the most
frequent input to image analysis networks. However, many modern vision tasks
operate without a human in the loop, raising the question of whether such
pre-processing is optimal for automated analysis. Similarly, human activity
recognition (HAR) on body-worn sensor data commonly takes normalized
floating-point data arising from a high-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
as an input, despite such an approach being highly inefficient in terms of data
transmission, significantly affecting the battery life of wearable devices. In
this work, we target low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings where
sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture. We propose $\gamma$-Quant,
i.e.~the task-specific learning of a non-linear quantization for pattern
recognition. We exemplify our approach on raw-image object detection as well as
HAR of wearable data, and demonstrate that raw data with a learnable
quantization using as few as 4-bits can perform on par with the use of raw
12-bit data. All code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

### [141] [SSVIF: Self-Supervised Segmentation-Oriented Visible and Infrared Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22450)
*Zixian Zhao,Xingchen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SSVIF, a self-supervised framework for segmentation-oriented visible-infrared image fusion that eliminates the need for segmentation labels by leveraging cross-segmentation consistency between feature-level and pixel-level fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Application-oriented VIF methods require labeled datasets for downstream tasks, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming to acquire. This paper aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: Uses self-supervised learning with cross-segmentation consistency between feature-level and pixel-level fusion-based segmentation. Includes two-stage training strategy and dynamic weight adjustment for effective joint learning.

Result: SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised segmentation-oriented methods, despite being trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image pairs.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised framework effectively enables segmentation-oriented VIF without requiring segmentation labels, achieving competitive performance with supervised methods.

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in
recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation
and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional
VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus
solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF
methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused
images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However,
compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require
datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object
detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To
address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for
segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between
feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based
segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation
consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features
without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a
two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for
effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive
experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image
pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised
segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

*Chen Li,Meilong Xu,Xiaoling Hu,Weimin Lyu,Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes B\'ezier Meets Diffusion framework for cross-domain medical image generation using B\'ezier-curve style transfer and conditional diffusion models to improve domain adaptation and segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging modalities due to large domain gaps, overcoming limitations of GAN-based style transfer methods that struggle with high variability regions.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer to reduce domain gap and train robust segmentation model, 2) Conditional diffusion model trained with pseudo-labels and uncertainty-guided score matching to synthesize high-quality labeled target-domain images.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach generates realistic labeled images, significantly augments target domain data, and improves segmentation performance across domains.

Conclusion: The unified B\'ezier Meets Diffusion framework effectively addresses domain adaptation challenges in medical imaging through combined style transfer and diffusion-based generation with uncertainty handling.

Abstract: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging
modalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the
source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep
models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these
methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high
variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets
Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a
B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the
domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images
enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains.
Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the
target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize
high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy
pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method
that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images,
significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation
performance.

### [143] [PSTTS: A Plug-and-Play Token Selector for Efficient Event-based Spatio-temporal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22481)
*Xiangmo Zhao,Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSTTS is a plug-and-play module that reduces computational overhead in event-based vision by progressively selecting spatio-temporal tokens, achieving significant efficiency gains while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based methods convert event streams to frame sequences but neglect spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy, leading to computational inefficiency. Token sparsification methods for RGB videos are unreliable for event data due to intermediate token dependency and event noise.

Method: PSTTS has two stages: Spatial Token Purification (discards noise/non-event regions using spatio-temporal consistency) and Temporal Token Selection (removes redundant temporal information by evaluating motion pattern similarity between adjacent frames). It uses raw event data characteristics without additional parameters.

Result: Applied to four backbones on three datasets, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3% on DailyDVS-200 while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: PSTTS effectively addresses computational inefficiency in event-based vision through progressive token selection, achieving optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off without parameter overhead.

Abstract: Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods
typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event
frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high
spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame
sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token
sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token
representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them
ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for
event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the
spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to
effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an
optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists
of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial
Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the
spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent
interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token
Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event
frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We
apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba,
and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements.
Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3%
on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be
available.

### [144] [Group Critical-token Policy Optimization for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22485)
*Guohui Zhang,Hu Yu,Xiaoxiao Ma,JingHao Zhang,Yaning Pan,Mingde Yao,Jie Xiao,Linjiang Huang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GCPO is a method that identifies critical tokens in autoregressive visual generation and applies targeted policy optimization, achieving better performance than full-token optimization using only 30% of tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods apply uniform optimization across all image tokens, but different tokens contribute differently to training effectiveness. The key challenge is identifying and optimizing critical tokens during AR generation.

Method: GCPO identifies critical tokens from three perspectives: causal dependency (early tokens determine later ones), entropy-induced spatial structure (high entropy gradient tokens), and RLVR-focused token diversity (low visual similarity tokens). It then applies dynamic token-wise advantage weights based on confidence divergence between policy and reference models.

Result: GCPO achieves better performance than GRPO with full tokens while using only 30% of image tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple text-to-image benchmarks for AR models and unified multimodal models demonstrate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: GCPO successfully addresses the challenge of identifying and optimizing critical tokens in RLVR-based AR visual generation, providing more efficient and effective training through targeted token-wise optimization.

Abstract: Recent studies have extended Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) to autoregressive (AR) visual generation and achieved promising
progress. However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across
all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for
RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to
identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement
effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we
propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy
$\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy
optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based
AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal
dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final
image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced
spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image
structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused
token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled
images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified
critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to
encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model
and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves
better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal
models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EAGLE is a lightweight black-box framework that explains token generation in multimodal LLMs by attributing tokens to compact perceptual regions and quantifying language vs. perceptual influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack understanding of how generated tokens depend on visual modalities, limiting interpretability and reliability.

Method: EAGLE uses an objective function unifying sufficiency and indispensability scores, optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for efficient attribution, plus modality-aware analysis.

Result: EAGLE outperforms existing methods in faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis while requiring substantially less GPU memory across various open-source MLLMs.

Conclusion: EAGLE effectively advances MLLM interpretability through faithful and efficient token attribution to visual regions.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the
extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly
understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present
EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token
generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual
regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and
perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that
unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score),
optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and
efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs
modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing
fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across
open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in
faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring
substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and
practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs. The code is available

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities in vision-language models (VLMs) shows high accuracy on prototypical colors but significant drops on non-prototypical colors, with language model architecture being a key factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding whether VLMs name colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction, as color is a fundamental dimension of visual perception and communication.

Method: Replicated classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across five representative VLMs, with cross-linguistic analysis across nine languages and ablation studies.

Result: VLMs achieve high accuracy on prototypical colors but performance drops significantly on expanded non-prototypical sets. 21 common color terms consistently emerge across models, with two distinct approaches: constrained vs expansive models. Cross-linguistic analysis shows severe training imbalances favoring English and Chinese.

Conclusion: Language model architecture significantly influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities, revealing systematic biases and limitations in current VLMs' color understanding.

Abstract: Color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and a
primary means of communicating about objects and scenes. As vision-language
models (VLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding whether they name
colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction. We present
the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across VLMs,
replicating classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across
five representative models. Our results show that while VLMs achieve high
accuracy on prototypical colors from classical studies, performance drops
significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. We identify 21 common
color terms that consistently emerge across all models, revealing two distinct
approaches: constrained models using predominantly basic terms versus expansive
models employing systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis
across nine languages demonstrates severe training imbalances favoring English
and Chinese, with hue serving as the primary driver of color naming decisions.
Finally, ablation studies reveal that language model architecture significantly
influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art models with significantly reduced computational resources.

Conclusion: EfficientDepth successfully addresses the limitations of existing MDE methods by providing geometric consistency, fine details, robustness, and efficiency while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a pivotal role in various computer
vision applications, such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous
driving. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key
requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric
consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective

introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a
transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a
bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps.
We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as
well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE
method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve
training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and
fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a
loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth
maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance
comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with
significantly reduced computational resources.

TL;DR: HyCoVAD is a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines self-supervised learning for temporal analysis with LLM semantic validation to detect complex video anomalies involving multiple entities and temporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods struggle with semantic understanding of complex interactions, while LLMs lack fine-grained spatial localization and are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis.

Method: Uses multi-task SSL temporal analyzer (nnFormer backbone) to identify suspicious frames, then validates them with LLM using structured rule-based reasoning for semantic context.

Result: Achieves 72.5% frame-level AUC on ComplexVAD dataset, outperforming baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation.

Conclusion: HyCoVAD effectively bridges SSL's spatiotemporal modeling with LLM's semantic reasoning for complex anomaly detection, with released taxonomy and tools for future research.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a
significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events
defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple
entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often
struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large
language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are
computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained
spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly
Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal
analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone
which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with
multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of
anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the
analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to
validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD
dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming
existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our
interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to
facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

### [150] [Hierarchical Representation Matching for CLIP-based Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22645)
*Zhen-Hao Wen,Yan Wang,Ji Feng,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan,Da-Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERMAN introduces hierarchical representation matching for CLIP-based class-incremental learning, using LLMs to generate discriminative textual descriptors and matching them to different semantic hierarchy levels to improve discrimination and reduce forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLIP-based CIL approaches use simplistic templates like 'a photo of a [CLASS]' that ignore the hierarchical nature of visual concepts, and rely only on last-layer representations, missing hierarchical information from earlier layers.

Method: Leverages LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, matches them to different levels of semantic hierarchy, and adaptively routes them based on task requirements.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show the method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: HERMAN effectively addresses hierarchical concept recognition and catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning through hierarchical representation matching.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to
continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this
task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as
"a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual
concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained
cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details.
Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the
representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information
contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical
Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages
LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby
augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These
descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and
adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise
discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### [151] [JanusVLN: Decoupling Semantics and Spatiality with Dual Implicit Memory for Vision-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22548)
*Shuang Zeng,Dekang Qi,Xinyuan Chang,Feng Xiong,Shichao Xie,Xiaolong Wu,Shiyi Liang,Mu Xu,Xing Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JanusVLN is a novel Vision-and-Language Navigation framework that uses dual implicit neural memory to model spatial-geometric and visual-semantic information separately, avoiding computational redundancy and memory issues of explicit semantic memory methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN methods relying on explicit semantic memory suffer from spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which impede efficient navigation. The authors were inspired by human navigation's implicit scene representation.

Method: Proposes JanusVLN with dual implicit neural memory: spatial-geometric and visual-semantic memory as separate compact neural representations. Extends MLLM with 3D prior knowledge from spatial-geometric encoder, and uses historical key-value caches with sliding window for efficient incremental updates.

Result: Outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. Success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using multiple data types, and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB training data.

Conclusion: The dual implicit neural memory represents a novel paradigm that explores promising new directions for future VLN research, demonstrating superior efficiency and performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through
unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous
video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic
understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods
typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive
maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from
spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which
impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in
human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the
right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework
featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and
visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural
representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior
knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial
reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the
historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic
encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs
of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,
enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For
example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using
multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB
training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as
a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

### [152] [SpikeMatch: Semi-Supervised Learning with Temporal Dynamics of Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22581)
*Jini Yang,Beomseok Oh,Seungryong Kim,Sunok Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpikeMatch is the first semi-supervised learning framework for spiking neural networks (SNNs) that leverages temporal dynamics through leakage factors for pseudo-labeling in a co-training framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semi-supervised learning methods for SNNs remain underexplored compared to artificial neural networks, despite SNNs' biological plausibility and energy efficiency advantages.

Method: Uses temporal dynamics through SNN leakage factors for diverse pseudo-labeling in co-training framework; generates reliable pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on strongly-augmented ones.

Result: Outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: SpikeMatch effectively mitigates confirmation bias by capturing discriminative features with limited labels, demonstrating the viability of SSL for SNNs.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently been attracting significant
attention for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, but
semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods for SNN-based models remain
underexplored compared to those for artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this
paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages
the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse
pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among
multiple predictions from a single SNN, SpikeMatch generates reliable
pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on
strongly-augmented ones, effectively mitigating confirmation bias by capturing
discriminative features with limited labels. Experiments show that SpikeMatch
outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various
standard benchmarks.

### [153] [LongLive: Real-time Interactive Long Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22622)
*Shuai Yang,Wei Huang,Ruihang Chu,Yicheng Xiao,Yuyang Zhao,Xianbang Wang,Muyang Li,Enze Xie,Yingcong Chen,Yao Lu,Song Han,Yukang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongLive is an autoregressive framework for real-time long video generation that addresses efficiency and quality challenges through KV-recache mechanism, streaming long tuning, and frame sink attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video generation faces efficiency issues with diffusion models and quality degradation with causal AR models. Interactive capabilities for dynamic content creation add complexity in maintaining visual consistency during prompt transitions.

Method: Uses causal frame-level autoregressive design with KV-recache mechanism for prompt switching, streaming long tuning for long video training, and short window attention with frame sink for consistency and speed.

Result: Fine-tuned 1.3B-parameter model to minute-long generation in 32 GPU-days, achieves 20.7 FPS on H100 GPU, supports up to 240-second videos, and maintains strong VBench performance with INT8 quantization.

Conclusion: LongLive successfully enables efficient, high-quality long video generation with real-time interactive capabilities, overcoming key challenges in both training and inference for dynamic content creation.

Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for
real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents
challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing
models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to
bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for
faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory
challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based
generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are
critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in
real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,
especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt
transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level
AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states
with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable
long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);
and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as
frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.
With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model
to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains
20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both
short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single
H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal
quality loss.

*Ziyu Liu,Yuhang Zang,Shengyuan Ding,Yuhang Cao,Xiaoyi Dong,Haodong Duan,Dahua Lin,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARK is a synergistic framework that recycles rollouts and correctness data to simultaneously train both the policy and reward model, eliminating the need for separate reward models and costly human preference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high costs and potential reward-policy mismatch in RLHF, and the wasted supervision in RLVR by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each update.

Method: SPARK recycles rollouts and correctness data to train the model as a generative reward model using multiple objectives (pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses), creating a co-evolving feedback loop between policy and reward.

Result: SPARK achieves significant performance gains: SPARK-VL-7B shows 9.7% average gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks, 12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over baselines.

Conclusion: SPARK provides an efficient, on-policy, and stable framework that enables test-time scaling via self-reflection without external reward models, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization across multiple models and benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback
(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential
reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still
wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each
update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And
Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable
method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness
data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the
model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix
of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and
evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to
evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a
separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a
positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better
policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further
refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via
self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We
show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM
models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For
example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,
12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the
baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCNeXt is a novel self-supervised CNN architecture for depth estimation that outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs while being computationally efficient, achieving 10.18× speedup over current best models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth estimation is crucial for robotics, autonomous vehicles, and AR applications that operate under computational constraints. Stereo image pairs provide an effective solution, but ground-truth depth data is difficult to acquire across diverse scenarios, making self-supervised approaches valuable.

Method: Proposes CCNeXt architecture with modern CNN feature extractor, novel windowed epipolar cross-attention module in encoder, and comprehensive redesign of depth estimation decoder for self-supervised learning.

Result: Achieves competitive metrics on KITTI Eigen Split test data with 10.18× speedup over current best model, and state-of-the-art results in all metrics on KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and Driving Stereo datasets.

Conclusion: CCNeXt demonstrates superior performance and computational efficiency for self-supervised depth estimation, making it suitable for real-world applications with computational constraints.

Abstract: Depth Estimation plays a crucial role in recent applications in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. These scenarios commonly operate
under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an
effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the
disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified
system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data
across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution,
particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel
self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers
(ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture
employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar
cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign
of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt
achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being
10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art
results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and
Driving Stereo datasets when compared to recently proposed techniques. To

*Hongyu Chen,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UML-CoT is a structured reasoning framework that uses Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic chain-of-thought reasoning and executable action plans, outperforming traditional unstructured CoT in embodied tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Chain-of-Thought prompting relies on unstructured text, limiting interpretability and executability in embodied tasks. Existing structured CoTs using scene or logic graphs are limited to low-order relations and lack constructs for inheritance, behavioral abstraction, and standardized planning semantics.

Method: Proposes UML-CoT framework using UML class diagrams for compositional object semantics and activity diagrams for procedural control flow. Uses three-stage training pipeline with supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only data.

Result: Evaluated on MRoom-30k benchmark of cluttered room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success.

Conclusion: UML provides a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism compared to traditional unstructured CoT approaches for embodied tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

TL;DR: DIPSY is a training-free approach for few-shot image classification that uses IP-Adapter for image-to-image translation to generate discriminative synthetic images without model fine-tuning or external tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot image classification is challenging due to limited labeled data, and existing methods often require extensive fine-tuning or external information sources.

Method: Uses IP-Adapter for image-to-image translation with three innovations: extended classifier-free guidance for independent positive/negative conditioning, class similarity-based sampling for contrastive examples, and a simple pipeline without fine-tuning or external captioning/filtering.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance across ten benchmark datasets, particularly effective for fine-grained classification tasks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness of dual image prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative features without generative model adaptation or external tools.

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited
availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating
synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require
extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel
training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for
image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images
using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key
innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables
independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class
similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive
examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model
fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or
comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model
adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image
filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image
prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative
features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

*Amandeep Kumar,Nithin Gopalakrishnan Nair,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper shows that autoregressive transformers with Markovian attention masks are mathematically equivalent to discrete diffusion models, enabling integration of diffusion advantages like iterative refinement into VAR for improved efficiency and generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge autoregressive transformers and diffusion models by uncovering their mathematical equivalence, allowing VAR to benefit from diffusion techniques like iterative refinement while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Reinterpret VAR with Markovian attention masks as discrete diffusion (termed SRDD), enabling direct import of diffusion advantages such as iterative refinement and architectural optimizations into the VAR framework.

Result: The diffusion-based perspective of VAR leads to faster convergence, lower inference cost, improved zero-shot reconstruction, and consistent gains in efficiency and generation quality across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Establishing the mathematical equivalence between VAR with Markovian attention and discrete diffusion provides a principled bridge that enables combining the strengths of both approaches for superior visual generation performance.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency
and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale
prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated
remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,
we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a
Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete
diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with
Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR
transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how
one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative
refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster
convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.
Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR
leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method that uses diffusion transformer features and attention mechanisms for referring segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance without fine-tuning or architectural modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing referring segmentation methods require fine-tuning or multiple pre-trained models with additional training and architectural changes. Diffusion models contain rich semantic features that can be directly exploited for downstream tasks.

Method: Extracts features and attention scores from diffusion transformers without modifications. Uses stop words as attention magnets, identifies and handles global attention sinks (GAS), and implements attention redistribution strategy where stop words partition background activations into smaller clusters.

Result: Outperforms prior methods across zero-shot referring image and video segmentation benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art performance without fine-tuning or additional components.

Conclusion: Diffusion transformer features can be effectively leveraged for referring segmentation through attention analysis and redistribution strategies, achieving superior performance in a training-free framework.

Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance
only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at
the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile,
large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,
making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we
introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from
diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural
modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these
features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning
both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention
magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.
Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers
and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary
tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose
an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition
background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more
localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple
training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS
handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video
segmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods,
establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additional
components.

*Wenkai Wang,Vincent Lee,Yizhen Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A dual-model architecture with Projected Fusion and Differential Feature Learning identifies concentrated hallucination signals in sparse feature subsets, enabling efficient detection with minimal feature usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models hallucinate due to training data biases, but precise localization of hallucination signals in layers remains unclear, limiting efficient detection methods.

Method: Dual-model architecture with Projected Fusion block for adaptive inter-layer feature weighting and Differential Feature Learning mechanism comparing parallel encoders learning complementary representations.

Result: Achieved significant accuracy improvements on question answering and dialogue tasks; revealed hierarchical "funnel pattern" where shallow layers have high feature diversity and deep layers have concentrated usage; maintained performance with only 1% of feature dimensions.

Conclusion: Hallucination signals are more concentrated than previously assumed, offering a pathway to computationally efficient detection systems that reduce inference costs while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Large language model hallucination represents a critical challenge where
outputs deviate from factual accuracy due to distributional biases in training
data. While recent investigations establish that specific hidden layers exhibit
differences between hallucinatory and factual content, the precise localization
of hallucination signals within layers remains unclear, limiting the
development of efficient detection methods. We propose a dual-model
architecture integrating a Projected Fusion (PF) block for adaptive inter-layer
feature weighting and a Differential Feature Learning (DFL) mechanism that
identifies discriminative features by computing differences between parallel
encoders learning complementary representations from identical inputs. Through
systematic experiments across HaluEval's question answering, dialogue, and
summarization datasets, we demonstrate that hallucination signals concentrate
in highly sparse feature subsets, achieving significant accuracy improvements
on question answering and dialogue tasks. Notably, our analysis reveals a
hierarchical "funnel pattern" where shallow layers exhibit high feature
diversity while deep layers demonstrate concentrated usage, enabling detection
performance to be maintained with minimal degradation using only 1\% of feature
dimensions. These findings suggest that hallucination signals are more
concentrated than previously assumed, offering a pathway toward computationally
efficient detection systems that could reduce inference costs while maintaining
accuracy.

### [161] [Influence Guided Context Selection for Effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21359)
*Jiale Deng,Yanyan Shen,Ziyuan Pei,Youmin Chen,Linpeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Contextual Influence Value (CI value) to improve RAG by quantifying context quality through performance degradation when removing contexts, eliminating the need for complex hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG suffers from poor-quality retrieved contexts containing irrelevant or noisy information, and existing context selection methods show limited gains due to failure in holistically utilizing available information.

Method: Reconceptualizes context quality assessment as inference-time data valuation, introduces CI value metric, and develops a parameterized surrogate model with hierarchical architecture for CI value prediction during inference.

Result: Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and multiple LLMs show the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality contexts while preserving critical information.

Conclusion: The proposed CI value-based context selection method provides a comprehensive solution for improving RAG performance by better assessing context quality through integrated query-aware relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses large language model (LLM)
hallucinations by grounding responses in external knowledge, but its
effectiveness is compromised by poor-quality retrieved contexts containing
irrelevant or noisy information. While existing approaches attempt to improve
performance through context selection based on predefined context quality
assessment metrics, they show limited gains over standard RAG. We attribute
this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available
information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality
assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize
context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and
introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric
quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when
removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware
relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI
value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining
contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label
dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate
model for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a
hierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and
global inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision
and end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and
multiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality
contexts while preserving critical information. Code is available at

### [162] [Context Is What You Need: The Maximum Effective Context Window for Real World Limits of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21361)
*Norman Paulsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reveals that the maximum effective context window (MECW) of LLMs is drastically smaller than their advertised maximum context window (MCW), with models failing as early as 100 tokens and showing severe degradation by 1000 tokens, falling up to 99% short of their claimed capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the real-world effectiveness of LLM context windows, as providers boast large maximum context window sizes but their practical utility remains unclear.

Method: Defined maximum effective context window concept, formulated testing methods across various context sizes and problem types, and created standardized comparison metrics to identify failure points across multiple models.

Result: Found significant differences between reported MCW and actual MECW, with most models showing severe accuracy degradation by 1000 tokens and all models falling far short (up to 99%) of their advertised context windows. MECW also varies by problem type.

Conclusion: The maximum effective context window is much smaller than advertised and shifts based on problem type, providing actionable insights to improve model accuracy and reduce hallucinations.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) providers boast big numbers for maximum context
window sizes. To test the real world use of context windows, we 1) define a
concept of maximum effective context window, 2) formulate a testing method of a
context window's effectiveness over various sizes and problem types, and 3)
create a standardized way to compare model efficacy for increasingly larger
context window sizes to find the point of failure. We collected hundreds of
thousands of data points across several models and found significant
differences between reported Maximum Context Window (MCW) size and Maximum
Effective Context Window (MECW) size. Our findings show that the MECW is, not
only, drastically different from the MCW but also shifts based on the problem
type. A few top of the line models in our test group failed with as little as
100 tokens in context; most had severe degradation in accuracy by 1000 tokens
in context. All models fell far short of their Maximum Context Window by as
much as 99 percent. Our data reveals the Maximum Effective Context Window
shifts based on the type of problem provided, offering clear and actionable
insights into how to improve model accuracy and decrease model hallucination
rates.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI's future requires more than scaling; LLMs need human-crafted symbols as a compass to guide their intuition for genuine discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI development focuses heavily on scaling models, but this alone is insufficient for achieving genuine discovery. The motivation is to address the limitations of blind intuition in large language models by providing structured guidance.

Method: Proposes using human-crafted symbols as a compass to guide the powerful but blind intuition of large language models.

Result: The paper argues that this approach would unlock genuine discovery capabilities in AI systems beyond what scaling alone can achieve.

Conclusion: Human-crafted symbolic guidance is essential for large language models to move beyond mere scaling and achieve true discovery capabilities.

Abstract: We argue that AI's future requires more than scaling. To unlock genuine
discovery, large language models need a compass: human-crafted symbols to guide
their powerful but blind intuition.

*Sualeha Farid,Jayden Lin,Zean Chen,Shivani Kumar,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show inconsistent moral judgments across different languages, revealing cultural misalignment and calling for more culturally-aware AI development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how language mediates moral decision-making in LLMs and address concerns about their ability to generalize ethical judgments across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.

Method: Translate two established moral reasoning benchmarks into five culturally and typologically diverse languages for multilingual zero-shot evaluation, using carefully constructed research questions to analyze underlying drivers of moral judgment disparities.

Result: Revealed significant inconsistencies in LLMs' moral judgments across languages, often reflecting cultural misalignment, and identified various drivers including disagreements in reasoning strategies employed by LLMs.

Conclusion: Developed a structured typology of moral reasoning errors that highlights the need for more culturally-aware AI systems that can better handle moral reasoning across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual and
multicultural environments where moral reasoning is essential for generating
ethically appropriate responses. Yet, the dominant pretraining of LLMs on
English-language data raises critical concerns about their ability to
generalize judgments across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. In this
work, we systematically investigate how language mediates moral decision-making
in LLMs. We translate two established moral reasoning benchmarks into five
culturally and typologically diverse languages, enabling multilingual zero-shot
evaluation. Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in LLMs' moral
judgments across languages, often reflecting cultural misalignment. Through a
combination of carefully constructed research questions, we uncover the
underlying drivers of these disparities, ranging from disagreements to
reasoning strategies employed by LLMs. Finally, through a case study, we link
the role of pretraining data in shaping an LLM's moral compass. Through this
work, we distill our insights into a structured typology of moral reasoning
errors that calls for more culturally-aware AI.

*Gaurav Kumar Gupta,Nirajan Acharya,Pranal Pande*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-5 shows strong performance in diabetes diagnosis and management across five clinical scenarios when evaluated using synthetic cases aligned with ADA Standards of Care 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetes affects over half a billion adults worldwide with rising prevalence, but early recognition remains challenging due to vague symptoms, borderline lab values, gestational complexity, and long-term monitoring demands.

Method: Evaluated GPT-5 using a simulation framework built on synthetic cases aligned with ADA Standards of Care 2025, testing five scenarios: symptom recognition, laboratory interpretation, gestational diabetes screening, remote monitoring, and multimodal complication detection.

Result: GPT-5 showed strong alignment with ADA-defined criteria, successfully classifying cases, generating clinical rationales, producing patient explanations, and outputting structured JSON summaries.

Conclusion: GPT-5 may function as a dual-purpose tool for clinicians and patients, while underscoring the importance of reproducible evaluation frameworks for responsibly assessing LLMs in healthcare.

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a major global health challenge, affecting over half a
billion adults worldwide with prevalence projected to rise. Although the
American Diabetes Association (ADA) provides clear diagnostic thresholds, early
recognition remains difficult due to vague symptoms, borderline laboratory
values, gestational complexity, and the demands of long-term monitoring.
Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to enhance
decision support through structured, interpretable, and patient-friendly
outputs. This study evaluates GPT-5, the latest generative pre-trained
transformer, using a simulation framework built entirely on synthetic cases
aligned with ADA Standards of Care 2025 and inspired by public datasets
including NHANES, Pima Indians, EyePACS, and MIMIC-IV. Five representative
scenarios were tested: symptom recognition, laboratory interpretation,
gestational diabetes screening, remote monitoring, and multimodal complication
detection. For each, GPT-5 classified cases, generated clinical rationales,
produced patient explanations, and output structured JSON summaries. Results
showed strong alignment with ADA-defined criteria, suggesting GPT-5 may
function as a dual-purpose tool for clinicians and patients, while underscoring
the importance of reproducible evaluation frameworks for responsibly assessing
LLMs in healthcare.

*Guangliang Liu,Bocheng Chen,Xitong Zhang,Kristen Marie Johnson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the performance trade-off in moral alignment of language models, showing that downstream task degradation is primarily driven by overall forgetting levels rather than selective forgetting of stereotypes, and current fairness objectives fail to achieve effective trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why moral alignment through fine-tuning or model editing often degrades downstream task performance, particularly in the context of mitigating gender stereotypes, and to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this performance trade-off.

Method: Analyzed the mechanisms of performance trade-off through the lens of forgetting and fairness objectives, examining how selective forgetting of stereotypes affects overall forgetting levels and downstream task performance.

Result: Found that: (1) downstream task performance is primarily driven by overall forgetting level; (2) selective forgetting of stereotypes tends to increase overall forgetting; and (3) general solutions for mitigating forgetting are ineffective at reducing overall forgetting and fail to improve downstream task performance.

Conclusion: Current fairness objectives have limitations in achieving performance trade-offs in moral alignment, as they fail to effectively manage the relationship between selective stereotype forgetting and overall knowledge retention.

Abstract: Moral alignment has emerged as a widely adopted approach for regulating the
behavior of pretrained language models (PLMs), typically through fine-tuning or
model editing on curated datasets. However, this process often comes at the
cost of degraded downstream task performance. Prior studies commonly aim to
achieve a performance trade-off by encouraging PLMs to selectively forget
stereotypical knowledge through carefully designed fairness objectives, while
preserving their helpfulness. In this short paper, we investigate the
underlying mechanisms of the performance trade-off in the context of mitigating
gender stereotypes, through the lens of forgetting and the fairness objective.
Our analysis reveals the limitations of current fairness objective in achieving
trade-off by demonstrating that: (1) downstream task performance is primarily
driven by the overall forgetting level; (2) selective forgetting of stereotypes
tends to increase overall forgetting; and (3) general solutions for mitigating
forgetting are ineffective at reducing overall forgetting and fail to improve
downstream task performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a simple RL framework for enterprise reasoning tasks using verifiable rewards, achieving state-of-the-art results on the BIRD SQL generation benchmark without proprietary models or extra training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop custom reasoning models that can incorporate organization-specific knowledge for enterprise problems where reward functions are verifiable (RLVR setting).

Method: A general-purpose training recipe with careful prompt/model selection, warm-up using offline RL approach (TAO), followed by rigorous online RLVR training applied to SQL generation from natural language queries.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on BIRD benchmark: 73.56% without self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency, requiring fewer generations than the second-best approach.

Conclusion: The simple framework is broadly applicable to enterprise domains like business intelligence, data science, and coding, demonstrating the potential of RLVR for enterprise reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Developing custom reasoning models via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that can
incorporate organization-specific knowledge has great potential to address
problems faced by enterprise customers. In many of these problems, the reward
function is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We
apply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the
ability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to
SQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving
careful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL
approach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no
additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary
models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached
state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without
self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our
model also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD
is only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly
applicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science,
and coding.

### [168] [Learning to Reason with Mixture of Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21482)
*Adit Jain,Brendan Rappazzo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLVR methods for LLM reasoning discard distributional token information. Mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) addresses this by operating in continuous mixture space, achieving 5-35% gains on reasoning tasks with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods sample discrete tokens, discarding rich distributional information from the model's probability distributions over candidate tokens, unnecessarily constraining the reasoning search space.

Method: Propose mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in RLVR, creating a unified framework that extends RLVR to operate directly in continuous mixture space for chain-of-thought generation, including training-free methods using weighted sums of token embeddings.

Result: MoT-G methods achieve substantial improvements (5-35% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) on Reasoning-Gym compared to standard decoding, reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency.

Conclusion: MoT-G's benefits stem from maintaining higher hidden-state entropy throughout reasoning and promoting exploration in token space, demonstrating the value of preserving distributional information in RLVR approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a leading
approach for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Most
current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which
samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and
adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample
discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional
information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens.
While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven
beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily
constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To
address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in
RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G
approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture
embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate
directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought.
Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive
language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements
(5--35 \% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the
Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of
trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive
hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's
benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy
throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD) improves classification accuracy without throughput penalty by using a dual-head architecture with separate classification and reasoning heads, achieving significant speedup over Chain-of-Thought prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the trade-off between Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting's accuracy improvements and its significant throughput penalty due to rationale generation.

Method: Introduces DHRD with a pooled classification head for training/inference and a reasoning head supervised by teacher rationales used only in training, trained with weighted sum of label cross-entropy and token-level LM loss.

Result: Achieves 0.65-5.47% relative gains over pooled baselines on seven SuperGLUE tasks, with larger gains on entailment/causal tasks, and 96-142 times higher QPS than CoT decoding.

Conclusion: DHRD successfully improves classification accuracy while maintaining inference throughput comparable to pooled classifiers, eliminating the throughput penalty of CoT prompting.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting often improves classification accuracy, but
it introduces a significant throughput penalty with rationale generation (Wei
et al., 2022; Cheng and Van Durme, 2024). To resolve this trade-off, we
introduce Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD), a simple training method for
decoder-only language models (LMs) that adds (i) a pooled classification head
used during training and inference and (ii) a reasoning head supervised by
teacher rationales used only in training. We train with a loss function that is
a weighted sum of label cross-entropy and token-level LM loss over
input-plus-rationale sequences. On seven SuperGLUE tasks, DHRD yields relative
gains of 0.65-5.47% over pooled baselines, with notably larger gains on
entailment/causal tasks. Since we disable the reasoning head at test time,
inference throughput matches pooled classifiers and exceeds CoT decoding on the
same backbones by 96-142 times in QPS.

*Abdul Waheed,Zhen Wu,Carolyn Rosé,Daphne Ippolito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper systematically investigates which aspects of code data enhance LLM reasoning by testing structural vs semantic perturbations across 10 programming languages and finding LLMs are more vulnerable to structural changes, with pseudocode/flowcharts being equally effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand which specific properties of code data are responsible for enhancing large language models' reasoning capabilities, as it remains unclear what aspects of code contribute most to improved reasoning.

Method: Constructed parallel instruction datasets in 10 programming languages with controlled perturbations disrupting structural or semantic properties, then finetuned LLMs from 5 model families and 8 scales on each variant and evaluated on natural language, math, and code tasks.

Result: Across 3,331 experiments, LLMs were more vulnerable to structural than semantic perturbations, especially on math and code tasks. Pseudocode and flowcharts were as effective as code, and corrupted code with surface regularities remained competitive. Different languages showed task-specific gains.

Conclusion: Structural properties of code are crucial for LLM reasoning, appropriate abstractions can be equally effective, and syntactic styles influence task-specific performance, providing insights for designing training data to enhance LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Code data has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear which aspects of code are most
responsible. We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centric
framework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programming
languages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disrupt
structural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from five
model families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performance
on natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, our
results show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than
semantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractions
like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding the
same information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax can
often retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code with
misleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist.
Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoring
natural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rust
favoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight into
how different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design of
training data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: India's agro-based economy requires accessible agricultural information for optimal growth. Farmers need 24/7 access to farming-related queries.

Method: Built a chatbot using sentence embedding model with entity extraction and synonym elimination from Kisan Call Center dataset.

Result: Initial accuracy of 56% improved to 86% after optimizations. System handles weather, market rates, plant protection, and government schemes.

Conclusion: The chatbot enables easier farming information access, improves agricultural output, and reduces call center workload.

Abstract: India is an agro-based economy and proper information about agricultural
practices is the key to optimal agricultural growth and output. In order to
answer the queries of the farmer, we have build an agricultural chatbot based
on the dataset from Kisan Call Center. This system is robust enough to answer
queries related to weather, market rates, plant protection and government
schemes. This system is available 24* 7, can be accessed through any electronic
device and the information is delivered with the ease of understanding. The
system is based on a sentence embedding model which gives an accuracy of 56%.
After eliminating synonyms and incorporating entity extraction, the accuracy
jumps to 86%. With such a system, farmers can progress towards easier
information about farming related practices and hence a better agricultural
output. The job of the Call Center workforce would be made easier and the hard
work of various such workers can be redirected to a better goal.

TL;DR: Study examines domain effects in speaker diarization for African-accented English, finding consistent performance penalties for clinical speech across models due to short turns and frequent overlap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate domain-specific challenges in speaker diarization, particularly for African-accented English in clinical versus general dialogue settings, and understand the performance gap between domains.

Method: Evaluated multiple production and open systems on general and clinical dialogues using strict DER protocol with overlap scoring. Conducted error analysis and tested lightweight domain adaptation by fine-tuning segmentation module on accent-matched data.

Result: Consistent domain penalty observed for clinical speech across all models, primarily attributed to false alarms and missed detections. Domain adaptation reduced errors but did not eliminate the performance gap.

Conclusion: The study provides a controlled benchmark, error decomposition approach, and reproducible adaptation recipe. Recommends overlap-aware segmentation and balanced clinical resources as practical next steps to address domain challenges.

Abstract: This study examines domain effects in speaker diarization for
African-accented English. We evaluate multiple production and open systems on
general and clinical dialogues under a strict DER protocol that scores overlap.
A consistent domain penalty appears for clinical speech and remains significant
across models. Error analysis attributes much of this penalty to false alarms
and missed detections, aligning with short turns and frequent overlap. We test
lightweight domain adaptation by fine-tuning a segmentation module on
accent-matched data; it reduces error but does not eliminate the gap. Our
contributions include a controlled benchmark across domains, a concise approach
to error decomposition and conversation-level profiling, and an adaptation
recipe that is easy to reproduce. Results point to overlap-aware segmentation
and balanced clinical resources as practical next steps.

*Yash Saxena,Raviteja Bommireddy,Ankur Padia,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares two citation paradigms for LLMs in high-stakes domains: Generation-Time Citation (G-Cite) that produces answers and citations together, and Post-hoc Citation (P-Cite) that adds citations after drafting. The study finds a trade-off between coverage and correctness, with P-Cite achieving better coverage and G-Cite prioritizing precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need to cite verifiable sources in high-stakes domains like healthcare and law where errors have severe consequences. Practitioners need guidance on whether to generate citations during decoding or add them after drafting.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation from zero-shot to advanced retrieval-augmented methods across four attribution datasets, comparing G-Cite and P-Cite paradigms.

Result: P-Cite methods achieve high coverage with competitive correctness and moderate latency, while G-Cite methods prioritize precision at the cost of coverage and speed. Retrieval is the main driver of attribution quality in both paradigms.

Conclusion: Recommend retrieval-centric, P-Cite-first approach for high-stakes applications, reserving G-Cite for precision-critical settings like strict claim verification.

Abstract: Trustworthy Large Language Models (LLMs) must cite human-verifiable sources
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, academia, and finance, where
even small errors can have severe consequences. Practitioners and researchers
face a choice: let models generate citations during decoding, or let models
draft answers first and then attach appropriate citations. To clarify this
choice, we introduce two paradigms: Generation-Time Citation (G-Cite), which
produces the answer and citations in one pass, and Post-hoc Citation (P-Cite),
which adds or verifies citations after drafting. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation from zero-shot to advanced retrieval-augmented methods across four
popular attribution datasets and provide evidence-based recommendations that
weigh trade-offs across use cases. Our results show a consistent trade-off
between coverage and citation correctness, with retrieval as the main driver of
attribution quality in both paradigms. P-Cite methods achieve high coverage
with competitive correctness and moderate latency, whereas G-Cite methods
prioritize precision at the cost of coverage and speed. We recommend a
retrieval-centric, P-Cite-first approach for high-stakes applications,
reserving G-Cite for precision-critical settings such as strict claim
verification. Our codes and human evaluation results are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To meet individual user preferences for writing style and content focus in summaries by identifying fine-grained differences between users' preferences through comparison.

Method: ComPSum framework first generates structured analysis of users by comparing their preferences with other users' preferences, then uses this analysis to guide personalized summary generation.

Result: ComPSum outperforms strong baselines when evaluated using AuthorMap framework on the PerMSum dataset in review and news domains.

Conclusion: Comparing user preferences with others enables effective personalization in multi-document summarization, and the proposed evaluation framework provides robust assessment of personalized systems.

Abstract: Personalized multi-document summarization (MDS) is essential for meeting
individual user preferences of writing style and content focus for summaries.
In this paper, we propose that for effective personalization, it is important
to identify fine-grained differences between users' preferences by comparing
the given user's preferences with other users' preferences.Motivated by this,
we propose ComPSum, a personalized MDS framework. It first generates a
structured analysis of a user by comparing their preferences with other users'
preferences. The generated structured analysis is then used to guide the
generation of personalized summaries. To evaluate the performance of ComPSum,
we propose AuthorMap, a fine-grained reference-free evaluation framework for
personalized MDS. It evaluates the personalization of a system based on the
authorship attribution between two personalized summaries generated for
different users. For robust evaluation of personalized MDS, we construct
PerMSum, a personalized MDS dataset in the review and news domain. We evaluate
the performance of ComPSum on PerMSum using AuthorMap, showing that it
outperforms strong baselines.

TL;DR: VLMs can translate multimodal planning tasks into PDDL for formal solvers, outperforming end-to-end generation but struggling with vision aspects like capturing exhaustive object relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs handle simple multimodal planning but fail at long-horizon tasks requiring long action sequences. Text-only planning improved by using LLMs as formalizers rather than direct planners, but multimodal formalization research is scarce with oversimplifications.

Method: Developed five VLM-as-formalizer pipelines for one-shot, open-vocabulary multimodal PDDL formalization. Evaluated on existing benchmark and introduced two new benchmarks with authentic, multi-view, low-quality images. Used intermediate representations like captions and scene graphs.

Result: VLM-as-formalizer greatly outperforms end-to-end plan generation. Vision is the bottleneck - VLMs often fail to capture exhaustive object relations. Intermediate representations provide partial performance gains but with inconsistent benefits.

Conclusion: VLM-as-formalizer approach is promising for multimodal planning but vision capabilities remain limiting. Future research should focus on improving multimodal planning formalization, particularly in handling complex visual relationships.

Abstract: The advancement of vision language models (VLMs) has empowered embodied
agents to accomplish simple multimodal planning tasks, but not long-horizon
ones requiring long sequences of actions. In text-only simulations,
long-horizon planning has seen significant improvement brought by repositioning
the role of LLMs. Instead of directly generating action sequences, LLMs
translate the planning domain and problem into a formal planning language like
the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), which can call a formal solver
to derive the plan in a verifiable manner. In multimodal environments, research
on VLM-as-formalizer remains scarce, usually involving gross simplifications
such as predefined object vocabulary or overly similar few-shot examples. In
this work, we present a suite of five VLM-as-formalizer pipelines that tackle
one-shot, open-vocabulary, and multimodal PDDL formalization. We evaluate those
on an existing benchmark while presenting another two that for the first time
account for planning with authentic, multi-view, and low-quality images. We
conclude that VLM-as-formalizer greatly outperforms end-to-end plan generation.
We reveal the bottleneck to be vision rather than language, as VLMs often fail
to capture an exhaustive set of necessary object relations. While generating
intermediate, textual representations such as captions or scene graphs
partially compensate for the performance, their inconsistent gain leaves
headroom for future research directions on multimodal planning formalization.

*Madison Van Doren,Cory Holland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This pilot study evaluates multilingual AI models' ability to translate figurative language like idioms and puns across 24 regional dialects, finding that while grammatically correct, culturally nuanced translations require substantial human refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in existing LLM translation research that focuses on grammatical accuracy but overlooks cultural appropriateness and localization quality, which are critical for real-world applications like marketing and e-commerce.

Method: Evaluated 87 LLM-generated translations of e-commerce marketing emails across 24 regional dialects of 20 languages using human reviewers who provided quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on faithfulness to tone, meaning, and intended audience.

Result: Leading models produce grammatically correct translations but struggle with culturally nuanced language and figurative expressions, even for high-resource languages that top industry benchmarks. Cultural appropriateness emerged as a key area needing improvement.

Conclusion: Challenges the assumption that data volume predicts translation quality, introduces cultural appropriateness as a critical factor in multilingual LLM performance, and highlights the need for expanded research to inform reliable machine translation in culturally diverse contexts.

Abstract: This pilot study explores the localisation capabilities of state-of-the-art
multilingual AI models when translating figurative language, such as idioms and
puns, from English into a diverse range of global languages. It expands on
existing LLM translation research and industry benchmarks, which emphasise
grammatical accuracy and token-level correctness, by focusing on cultural
appropriateness and overall localisation quality - critical factors for
real-world applications like marketing and e-commerce.
  To investigate these challenges, this project evaluated a sample of 87
LLM-generated translations of e-commerce marketing emails across 24 regional
dialects of 20 languages. Human reviewers fluent in each target language
provided quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on faithfulness to the
original's tone, meaning, and intended audience. Findings suggest that, while
leading models generally produce grammatically correct translations, culturally
nuanced language remains a clear area for improvement, often requiring
substantial human refinement. Notably, even high-resource global languages,
despite topping industry benchmark leaderboards, frequently mistranslated
figurative expressions and wordplay.
  This work challenges the assumption that data volume is the most reliable
predictor of machine translation quality and introduces cultural
appropriateness as a key determinant of multilingual LLM performance - an area
currently underexplored in existing academic and industry benchmarks. As a
proof of concept, this pilot highlights limitations of current multilingual AI
systems for real-world localisation use cases. Results of this pilot support
the opportunity for expanded research at greater scale to deliver generalisable
insights and inform deployment of reliable machine translation workflows in
culturally diverse contexts.

### [178] [OjaKV: Context-Aware Online Low-Rank KV Cache Compression with Oja's Rule](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21623)
*Yuxuan Zhu,David H. Yang,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri,Keerthiram Murugesan,Tejaswini Pedapati,Pin-Yu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OjaKV is a KV-cache compression framework that combines hybrid storage (preserving first/recent tokens) with online subspace adaptation using Oja's algorithm, maintaining accuracy at high compression ratios without model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the memory bottleneck of KV-cache in long-context LLMs, where existing static compression methods fail under data distribution shifts.

Method: Hybrid storage policy preserves first and most recent tokens fully, while compressing intermediate tokens using online PCA via Oja's algorithm with comprehensive prefilling updates and lightweight decoding updates.

Result: Maintains or improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios, with strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks requiring complex reasoning.

Conclusion: OjaKV provides a practical plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient long-context inference that dynamically adapts to context shifts without model fine-tuning.

Abstract: The expanding long-context capabilities of large language models are
constrained by a significant memory bottleneck: the key-value (KV) cache
required for autoregressive generation. This bottleneck is substantial; for
instance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of
4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's
weights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising
direction, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that
performs poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid
storage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that
not all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial
first and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors
for attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies
low-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's
algorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a
comprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates
during decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving
context. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention
modules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or
even improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular,
OjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require
complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in
dynamically tracking context shifts. These results establish our hybrid
framework as a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient
long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning.

### [179] [Towards Transparent AI: A Survey on Explainable Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21631)
*Avash Palikhe,Zichong Wang,Zhipeng Yin,Rui Guo,Qiang Duan,Jie Yang,Wenbin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey provides a comprehensive review of explainable AI (XAI) techniques specifically for Language Models (LMs), organized by transformer architectures and evaluated through plausibility and faithfulness lenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The black-box nature of LMs raises critical interpretability concerns, especially for high-stakes applications, while existing XAI methods face limitations when applied to LMs due to their complex architectures and capabilities.

Method: The survey organizes XAI techniques according to transformer architectures (encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder), analyzes method adaptations for each architecture, and evaluates techniques through plausibility and faithfulness criteria.

Result: The review provides a structured analysis of XAI methods' strengths and limitations across different LM architectures, offering insights into their effectiveness for interpretability.

Conclusion: The survey identifies open research challenges and outlines future directions to guide development of robust, transparent, and interpretable XAI methods for Language Models.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing
and enabled remarkable progress across diverse domains, yet their black-box
nature raises critical concerns about the interpretability of their internal
mechanisms and decision-making processes. This lack of transparency is
particularly problematic for adoption in high-stakes domains, where
stakeholders need to understand the rationale behind model outputs to ensure
accountability. On the other hand, while explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) methods have been well studied for non-LMs, they face many limitations
when applied to LMs due to their complex architectures, considerable training
corpora, and broad generalization abilities. Although various surveys have
examined XAI in the context of LMs, they often fail to capture the distinct
challenges arising from the architectural diversity and evolving capabilities
of these models. To bridge this gap, this survey presents a comprehensive
review of XAI techniques with a particular emphasis on LMs, organizing them
according to their underlying transformer architectures: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder, and analyzing how methods are adapted to
each while assessing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore,
we evaluate these techniques through the dual lenses of plausibility and
faithfulness, offering a structured perspective on their effectiveness.
Finally, we identify open research challenges and outline promising future
directions, aiming to guide ongoing efforts toward the development of robust,
transparent, and interpretable XAI methods for LMs.

### [180] [ReviewScore: Misinformed Peer Review Detection with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21679)
*Hyun Ryu,Doohyuk Jang,Hyemin S. Lee,Joonhyun Jeong,Gyeongman Kim,Donghyeon Cho,Gyouk Chu,Minyeong Hwang,Hyeongwon Jang,Changhun Kim,Haechan Kim,Jina Kim,Joowon Kim,Yoonjeon Kim,Kwanhyung Lee,Chanjae Park,Heecheol Yun,Gregor Betz,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReviewScore to detect misinformed peer reviews in AI conferences, defining misinformed points as weaknesses with incorrect premises or questions already answered in the paper. An automated engine reconstructs premises from weaknesses, and LLMs show moderate agreement with human experts in evaluating ReviewScore.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Peer review quality is degrading in AI conferences due to exploding submission numbers, creating a need to reliably detect low-quality reviews with misinformed content.

Method: Define misinformed review points, develop ReviewScore metric, create automated premise reconstruction engine, build human-annotated dataset, and evaluate LLM performance on ReviewScore assessment.

Result: 15.2% of weaknesses and 26.4% of questions are misinformed. LLMs show moderate agreement with human experts, with premise-level factuality evaluation achieving significantly higher agreement than weakness-level evaluation.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for automated detection of misinformed reviews, with premise-level analysis being more reliable than weakness-level assessment for automated evaluation.

Abstract: Peer review serves as a backbone of academic research, but in most AI
conferences, the review quality is degrading as the number of submissions
explodes. To reliably detect low-quality reviews, we define misinformed review
points as either "weaknesses" in a review that contain incorrect premises, or
"questions" in a review that can be already answered by the paper. We verify
that 15.2% of weaknesses and 26.4% of questions are misinformed and introduce
ReviewScore indicating if a review point is misinformed. To evaluate the
factuality of each premise of weaknesses, we propose an automated engine that
reconstructs every explicit and implicit premise from a weakness. We build a
human expert-annotated ReviewScore dataset to check the ability of LLMs to
automate ReviewScore evaluation. Then, we measure human-model agreements on
ReviewScore using eight current state-of-the-art LLMs and verify moderate
agreements. We also prove that evaluating premise-level factuality shows
significantly higher agreements than evaluating weakness-level factuality. A
thorough disagreement analysis further supports a potential of fully automated
ReviewScore evaluation.

TL;DR: GRAB is a finance-specific benchmark for evaluating unsupervised topic models on 10-K risk disclosures, featuring 1.61M sentences with automatically generated labels using FinBERT, YAKE, and taxonomy matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No public benchmark exists to evaluate unsupervised topic models for risk categorization in 10-K risk disclosures, which is important for oversight and investment analysis.

Method: Created GRAB benchmark with 1.61M sentences from 8,247 filings using automated labeling combining FinBERT token attention, YAKE keyphrase signals, and taxonomy-aware collocation matching anchored in a 193-term taxonomy mapped to 21 fine-grained risk types.

Conclusion: GRAB enables reproducible, standardized evaluation of various topic models on financial disclosures, providing dataset, labels, and code for the research community.

Abstract: Risk categorization in 10-K risk disclosures matters for oversight and
investment, yet no public benchmark evaluates unsupervised topic models for
this task. We present GRAB, a finance-specific benchmark with 1.61M sentences
from 8,247 filings and span-grounded sentence labels produced without manual
annotation by combining FinBERT token attention, YAKE keyphrase signals, and
taxonomy-aware collocation matching. Labels are anchored in a risk taxonomy
mapping 193 terms to 21 fine-grained types nested under five macro classes; the
21 types guide weak supervision, while evaluation is reported at the macro
level. GRAB unifies evaluation with fixed dataset splits and robust
metrics--Accuracy, Macro-F1, Topic BERTScore, and the entropy-based Effective
Number of Topics. The dataset, labels, and code enable reproducible,
standardized comparison across classical, embedding-based, neural, and hybrid
topic models on financial disclosures.

### [182] [Think-on-Graph 3.0: Efficient and Adaptive LLM Reasoning on Heterogeneous Graphs via Multi-Agent Dual-Evolving Context Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21710)
*Xiaojun Wu,Cehao Yang,Xueyuan Lin,Chengjin Xu,Xuhui Jiang,Yuanliang Sun,Hui Xiong,Jia Li,Jian Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToG-3 introduces a multi-agent framework with dynamic graph construction and dual-evolution mechanism to overcome limitations of static graph-based RAG methods, enabling precise reasoning with lightweight LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based RAG methods face fundamental trade-offs: manual graph construction is expensive to scale, while automatic extraction is limited by LLM performance, especially with smaller models. Static graph indexes don't adapt to actual queries.

Method: Proposes Think-on-Graph 3.0 with Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism. Uses a multi-agent system (Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, Responser) to dynamically build and refine a Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index through iterative dual-evolution of query and sub-graph.

Result: Extensive experiments show ToG-3 outperforms baselines on both deep and broad reasoning benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of MACER framework components.

Conclusion: The dual-evolving multi-agent system enables adaptive graph index construction during reasoning, overcoming static graph limitations and enabling precise reasoning even with lightweight LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph-based RAG has become the
important paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external
knowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While
graph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,
they face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge
graphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted
graphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM
extractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper
presents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces
Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these
limitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of
a Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly
incorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving
Sub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical
limitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static
graph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A
multi-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser
agents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,
answer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and
subgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively
build a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent
drawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise
reasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning
benchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of
MACER framework.

*Jiho Kim,Junseong Choi,Woosog Chay,Daeun Kyung,Yeonsu Kwon,Yohan Jo,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProPerSim is a new task and simulation framework for developing proactive, personalized AI assistants that learn from user feedback in home scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing demand for AI assistants that are both proactive and personalized, but the combination of these two capabilities remains underexplored in current LLM research.

Method: ProPerSim framework with user agents having rich personas that provide ratings on suggestions, and ProPerAssistant - a retrieval-augmented, preference-aligned assistant that continually learns through user feedback.

Result: Experiments across 32 diverse personas show that ProPerAssistant adapts its strategy and steadily improves user satisfaction over time.

Conclusion: The framework successfully demonstrates the promise of uniting proactivity and personalization in AI assistants, enabling them to make timely, personalized recommendations that adapt to user preferences.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily
life, there is growing demand for AI assistants that are not only reactive but
also proactive and personalized. While recent advances have pushed forward
proactivity and personalization individually, their combination remains
underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProPerSim, a new task and
simulation framework for developing assistants capable of making timely,
personalized recommendations in realistic home scenarios. In our simulation
environment, a user agent with a rich persona interacts with the assistant,
providing ratings on how well each suggestion aligns with its preferences and
context. The assistant's goal is to use these ratings to learn and adapt to
achieve higher scores over time. Built on ProPerSim, we propose
ProPerAssistant, a retrieval-augmented, preference-aligned assistant that
continually learns and adapts through user feedback. Experiments across 32
diverse personas show that ProPerAssistant adapts its strategy and steadily
improves user satisfaction, highlighting the promise of uniting proactivity and
personalization.

*Xiliang Zhu,Shi Zong,David Rossouw*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuned public LLMs with up to 8B parameters can surpass GPT-4o in accuracy for multi-question answering over lengthy contexts, offering cost-effective deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs for QA over lengthy contexts faces high computational costs and latency challenges, especially when answering multiple questions from the same context in industrial settings.

Method: Conducted extensive experiments benchmarking both proprietary and public LLMs on multi-question answering tasks using the same conversational context.

Result: While proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o achieve best overall performance, fine-tuned public LLMs (up to 8B parameters) can exceed GPT-4o's accuracy.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned public LLMs demonstrate potential for transparent and cost-effective deployment in real-world applications, offering competitive accuracy with lower computational requirements.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering (QA) over
lengthy contexts is a significant challenge. In industrial settings, this
process is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, especially
when multiple questions must be answered based on the same context. In this
work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to answer multiple questions based on
the same conversational context. We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark
a range of both proprietary and public models on this challenging task. Our
findings highlight that while strong proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o achieve the
best overall performance, fine-tuned public LLMs with up to 8 billion
parameters can surpass GPT-4o in accuracy, which demonstrates their potential
for transparent and cost-effective deployment in real-world applications.

### [185] [Self-Speculative Biased Decoding for Faster Live Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21740)
*Linxiao Zeng,Haoyun Deng,Kangyuan Shu,Shizhen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-Speculative Biased Decoding enables efficient streaming translation by reusing recent outputs as drafts and biasing verification towards them, achieving 1.7x speedup and 80% flicker reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with streaming applications like live translation due to computational costs and latency requirements when repeatedly generating outputs for growing input streams.

Method: Proposes using most recent output as draft for growing input context, with biased verification towards draft tokens for higher acceptance rates, eliminating separate draft computations.

Result: Achieves 1.7x speedup compared to conventional auto-regressive re-translation without quality loss, and reduces flickering by 80% using display-only mask-k technique.

Conclusion: The approach provides a model-agnostic, plug-and-play solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications without requiring draft computations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in various text generation tasks. However, it remains challenging
to use them off-the-shelf in streaming applications (such as live translation),
where the output must continually update as the input context expands, while
still maintaining a reasonable computational cost to meet the latency
requirement.
  In this work, we reexamine the re-translation approach to simultaneous
translation and propose Self-Speculative Biased Decoding, a novel inference
paradigm designed to avoid repeatedly generating output from scratch for a
consistently growing input stream. We propose using the most recent output as a
draft for the current growing input context. During the verification stage, the
output will be biased towards the draft token for a higher draft acceptance
rate. This strategy not only minimizes flickering that might distract users but
also leads to higher speedups. Conventional decoding may take charge from the
point of divergence after draft verification and continue until the end
condition is met.
  Unlike existing speculative decoding strategies, our approach eliminates the
need for draft computations, making it a model-agnostic and plug-and-play
solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications.
Experimental results on simultaneous text-to-text re-translation demonstrate
that our approach achieves up to 1.7x speedup compared to conventional
auto-regressive re-translation without compromising quality. Additionally, it
significantly reduces flickering by 80% by incorporating the display-only
mask-k technique.

### [186] [Thinking with Sound: Audio Chain-of-Thought Enables Multimodal Reasoning in Large Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21749)
*Zhen Xiong,Yujun Cai,Zhecheng Li,Junsong Yuan,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Thinking-with-Sound (TwS) framework enhances Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) by enabling audio reasoning through numerical analysis and digital manipulation, significantly improving robustness on challenging acoustic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LALMs perform well on basic audio understanding tasks but struggle with complex acoustic scenarios that require audio-domain analysis tools like noise suppression and source separation. They lack the ability to actively reason with audio signals.

Method: TwS framework combines linguistic reasoning with on-the-fly audio-domain analysis through multimodal reasoning. It enables models to perform numerical analysis and digital manipulation of audio signals, treating audio as dynamic rather than static input.

Result: On the MELD-Hard1k benchmark with acoustic perturbations, TwS achieved substantial robustness improvements: small models gained 24.73% absolute accuracy, with improvements scaling up to 36.61% for larger models. State-of-the-art LALMs suffered over 50% performance degradation on the same benchmark.

Conclusion: Audio CoT (Chain of Thought) can significantly enhance robustness without retraining, opening new directions for developing more robust audio understanding systems by enabling active thinking with sound.

Abstract: Recent Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have shown strong performance on
various audio understanding tasks such as speech translation and Audio Q\&A.
However, they exhibit significant limitations on challenging audio reasoning
tasks in complex acoustic scenarios. These situations would greatly benefit
from the use of acoustic tools like noise suppression, source separation, and
precise temporal alignment, but current LALMs lack access to such tools. To
address this limitation, we introduce Thinking-with-Sound (TwS), a framework
that equips LALMs with Audio CoT by combining linguistic reasoning with
on-the-fly audio-domain analysis. Unlike existing approaches that treat audio
as static input, TwS enables models to actively think with audio signals,
performing numerical analysis and digital manipulation through multimodal
reasoning. To evaluate this approach, we construct MELD-Hard1k, a new
robustness benchmark created by introducing various acoustic perturbations.
Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LALMs suffer dramatic performance
degradation on MELD-Hard1k, with accuracy dropping by more than $50\%$ compared
to clean audio. TwS achieves substantial improvements in robustness,
demonstrating both effectiveness and scalability: small models gain $24.73\%$
absolute accuracy, with improvements scaling consistently up to $36.61\%$ for
larger models. Our findings demonstrate that Audio CoT can significantly
enhance robustness without retraining, opening new directions for developing
more robust audio understanding systems.

TL;DR: SynerGen is a unified generative recommender model that bridges personalized search and recommendation using a single backbone, excelling at both retrieval and ranking tasks through joint optimization and novel time-aware positional embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address mis-calibration and engineering overhead in traditional retrieve-then-rank pipelines, and overcome performance trade-offs in existing generative models that typically handle either personalized search or query-free recommendation separately.

Method: Uses a decoder-only Transformer trained on behavioral sequences with joint optimization: InfoNCE for retrieval and hybrid pointwise-pairwise loss for ranking. Introduces novel time-aware rotary positional embedding to incorporate time information into attention mechanism.

Result: Achieves significant improvements on widely adopted recommendation and search benchmarks compared to strong generative recommender and joint search and recommendation baselines.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of a single generative foundation model for industrial-scale unified information access, allowing semantic signals from search to improve recommendation and vice versa.

Abstract: The dominant retrieve-then-rank pipeline in large-scale recommender systems
suffers from mis-calibration and engineering overhead due to its architectural
split and differing optimization objectives. While recent generative sequence
models have shown promise in unifying retrieval and ranking by
auto-regressively generating ranked items, existing solutions typically address
either personalized search or query-free recommendation, often exhibiting
performance trade-offs when attempting to unify both. We introduce
\textit{SynerGen}, a novel generative recommender model that bridges this
critical gap by providing a single generative backbone for both personalized
search and recommendation, while simultaneously excelling at retrieval and
ranking tasks. Trained on behavioral sequences, our decoder-only Transformer
leverages joint optimization with InfoNCE for retrieval and a hybrid
pointwise-pairwise loss for ranking, allowing semantic signals from search to
improve recommendation and vice versa. We also propose a novel time-aware
rotary positional embedding to effectively incorporate time information into
the attention mechanism. \textit{SynerGen} achieves significant improvements on
widely adopted recommendation and search benchmarks compared to strong
generative recommender and joint search and recommendation baselines. This work
demonstrates the viability of a single generative foundation model for
industrial-scale unified information access.

*Han Yuan,Yue Zhao,Li Zhang,Wuqiong Luo,Zheng Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Causal analysis reveals structured output has minimal causal impact on LLM generation quality, contradicting prior conflicting findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resolve conflicting prior studies about structured output's effects on LLM generation quality using rigorous causal inference methods.

Method: Used causal inference with five potential causal structures across seven public and one developed reasoning tasks on GPT-4o.

Result: Coarse metrics show mixed effects, but causal analysis finds no causal impact in 43/48 scenarios; only 5 show effects, mostly from instruction influence.

Conclusion: Structured output has minimal causal effect on LLM generation; apparent effects in prior studies likely stem from methodological limitations.

Abstract: Structured output from large language models (LLMs) has enhanced efficiency
in processing generated information and is increasingly adopted in industrial
applications. Prior studies have investigated the impact of structured output
on LLMs' generation quality, often presenting one-way findings. Some suggest
that structured format enhances completeness and factual accuracy, while others
argue that it restricts the reasoning capacity of LLMs and leads to reductions
in standard evaluation metrics. Potential limitations of these assessments
include restricted testing scenarios, weakly controlled comparative settings,
and reliance on coarse metrics. In this work, we present a refined analysis
using causal inference. Based on one assumed and two guaranteed constraints, we
derive five potential causal structures characterizing the influence of
structured output on LLMs' generation: (1) collider without m-bias, (2)
collider with m-bias, (3) single cause from instruction, (4) single cause from
output format, and (5) independence. Across seven public and one developed
reasoning tasks, we find that coarse metrics report positive, negative, or
neutral effects of structured output on GPT-4o's generation. However, causal
inference reveals no causal impact in 43 out of 48 scenarios. In the remaining
5, 3 involve multifaceted causal structures influenced by concrete
instructions.

*Hongbin Zhang,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Yang Xiang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARB is a cultural awareness benchmark for evaluating reward models across 10 cultures and 4 domains, revealing deficiencies in current RMs and proposing Think-as-Locals with RLVR to improve cultural understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward model evaluations lack culturally relevant datasets, making it difficult to assess cultural awareness which is crucial for global alignment of LLMs.

Method: Proposed CARB benchmark covering 10 cultures across 4 domains, and Think-as-Locals approach using reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit deeper cultural reasoning.

Result: Evaluation revealed RMs' deficiencies in cultural awareness modeling and positive correlation between CARB performance and downstream multilingual cultural alignment. Think-as-Locals effectively mitigated spurious feature interference.

Conclusion: CARB enables better evaluation of cultural awareness in RMs, and Think-as-Locals with RLVR advances culture-aware reward modeling by reducing reliance on surface-level features.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with diverse cultures. Consequently, evaluating their cultural awareness is
essential for further advancing global alignment of LLMs. However, existing RM
evaluations fall short in assessing cultural awareness due to the scarcity of
culturally relevant evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we propose Cultural
Awareness Reward modeling Benchmark (CARB), covering 10 distinct cultures
across 4 cultural domains. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art RMs
reveals their deficiencies in modeling cultural awareness and demonstrates a
positive correlation between performance on CARB and downstream multilingual
cultural alignment tasks. Further analysis identifies the spurious correlations
within culture-aware reward modeling, wherein RM's scoring relies predominantly
on surface-level features rather than authentic cultural nuance understanding.
To address these, we propose Think-as-Locals to elicit deeper culturally
grounded reasoning from generative RMs via reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards (RLVR) and employ well-designed rewards to ensure accurate
preference judgments and high-quality structured evaluation criteria
generation. Experimental results validate its efficacy in mitigating spurious
features interference and advancing culture-aware reward modeling.

*Qianen Zhang,Satoshi Nakamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Extends SiMT action space with adaptive actions (SENTENCE_CUT, DROP, PARTIAL_SUMMARIZATION, PRONOMINALIZATION) in decoder-only LLM framework, improving translation quality and reducing latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional encoder-decoder policies with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address the real-time constraints and quality requirements of Simultaneous Machine Translation.

Method: Implemented adaptive actions in decoder-only LLM framework with action-aware prompting for training, and developed latency-aware TTS pipeline for evaluation.

Result: Consistently improved semantic metrics (COMET-KIWI) and achieved lower delay (Average Lagging) on ACL60/60 benchmarks; DROP + SENTENCE_CUT combination provided best balance between fluency and latency.

Conclusion: Enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.

Abstract: Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) requires high-quality translations
under strict real-time constraints, which traditional encoder-decoder policies
with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address. We extend the action space
of SiMT with four adaptive actions: SENTENCE_CUT, DROP, PARTIAL_SUMMARIZATION
and PRONOMINALIZATION, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and
simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We implement these actions
in a decoder-only large language model (LLM) framework and construct training
references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and
latency, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual
outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60
English-Chinese and English-German benchmarks show that our framework
consistently improves semantic metrics (e.g., COMET-KIWI) and achieves lower
delay (measured by Average Lagging) compared to reference translations and
salami-based baselines. Notably, combining DROP and SENTENCE_CUT yields the
best overall balance between fluency and latency. These results demonstrate
that enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising
direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.

### [191] [Towards Minimal Causal Representations for Human Multimodal Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21805)
*Menghua Jiang,Yuncheng Jiang,Haifeng Hu,Sijie Mai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CaMIB, a causal multimodal information bottleneck model that improves out-of-distribution generalization by disentangling causal features from dataset biases using information bottleneck and causal principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal learning methods are vulnerable to dataset biases, causing models to conflate statistical shortcuts with genuine causal features, leading to poor out-of-distribution generalization.

Method: Uses information bottleneck to filter unimodal inputs, then disentangles multimodal representations into causal and shortcut subrepresentations using parameterized masks, with instrumental variable constraints and backdoor adjustment for stable causal estimation.

Result: Extensive experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis, humor detection, and sarcasm detection with OOD test sets demonstrate effectiveness, with theoretical and empirical analyses showing interpretability and soundness.

Conclusion: CaMIB effectively addresses dataset bias issues in multimodal learning by leveraging causal principles rather than traditional likelihood, improving OOD generalization while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: Human Multimodal Language Understanding (MLU) aims to infer human intentions
by integrating related cues from heterogeneous modalities. Existing works
predominantly follow a ``learning to attend" paradigm, which maximizes mutual
information between data and labels to enhance predictive performance. However,
such methods are vulnerable to unintended dataset biases, causing models to
conflate statistical shortcuts with genuine causal features and resulting in
degraded out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. To alleviate this issue, we
introduce a Causal Multimodal Information Bottleneck (CaMIB) model that
leverages causal principles rather than traditional likelihood. Concretely, we
first applies the information bottleneck to filter unimodal inputs, removing
task-irrelevant noise. A parameterized mask generator then disentangles the
fused multimodal representation into causal and shortcut subrepresentations. To
ensure global consistency of causal features, we incorporate an instrumental
variable constraint, and further adopt backdoor adjustment by randomly
recombining causal and shortcut features to stabilize causal estimation.
Extensive experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis, humor detection, and
sarcasm detection, along with OOD test sets, demonstrate the effectiveness of
CaMIB. Theoretical and empirical analyses further highlight its
interpretability and soundness.

### [192] [Can LLMs Solve and Generate Linguistic Olympiad Puzzles?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21820)
*Neh Majmudar,Elena Filatova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs outperform humans on most linguistic puzzle types except writing systems and understudied languages, and can be used to generate puzzles to promote linguistics education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' capabilities in solving linguistic puzzles and use insights to automate puzzle generation for promoting linguistics education and rare language awareness.

Method: Extended existing benchmark for linguistic puzzle solving, tested various LLMs including OpenAI's o1 on different linguistic topics, then applied insights to puzzle generation task.

Result: LLMs demonstrated superior performance over humans on most puzzle types except those involving writing systems and understudied languages.

Conclusion: Automated puzzle generation can expand interest in linguistics and support dissemination of knowledge about rare languages, making it an important research task.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a combination of novel and exciting tasks: the
solution and generation of linguistic puzzles. We focus on puzzles used in
Linguistic Olympiads for high school students. We first extend the existing
benchmark for the task of solving linguistic puzzles. We explore the use of
Large Language Models (LLMs), including recent state-of-the-art models such as
OpenAI's o1, for solving linguistic puzzles, analyzing their performance across
various linguistic topics. We demonstrate that LLMs outperform humans on most
puzzles types, except for those centered on writing systems, and for the
understudied languages. We use the insights from puzzle-solving experiments to
direct the novel task of puzzle generation. We believe that automating puzzle
generation, even for relatively simple puzzles, holds promise for expanding
interest in linguistics and introducing the field to a broader audience. This
finding highlights the importance of linguistic puzzle generation as a research
task: such puzzles can not only promote linguistics but also support the
dissemination of knowledge about rare and understudied languages.

### [193] [ResT: Reshaping Token-Level Policy Gradients for Tool-Use Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21826)
*Zihan Lin,Xiaohan Wang,Jie Cao,Jiajun Chai,Guojun Yin,Wei Lin,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ResT is a novel method that reshapes policy gradients through entropy-informed token reweighting to improve training efficiency and stability in LLM tool-use tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for LLM tool-use rely solely on sparse outcome rewards and ignore task particularities, leading to high policy-gradient variance and inefficient training. The paper aims to address these challenges by establishing a theoretical link between policy entropy and training stability.

Method: Proposed ResT (Reshaped Token-level policy gradients) that reshapes policy gradient through entropy-informed token reweighting. It progressively upweights reasoning tokens during training, enabling a smooth transition from structural correctness to semantic reasoning.

Result: ResT achieves state-of-the-art results on BFCL and API-Bank benchmarks, outperforming prior methods by up to 8.76%. When fine-tuned on a 4B base LLM, it surpasses GPT-4o by 4.11% on single-turn tasks and 1.50% on multi-turn base tasks.

Conclusion: The entropy-aware token reweighting scheme in ResT effectively stabilizes convergence in multi-turn tool-use tasks and enables more efficient training of LLM agents for tool-use applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) transcend passive generation and act as
goal-directed agents by invoking external tools. Reinforcement learning (RL)
offers a principled framework for optimizing these emergent tool-use policies,
yet the prevailing paradigm relies exclusively on sparse outcome rewards and
lacks consideration of the particularity of tool-use tasks, inflating
policy-gradient variance and resulting in inefficient training. To better
understand and address these challenges, we first establish a theoretical link
between policy entropy and training stability of tool-use tasks, which reveals
that structured, low-entropy tokens are primary determinants of rewards.
Motivated by this insight, we propose \textbf{Res}haped \textbf{T}oken-level
policy gradients (\textbf{ResT}) for tool-use tasks. ResT reshapes the policy
gradient through entropy-informed token reweighting, progressively upweighting
reasoning tokens as training proceeds. This entropy-aware scheme enables a
smooth shift from structural correctness to semantic reasoning and stabilizes
convergence in multi-turn tool-use tasks. Evaluation on BFCL and API-Bank shows
that ResT achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming prior methods by up
to $8.76\%$. When fine-tuned on a 4B base LLM, ResT further surpasses GPT-4o by
$4.11\%$ on single-turn tasks and $1.50\%$ on multi-turn base tasks.

### [194] [Semantic Agreement Enables Efficient Open-Ended LLM Cascades](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21837)
*Duncan Soiffer,Steven Kolawole,Virginia Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Semantic agreement between ensemble outputs provides a training-free reliability signal for cascade systems in LLM deployment, enabling cost reduction by 40% and latency reduction by 60% while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cascade systems need to determine output reliability in open-ended text generation where quality exists on a continuous spectrum with multiple valid responses.

Method: Use semantic agreement (meaning-level consensus between ensemble outputs) as a training-free signal for reliable deferral in cascade systems, without requiring model internals.

Result: Semantic cascades match or surpass target-model quality at 40% of the cost and reduce latency by up to 60%, working across black-box APIs and remaining robust to model updates.

Conclusion: Semantic agreement provides a practical baseline for real-world LLM deployment that balances cost and quality effectively.

Abstract: Cascade systems route computational requests to smaller models when possible
and defer to larger models only when necessary, offering a promising approach
to balance cost and quality in LLM deployment. However, they face a fundamental
challenge in open-ended text generation: determining output reliability when
generation quality lies on a continuous spectrum, often with multiple valid
responses. To address this, we propose semantic agreement -- meaning-level
consensus between ensemble outputs -- as a training-free signal for reliable
deferral. We show that when diverse model outputs agree semantically, their
consensus is a stronger reliability signal than token-level confidence.
Evaluated from 500M to 70B-parameter models, we find that semantic cascades
match or surpass target-model quality at 40% of the cost and reduce latency by
up to 60%. Our method requires no model internals, works across black-box APIs,
and remains robust to model updates, making it a practical baseline for
real-world LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRACE is a novel framework for empathetic response generation that decomposes empathy into a structured cognitive process, combining deep analysis with expressive generation to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between analytical depth of specialized models and generative fluency of LLMs in empathetic response generation, aiming to create more human-like conversational agents.

Method: Task-decomposed reasoning framework that models empathy as a structured cognitive process through a pipeline for analysis and synthesis, building comprehensive understanding before generation.

Result: Significantly outperforms strong baselines in both automatic and LLM-based evaluations, demonstrating superior performance in empathetic response generation.

Conclusion: Structured decomposition is a promising paradigm for creating more capable and interpretable empathetic agents, successfully uniting deep analysis with expressive generation.

Abstract: Empathetic response generation is a crucial task for creating more human-like
and supportive conversational agents. However, existing methods face a core
trade-off between the analytical depth of specialized models and the generative
fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose TRACE,
Task-decomposed Reasoning for Affective Communication and Empathy, a novel
framework that models empathy as a structured cognitive process by decomposing
the task into a pipeline for analysis and synthesis. By building a
comprehensive understanding before generation, TRACE unites deep analysis with
expressive generation. Experimental results show that our framework
significantly outperforms strong baselines in both automatic and LLM-based
evaluations, confirming that our structured decomposition is a promising
paradigm for creating more capable and interpretable empathetic agents. Our

### [196] [KnowMT-Bench: Benchmarking Knowledge-Intensive Long-Form Question Answering in Multi-Turn Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21856)
*Junhao Chen,Yu Huang,Siyuan Li,Rui Yao,Hanqian Li,Hanyu Zhang,Jungang Li,Jian Chen,Bowen Wang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KnowMT-Bench is the first benchmark for evaluating multi-turn long-form question answering in knowledge-intensive domains like medicine, finance, and law, revealing that multi-turn contexts degrade factual performance and information efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are limited to single-turn dialogue or assess orthogonal capabilities rather than knowledge-intensive factuality, creating a critical gap in evaluating LLMs for real-world multi-turn knowledge applications.

Method: Uses dynamic evaluation where models generate their own multi-turn dialogue histories from progressive question sequences, then evaluates final-turn answers using human-validated automated pipeline for factual capability and information delivery efficiency.

Result: Multi-turn contexts degrade performance: factual capability declines due to contextual noise from self-generated histories, and information efficiency drops as models become more verbose with increasing dialogue length. RAG can effectively mitigate and even reverse factual degradation.

Conclusion: The benchmark is crucial for evaluating and enhancing conversational factual capabilities of LLMs in real-world knowledge-intensive applications, with RAG showing promise as a mitigation strategy for multi-turn performance degradation.

Abstract: Multi-Turn Long-Form Question Answering (MT-LFQA) is a key application
paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains.
However, existing benchmarks are limited to single-turn dialogue, while
multi-turn dialogue benchmarks typically assess other orthogonal capabilities
rather than knowledge-intensive factuality. To bridge this critical gap, we
introduce \textbf{KnowMT-Bench}, the \textit{first-ever} benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate MT-LFQA for LLMs across knowledge-intensive fields,
including medicine, finance, and law. To faithfully assess the model's
real-world performance, KnowMT-Bench employs a dynamic evaluation setting where
models generate their own multi-turn dialogue histories given logically
progressive question sequences. The factual capability and information delivery
efficiency of the \textit{final-turn} answer are then evaluated using a
human-validated automated pipeline. Our experiments reveal that multi-turn
contexts degrade performance: factual capability declines due to the contextual
noise from self-generated histories, while information efficiency drops as
models become more verbose with increasing dialogue length. We then investigate
mitigation strategies, demonstrating that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
can effectively alleviate and even reverse this factual degradation. These
findings underscore the importance of our benchmark in evaluating and enhancing
the conversational factual capabilities of LLMs in real-world
knowledge-intensive applications. Code is available at

TL;DR: LoRAN is a non-linear extension of LoRA that applies lightweight transformations to low-rank updates, with Sinter as a sine-based activation that improves performance without adding parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The linear nature of LoRA limits expressiveness in parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models.

Method: Propose LoRAN as a non-linear extension of LoRA with lightweight transformations and introduce Sinter, a sine-based activation that adds structured perturbations without increasing parameter count.

Result: Experiments across summarization and classification tasks show LoRAN consistently improves over QLoRA, with Sinter outperforming standard activations like Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh.

Conclusion: Activation design is important in low-rank tuning, and the proposed non-linear approach with sine-based activation enhances performance in parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient
fine-tuning method for large language models. However, its linear nature limits
expressiveness. We propose LoRAN, a non-linear extension of LoRA that applies
lightweight transformations to the low-rank updates. We further introduce
Sinter, a sine-based activation that adds structured perturbations without
increasing parameter count. Experiments across summarization and classification
tasks show that LoRAN consistently improves over QLoRA. Ablation studies reveal
that Sinter outperforms standard activations such as Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh,
highlighting the importance of activation design in lowrank tuning.

*Min-Hsuan Yeh,Yixuan Li,Tanwi Mallick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LUMINA is a novel framework that detects hallucinations in RAG systems by measuring context-knowledge signals through distributional distance for external context utilization and tracking token evolution across transformer layers for internal knowledge utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even with correct context, and existing detection methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning, limiting their generalizability.

Method: Quantifies external context utilization via distributional distance and measures internal knowledge utilization by tracking how predicted tokens evolve across transformer layers, with statistical validation framework.

Result: Achieves consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG benchmark, and remains robust under relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching.

Conclusion: LUMINA offers an effective and practical solution for hallucination detection in RAG systems, providing both high performance and robustness without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate hallucinations in large
language models (LLMs) by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Yet,
RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient
context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance
between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and
several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination
detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning,
limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that
detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals:
external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while
internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens
evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for
statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG
hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves
consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based
methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under
relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both
effectiveness and practicality.

*Thanh-Long V. Le,Myeongho Jeon,Kim Vu,Viet Lai,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RL-ZVP is a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that extracts learning signals from zero-variance prompts (where all responses get same reward), improving math reasoning performance over existing methods like GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods like GRPO ignore zero-variance prompts where all responses receive identical rewards, missing valuable learning opportunities from these scenarios.

Method: RL-ZVP extracts learning signals from zero-variance prompts by directly rewarding correctness and penalizing errors without contrasting responses, using token-level characteristics to modulate feedback.

Result: Across six math reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves up to 8.61 points improvement in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, consistently outperforming baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts.

Conclusion: Zero-variance prompts contain untapped learning potential in RLVR, and RL-ZVP effectively leverages this potential to significantly improve reasoning performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful framework
for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
current methods such as GRPO rely only on problems where the model responses to
the same input differ in correctness, while ignoring those where all responses
receive the same reward - so-called zero-variance prompts. In this work, we
argue that such prompts are not useless but can, in fact, provide meaningful
feedback for policy optimization. To this end, we introduce RL with
Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP), a novel algorithm that extract learning signals
from zero-variance prompts. RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes
errors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level
characteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math
reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61
points in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently
outperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts. These
results highlight the untapped potential of learning from zero-variance prompts
in RLVR.

*Yijin Guo,Ye Shen,Farong Wen,Junying Wang,Zicheng Zhang,Qi Jia,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QoNext is a new framework that adapts Quality of Experience (QoE) principles to evaluate foundation models by focusing on user interaction experience rather than just output correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for foundation models focus only on output correctness and fail to capture user experience during interaction, which is crucial for user satisfaction.

Method: QoNext identifies experiential factors, incorporates them into controlled experiments with human ratings under varied configurations, builds a QoE-oriented database, and trains predictive models to estimate user experience from system parameters.

Result: QoNext enables proactive and fine-grained evaluation of foundation models and provides actionable guidance for optimizing productized services.

Conclusion: The QoNext framework successfully bridges the gap in foundation model evaluation by focusing on user experience rather than just output quality, offering practical optimization guidance.

Abstract: Existing evaluations of foundation models, including recent human-centric
approaches, fail to capture what truly matters: user's experience during
interaction. Current methods treat evaluation as a matter of output correctness
alone, overlooking that user satisfaction emerges from the interplay between
response quality and interaction, which limits their ability to account for the
mechanisms underlying user experience. To address this gap, we introduce
QoNext, the first framework that adapts Quality of Experience (QoE) principles
from networking and multimedia to the assessment of foundation models. QoNext
identifies experiential factors that shape user experience and incorporates
them into controlled experiments, where human ratings are collected under
varied configurations. From these studies we construct a QoE-oriented database
and train predictive models that estimate perceived user experience from
measurable system parameters. Our results demonstrate that QoNext not only
enables proactive and fine-grained evaluation but also provides actionable
guidance for productized services of optimizing foundation models in practice.

*Naibin Gu,Zhenyu Zhang,Yuchen Feng,Yilong Chen,Peng Fu,Zheng Lin,Shuohuan Wang,Yu Sun,Hua Wu,Weiping Wang,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EMoE enables MoE models to scale activated experts at inference without extra training, expanding performance range 2-3x while improving peak performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MoE models degrade when activating more experts at inference due to lack of learned collaboration, despite expectation of improved performance.

Method: Simultaneously train experts to collaborate in diverse combinations and encourage router for high-quality selections, without additional training overhead.

Result: EMoE significantly expands effective performance-scaling range to 2-3x training-time k and pushes peak performance to higher level.

Conclusion: EMoE framework enables robust MoE performance across computational budgets by addressing expert collaboration issues.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models typically fix the number of activated experts
$k$ at both training and inference. Intuitively, activating more experts at
inference $k'$ (where $k'> k$) means engaging a larger set of model parameters
for the computation and thus is expected to improve performance. However,
contrary to this intuition, we find the scaling range to be so narrow that
performance begins to degrade rapidly after only a slight increase in the
number of experts. Further investigation reveals that this degradation stems
from a lack of learned collaboration among experts. To address this, we
introduce Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel training framework that
enables MoE models to scale the number of activated experts at inference
without incurring additional training overhead. By simultaneously training
experts to collaborate in diverse combinations and encouraging the router for
high-quality selections, EMoE ensures robust performance across computational
budgets at inference. We conduct extensive experiments on various MoE settings.
Our results show that EMoE significantly expands the effective
performance-scaling range, extending it to as much as 2-3$\times$ the
training-time $k$, while also pushing the model's peak performance to a higher
level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding citation intent is crucial for academic research assessment, but poses unique challenges for agglutinative languages like Turkish where existing methods are limited.

Method: Created a new Turkish citation intent dataset, evaluated standard ICL with LLMs, introduced DSPy framework for automated prompt optimization, and used stacked generalization ensemble with XGBoost meta-model for classification.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.3% for Turkish citation intent classification using the optimized ensemble approach.

Conclusion: Provides foundational dataset and robust classification framework for Turkish NLP community, enabling future qualitative citation studies in Turkish.

Abstract: Understanding the qualitative intent of citations is essential for a
comprehensive assessment of academic research, a task that poses unique
challenges for agglutinative languages like Turkish. This paper introduces a
systematic methodology and a foundational dataset to address this problem. We
first present a new, publicly available dataset of Turkish citation intents,
created with a purpose-built annotation tool. We then evaluate the performance
of standard In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs),
demonstrating that its effectiveness is limited by inconsistent results caused
by manually designed prompts. To address this core limitation, we introduce a
programmable classification pipeline built on the DSPy framework, which
automates prompt optimization systematically. For final classification, we
employ a stacked generalization ensemble to aggregate outputs from multiple
optimized models, ensuring stable and reliable predictions. This ensemble, with
an XGBoost meta-model, achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.3\%.
Ultimately, this study provides the Turkish NLP community and the broader
academic circles with a foundational dataset and a robust classification
framework paving the way for future qualitative citation studies.

TL;DR: AutoSCORE is a multi-agent LLM framework that improves automated scoring by extracting rubric-aligned components from student responses before assigning final scores, enhancing accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of using LLMs as end-to-end raters in automated scoring, including low accuracy, prompt sensitivity, limited interpretability, and rubric misalignment.

Method: Proposes AutoSCORE with two agents: Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent that extracts rubric-relevant components into structured representations, and Scoring Agent that uses these to assign final scores.

Result: Consistently improves scoring accuracy, human-machine agreement (QWK, correlations), and error metrics (MAE, RMSE) across diverse tasks and rubrics, with strong benefits on complex rubrics and smaller LLMs.

Conclusion: Structured component recognition combined with multi-agent design offers a scalable, reliable, and interpretable solution for automated scoring.

Abstract: Automated scoring plays a crucial role in education by reducing the reliance
on human raters, offering scalable and immediate evaluation of student work.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in this task,
their use as end-to-end raters faces challenges such as low accuracy, prompt
sensitivity, limited interpretability, and rubric misalignment. These issues
hinder the implementation of LLM-based automated scoring in assessment
practice. To address the limitations, we propose AutoSCORE, a multi-agent LLM
framework enhancing automated scoring via rubric-aligned Structured COmponent
REcognition. With two agents, AutoSCORE first extracts rubric-relevant
components from student responses and encodes them into a structured
representation (i.e., Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent), which is then
used to assign final scores (i.e., Scoring Agent). This design ensures that
model reasoning follows a human-like grading process, enhancing
interpretability and robustness. We evaluate AutoSCORE on four benchmark
datasets from the ASAP benchmark, using both proprietary and open-source LLMs
(GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.1-8B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B). Across diverse tasks and rubrics,
AutoSCORE consistently improves scoring accuracy, human-machine agreement (QWK,
correlations), and error metrics (MAE, RMSE) compared to single-agent
baselines, with particularly strong benefits on complex, multi-dimensional
rubrics, and especially large relative gains on smaller LLMs. These results
demonstrate that structured component recognition combined with multi-agent
design offers a scalable, reliable, and interpretable solution for automated
scoring.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SimulSense is a novel framework for simultaneous speech translation that mimics human interpreters by continuously reading input speech and triggering write decisions when new sense units are perceived, achieving superior quality-latency tradeoff and 9.6x faster decision-making than state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SimulST systems require specialized interleaved training data and rely on computationally expensive LLM inference for decision-making, which limits their real-time efficiency and practical deployment.

Method: Proposes SimulSense framework that continuously reads input speech and triggers write decisions when new sense units are perceived, mimicking human interpreter behavior without requiring specialized training data or expensive LLM inference.

Result: Achieves superior quality-latency tradeoff compared to two state-of-the-art baseline systems, with decision-making up to 9.6x faster than the baselines.

Conclusion: SimulSense provides a more efficient and effective approach to simultaneous speech translation by mimicking human interpreter reading/write decisions, offering substantial improvements in real-time efficiency without compromising translation quality.

Abstract: How to make human-interpreter-like read/write decisions for simultaneous
speech translation (SimulST) systems? Current state-of-the-art systems
formulate SimulST as a multi-turn dialogue task, requiring specialized
interleaved training data and relying on computationally expensive large
language model (LLM) inference for decision-making. In this paper, we propose
SimulSense, a novel framework for SimulST that mimics human interpreters by
continuously reading input speech and triggering write decisions to produce
translation when a new sense unit is perceived. Experiments against two
state-of-the-art baseline systems demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
a superior quality-latency tradeoff and substantially improved real-time
efficiency, where its decision-making is up to 9.6x faster than the baselines.

*Jiageng Wu,Kevin Xie,Bowen Gu,Nils Krüger,Kueiyu Joshua Lin,Jie Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which improves performance in general domains, actually degrades performance for 86.3% of LLMs in clinical text tasks from EHRs, creating a paradox where interpretability increases but reliability decreases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate CoT prompting effectiveness in clinical contexts, particularly for EHR data which is lengthy, fragmented, and noisy, where both accuracy and transparent reasoning are critical for safe deployment.

Method: Large-scale systematic study assessing 95 advanced LLMs on 87 real-world clinical text tasks across 9 languages and 8 task types, with fine-grained analyses of reasoning length, medical concept alignment, and error profiles using both LLM-as-a-judge and clinical expert evaluation.

Result: Contrary to prior findings, 86.3% of models suffered consistent performance degradation with CoT, with more capable models remaining relatively robust while weaker ones experienced substantial declines.

Conclusion: CoT creates a critical paradox in clinical contexts by enhancing interpretability but potentially undermining reliability, highlighting the need for transparent and trustworthy approaches in clinical reasoning strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to clinical care,
a domain where both accuracy and transparent reasoning are critical for safe
and trustworthy deployment. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits
step-by-step reasoning, has demonstrated improvements in performance and
interpretability across a wide range of tasks. However, its effectiveness in
clinical contexts remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of
electronic health records (EHRs), the primary source of clinical documentation,
which are often lengthy, fragmented, and noisy. In this work, we present the
first large-scale systematic study of CoT for clinical text understanding. We
assess 95 advanced LLMs on 87 real-world clinical text tasks, covering 9
languages and 8 task types. Contrary to prior findings in other domains, we
observe that 86.3\% of models suffer consistent performance degradation in the
CoT setting. More capable models remain relatively robust, while weaker ones
suffer substantial declines. To better characterize these effects, we perform
fine-grained analyses of reasoning length, medical concept alignment, and error
profiles, leveraging both LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and clinical expert
evaluation. Our results uncover systematic patterns in when and why CoT fails
in clinical contexts, which highlight a critical paradox: CoT enhances
interpretability but may undermine reliability in clinical text tasks. This
work provides an empirical basis for clinical reasoning strategies of LLMs,
highlighting the need for transparent and trustworthy approaches.

### [206] [Debiasing Large Language Models in Thai Political Stance Detection via Counterfactual Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21946)
*Kasidit Sermsri,Teerapong Panboonyuen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThaiFACTUAL is a lightweight calibration framework that reduces political bias in LLMs for Thai political stance detection using counterfactual data augmentation and rationale-based supervision, without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Political stance detection in low-resource, culturally complex settings like Thai politics is challenging due to indirect language, polarized figures, and entangled sentiment-stance relationships, leading to systematic biases in LLMs that undermine fairness and reliability.

Method: ThaiFACTUAL uses counterfactual data augmentation and rationale-based supervision to disentangle sentiment from stance and reduce bias. It's model-agnostic and doesn't require fine-tuning.

Result: Experimental results show ThaiFACTUAL significantly reduces spurious correlations, enhances zero-shot generalization, and improves fairness across multiple LLMs. The framework also includes the first high-quality Thai political stance dataset with stance, sentiment, rationales, and bias markers.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the importance of culturally grounded debiasing techniques for underrepresented languages and provides an effective solution for mitigating political bias in LLMs for low-resource settings.

Abstract: Political stance detection in low-resource and culturally complex settings
poses a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). In the Thai
political landscape - marked by indirect language, polarized figures, and
entangled sentiment and stance - LLMs often display systematic biases such as
sentiment leakage and favoritism toward entities. These biases undermine
fairness and reliability. We present ThaiFACTUAL, a lightweight, model-agnostic
calibration framework that mitigates political bias without requiring
fine-tuning. ThaiFACTUAL uses counterfactual data augmentation and
rationale-based supervision to disentangle sentiment from stance and reduce
bias. We also release the first high-quality Thai political stance dataset,
annotated with stance, sentiment, rationales, and bias markers across diverse
entities and events. Experimental results show that ThaiFACTUAL significantly
reduces spurious correlations, enhances zero-shot generalization, and improves
fairness across multiple LLMs. This work highlights the importance of
culturally grounded debiasing techniques for underrepresented languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MotivGraph-SoIQ integrates motivational knowledge graphs and Socratic dialogue to enhance LLM ideation by providing grounding and mitigating confirmation bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have potential for academic ideation but face challenges in grounding ideas and mitigating confirmation bias for refinement.

Method: Combines Motivational Knowledge Graph (storing problem, challenge, solution nodes) with dual-agent Socratic Ideator using questioning for rigorous refinement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on ICLR25 paper topics dataset across LLM-based scoring, ELO ranking, and human evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses LLM ideation limitations by providing essential grounding and practical improvement steps through motivational graphs and Socratic questioning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold substantial potential for accelerating
academic ideation but face critical challenges in grounding ideas and
mitigating confirmation bias for further refinement. We propose integrating
motivational knowledge graphs and socratic dialogue to address these
limitations in enhanced LLM ideation (MotivGraph-SoIQ). This novel framework
provides essential grounding and practical idea improvement steps for LLM
ideation by integrating a Motivational Knowledge Graph (MotivGraph) with a
Q-Driven Socratic Ideator. The MotivGraph structurally stores three key node
types(problem, challenge and solution) to offer motivation grounding for the
LLM ideation process. The Ideator is a dual-agent system utilizing Socratic
questioning, which facilitates a rigorous refinement process that mitigates
confirmation bias and improves idea quality across novelty, experimental rigor,
and motivational rationality dimensions. On the ICLR25 paper topics dataset,
MotivGraph-SoIQ exhibits clear advantages over existing state-of-the-art
approaches across LLM-based scoring, ELO ranking, and human evaluation metrics.

*Seongho Joo,Kyungmin Min,Jahyun Koo,Kyomin Jung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a black-box hallucination detection metric for LLMs based on consistency analysis under uncertainty expressions, outperforming methods requiring internal model access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs like GPT-3 generate non-factual responses (hallucinations), but existing detection methods require external resources or internal model states, which are often unavailable. There's a need for effective black-box detection approaches.

Method: Investigates LLM behavior under uncertainty expressions, finding that factual responses are consistent while non-factual ones are inconsistent. Proposes a black-box detection metric based on response consistency analysis.

Result: The proposed metric is more predictive of factuality in model responses than baseline methods that use internal knowledge of LLMs.

Conclusion: A simple black-box approach using consistency analysis under uncertainty effectively detects hallucinations in LLM responses, providing a practical solution without requiring internal model access.

Abstract: Despite the great advancement of Language modeling in recent days, Large
Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT3 are notorious for generating non-factual
responses, so-called "hallucination" problems. Existing methods for detecting
and alleviating this hallucination problem require external resources or the
internal state of LLMs, such as the output probability of each token. Given the
LLM's restricted external API availability and the limited scope of external
resources, there is an urgent demand to establish the Black-Box approach as the
cornerstone for effective hallucination detection. In this work, we propose a
simple black-box hallucination detection metric after the investigation of the
behavior of LLMs under expression of uncertainty. Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that LLMs generate consistent responses when they present factual
responses while non-consistent responses vice versa. Based on the analysis, we
propose an efficient black-box hallucination detection metric with the
expression of uncertainty. The experiment demonstrates that our metric is more
predictive of the factuality in model responses than baselines that use
internal knowledge of LLMs.

TL;DR: GraphSearch is a novel agentic deep searching workflow with dual-channel retrieval for GraphRAG that addresses limitations of shallow retrieval and inefficient graph utilization through modular multi-turn interactions and comprehensive semantic+relational querying.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GraphRAG approaches face two core limitations: shallow retrieval that fails to surface all critical evidence, and inefficient utilization of pre-constructed structural graph data, which hinders effective reasoning from complex queries.

Method: GraphSearch organizes retrieval into a modular framework with six modules for multi-turn interactions and iterative reasoning, plus a dual-channel retrieval strategy that issues semantic queries over chunk-based text data and relational queries over structural graph data.

Result: Experimental results across six multi-hop RAG benchmarks demonstrate that GraphSearch consistently improves answer accuracy and generation quality over traditional strategies.

Conclusion: GraphSearch represents a promising direction for advancing graph retrieval-augmented generation by enabling comprehensive utilization of both text and graph modalities through its dual-channel retrieval approach.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) enhances factual reasoning in
LLMs by structurally modeling knowledge through graph-based representations.
However, existing GraphRAG approaches face two core limitations: shallow
retrieval that fails to surface all critical evidence, and inefficient
utilization of pre-constructed structural graph data, which hinders effective
reasoning from complex queries. To address these challenges, we propose
\textsc{GraphSearch}, a novel agentic deep searching workflow with dual-channel
retrieval for GraphRAG. \textsc{GraphSearch} organizes the retrieval process
into a modular framework comprising six modules, enabling multi-turn
interactions and iterative reasoning. Furthermore, \textsc{GraphSearch} adopts
a dual-channel retrieval strategy that issues semantic queries over chunk-based
text data and relational queries over structural graph data, enabling
comprehensive utilization of both modalities and their complementary strengths.
Experimental results across six multi-hop RAG benchmarks demonstrate that
\textsc{GraphSearch} consistently improves answer accuracy and generation
quality over the traditional strategy, confirming \textsc{GraphSearch} as a
promising direction for advancing graph retrieval-augmented generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety methods like guardrails and tool calling are insufficient for clinical domains where inaccurate or harmful responses can have serious consequences.

Method: Developed TACOS taxonomy that classifies user intents across 21 categories, explicitly modeling safety thresholds and external tool dependencies in a unified framework.

Result: Experiments with TACOS-annotated dataset demonstrated the value of specialized taxonomy for clinical agents and provided insights about training data distribution and pretrained model knowledge.

Conclusion: TACOS provides a comprehensive safety framework for clinical chatbots by integrating safety filtering and tool selection through fine-grained intent classification.

Abstract: Safety is a paramount concern in clinical chatbot applications, where
inaccurate or harmful responses can lead to serious consequences. Existing
methods--such as guardrails and tool calling--often fall short in addressing
the nuanced demands of the clinical domain. In this paper, we introduce TACOS
(TAxonomy of COmprehensive Safety for Clinical Agents), a fine-grained,
21-class taxonomy that integrates safety filtering and tool selection into a
single user intent classification step. TACOS is a taxonomy that can cover a
wide spectrum of clinical and non-clinical queries, explicitly modeling varying
safety thresholds and external tool dependencies. To validate our framework, we
curate a TACOS-annotated dataset and perform extensive experiments. Our results
demonstrate the value of a new taxonomy specialized for clinical agent
settings, and reveal useful insights about train data distribution and
pretrained knowledge of base models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Fuzzy Reasoning Chain (FRC) framework that combines LLM semantic priors with fuzzy membership degrees to handle ambiguity and uncertainty in NLP tasks, showing improved interpretability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in LLMs, significant challenges remain in handling texts with ambiguity, polysemy, or uncertainty that traditional probability-based methods cannot adequately address.

Method: The FRC framework integrates LLM semantic priors with continuous fuzzy membership degrees, creating explicit interaction between probability-based reasoning and fuzzy membership reasoning to gradually transform ambiguous inputs into clear decisions.

Result: Validation on sentiment analysis tasks shows FRC ensures stable reasoning, facilitates knowledge transfer across different model scales, and captures conflicting/uncertain signals that traditional methods miss.

Conclusion: FRC provides a general mechanism for managing subtle and ambiguous expressions with improved interpretability and robustness in NLP applications.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), natural language
processing (NLP) has achieved remarkable progress. Nonetheless, significant
challenges remain in handling texts with ambiguity, polysemy, or uncertainty.
We introduce the Fuzzy Reasoning Chain (FRC) framework, which integrates LLM
semantic priors with continuous fuzzy membership degrees, creating an explicit
interaction between probability-based reasoning and fuzzy membership reasoning.
This transition allows ambiguous inputs to be gradually transformed into clear
and interpretable decisions while capturing conflicting or uncertain signals
that traditional probability-based methods cannot. We validate FRC on sentiment
analysis tasks, where both theoretical analysis and empirical results show that
it ensures stable reasoning and facilitates knowledge transfer across different
model scales. These findings indicate that FRC provides a general mechanism for
managing subtle and ambiguous expressions with improved interpretability and
robustness.

Motivation: Existing datasets mainly depict static AIGT detection, but social media content dynamics are driven by user engagement and evolve over time, creating unique challenges for AIGT analysis.

Method: Created RedNote-Vibe dataset from Xiaohongshu platform with user engagement metrics and timestamps, and proposed PLAD framework leveraging psycholinguistic features for interpretable AIGT detection.

Result: PLAD achieves superior detection performance, provides insights into signatures distinguishing human and AI-generated content, and reveals complex relationships between linguistic features and social media engagement.

Conclusion: The work enables research into temporal dynamics and user interaction patterns of AIGT, offering both a valuable dataset and an effective interpretable detection framework for social media AIGT analysis.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to widespread
AI-Generated Text (AIGT) on social media platforms, creating unique challenges
where content dynamics are driven by user engagement and evolve over time.
However, existing datasets mainly depict static AIGT detection. In this work,
we introduce RedNote-Vibe, the first longitudinal (5-years) dataset for social
media AIGT analysis. This dataset is sourced from Xiaohongshu platform,
containing user engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments) and timestamps
spanning from the pre-LLM period to July 2025, which enables research into the
temporal dynamics and user interaction patterns of AIGT. Furthermore, to detect
AIGT in the context of social media, we propose PsychoLinguistic AIGT Detection
Framework (PLAD), an interpretable approach that leverages psycholinguistic
features. Our experiments show that PLAD achieves superior detection
performance and provides insights into the signatures distinguishing human and
AI-generated content. More importantly, it reveals the complex relationship
between these linguistic features and social media engagement. The dataset is

### [214] [The QCET Taxonomy of Standard Quality Criterion Names and Definitions for the Evaluation of NLP Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22064)
*Anya Belz,Simon Mille,Craig Thomson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QCET is a taxonomy that standardizes NLP evaluation quality criteria to address the problem of misleading comparability when different studies use the same criterion names but evaluate different aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP evaluations often use the same quality criterion names (e.g., Fluency) but evaluate different aspects, making it impossible to reliably compare results across studies and hindering scientific progress in the field.

Method: Created QCET taxonomy by deriving standard quality criterion names and definitions from three surveys of NLP evaluations, structuring them into a hierarchical taxonomy where parent nodes capture common aspects of child nodes.

Result: Developed QCET taxonomy with standardized quality criteria names and definitions that existing NLP evaluation criteria can be mapped to, providing a grounded framework for comparability.

Conclusion: QCET enables three main uses: establishing comparability of existing evaluations, guiding design of new evaluations, and assessing regulatory compliance, addressing a long-standing issue in NLP evaluation methodology.

Abstract: Prior work has shown that two NLP evaluation experiments that report results
for the same quality criterion name (e.g. Fluency) do not necessarily evaluate
the same aspect of quality, and the comparability implied by the name can be
misleading. Not knowing when two evaluations are comparable in this sense means
we currently lack the ability to draw reliable conclusions about system quality
on the basis of multiple, independently conducted evaluations. This in turn
hampers the ability of the field to progress scientifically as a whole, a
pervasive issue in NLP since its beginning (Sparck Jones, 1981). It is hard to
see how the issue of unclear comparability can be fully addressed other than by
the creation of a standard set of quality criterion names and definitions that
the several hundred quality criterion names actually in use in the field can be
mapped to, and grounded in. Taking a strictly descriptive approach, the QCET
Quality Criteria for Evaluation Taxonomy derives a standard set of quality
criterion names and definitions from three surveys of evaluations reported in
NLP, and structures them into a hierarchy where each parent node captures
common aspects of its child nodes. We present QCET and the resources it
consists of, and discuss its three main uses in (i) establishing comparability
of existing evaluations, (ii) guiding the design of new evaluations, and (iii)
assessing regulatory compliance.

*Wanli Yang,Fei Sun,Rui Tang,Hongyu Zang,Du Su,Qi Cao,Jingang Wang,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning can be effective for model editing when using breadth-first pipeline with mini-batch optimization instead of depth-first sequential editing, and when combined with localized tuning locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the belief that fine-tuning is ineffective for model editing, arguing that previous failures stem from improper adaptation to sequential editing tasks rather than inherent limitations of fine-tuning.

Method: Restore fine-tuning to standard breadth-first (epoch-based) pipeline with mini-batch optimization, and develop LocFT-BF method with systematic analysis of optimal tuning locations for localized editing.

Result: LocFT-BF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins, sustains 100K edits and 72B-parameter models (10x beyond prior practice) without sacrificing general capabilities.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning can be advanced from an underestimated baseline to a leading method for model editing by correcting misconceptions about pipeline design and introducing principled localized tuning strategies.

Abstract: Fine-tuning, a foundational method for adapting large language models, has
long been considered ineffective for model editing. Here, we challenge this
belief, arguing that the reported failure arises not from the inherent
limitation of fine-tuning itself, but from adapting it to the sequential nature
of the editing task, a single-pass depth-first pipeline that optimizes each
sample to convergence before moving on. While intuitive, this depth-first
pipeline coupled with sample-wise updating over-optimizes each edit and induces
interference across edits. Our controlled experiments reveal that simply
restoring fine-tuning to the standard breadth-first (i.e., epoch-based)
pipeline with mini-batch optimization substantially improves its effectiveness
for model editing. Moreover, fine-tuning in editing also suffers from
suboptimal tuning parameter locations inherited from prior methods. Through
systematic analysis of tuning locations, we derive LocFT-BF, a simple and
effective localized editing method built on the restored fine-tuning framework.
Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate that
LocFT-BF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Notably, to our
knowledge, it is the first to sustain 100K edits and 72B-parameter models,10 x
beyond prior practice, without sacrificing general capabilities. By clarifying
a long-standing misconception and introducing a principled localized tuning
strategy, we advance fine-tuning from an underestimated baseline to a leading
method for model editing, establishing a solid foundation for future research.

*Dmitriy Shopkhoev,Denis Makhov,Magauiya Zhussip,Ammar Ali,Stamatios Lefkimmiatis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoSpaDi is a training-free LLM compression framework that uses structured sparse dictionary learning instead of low-rank approximation, achieving better accuracy through union-of-subspaces representation and data-aware optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-rank weight approximation in LLM compression is computationally efficient but structurally rigid, leading to noticeable accuracy drops. A more flexible approach is needed that can better preserve model fidelity without fine-tuning.

Method: CoSpaDi replaces low-rank decomposition with structured sparse factorization using dense dictionaries and column-sparse coefficient matrices. It uses a small calibration dataset to optimize factorization for minimal functional reconstruction error rather than weight approximation.

Result: CoSpaDi consistently outperforms state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods in accuracy and perplexity across multiple Llama and Qwen models at 20-50% compression ratios, while being compatible with post-training quantization.

Conclusion: Structured sparse dictionary learning is established as a powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM deployment, offering greater expressiveness and better model fidelity preservation.

Abstract: Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on
low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix
in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient
strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a
noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression
via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework
that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse
factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense
dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a
union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight
matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected
dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant
basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the
factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers
closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional
reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware
strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under
reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity
allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with
post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate
CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group
settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority
over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and
perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a
powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: DAS is a framework for generating multilingual dialogues from abstract intent representations, avoiding direct translation to produce culturally appropriate conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-English dialogue datasets are scarce, and using translations of English dialogues introduces artifacts that reduce naturalness and cultural appropriateness.

Method: Dialogue Act Script (DAS) uses structured dialogue act representations to encode, localize, and generate multilingual dialogues from abstract intent representations rather than translating directly.

Result: Human evaluations across Italian, German, and Chinese show DAS-generated dialogues outperform both machine and human translators on cultural relevance, coherence, and situational appropriateness.

Conclusion: DAS enables flexible localization across languages, mitigating translationese and producing more fluent, naturalistic conversations compared to translation-based approaches.

Abstract: Non-English dialogue datasets are scarce, and models are often trained or
evaluated on translations of English-language dialogues, an approach which can
introduce artifacts that reduce their naturalness and cultural appropriateness.
This work proposes Dialogue Act Script (DAS), a structured framework for
encoding, localizing, and generating multilingual dialogues from abstract
intent representations. Rather than translating dialogue utterances directly,
DAS enables the generation of new dialogues in the target language that are
culturally and contextually appropriate. By using structured dialogue act
representations, DAS supports flexible localization across languages,
mitigating translationese and enabling more fluent, naturalistic conversations.
Human evaluations across Italian, German, and Chinese show that DAS-generated
dialogues consistently outperform those produced by both machine and human
translators on measures of cultural relevance, coherence, and situational
appropriateness.

*Shaoning Sun,Jiachen Yu,Zongqi Wang,Xuewei Yang,Tianle Gu,Yujiu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies a "solve-to-judge gap" in generative reward models where they can solve problems but fail to judge them correctly, and proposes S2J approach that links solving and judging capabilities to reduce this gap by 16.2% and improve judgment performance by 5.8%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant solve-to-judge gap observed in generative reward models (GRMs), where models struggle to make correct judgments on queries they can actually solve (14%-37% of cases), despite the general understanding that stronger problem-solving capabilities should lead to better judgment abilities.

Method: Proposes Solve-to-Judge (S2J) approach that simultaneously leverages both solving and judging capabilities from a single GRM's output for supervision, explicitly linking problem-solving and evaluation abilities during model optimization to narrow the solve-to-judge gap.

Result: S2J effectively reduces the solve-to-judge gap by 16.2% and enhances judgment performance by 5.8%. It achieves state-of-the-art performance among GRMs built on the same base model while using significantly smaller training datasets, and accomplishes this through self-evolution without relying on external models for distillation.

Conclusion: The S2J approach successfully addresses the solve-to-judge gap in generative reward models by explicitly connecting problem-solving and judgment capabilities during optimization, leading to improved performance with fewer training data and without external model dependencies.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), generative reward
models (GRMs) have been widely adopted for reward modeling and evaluation.
Previous studies have primarily focused on training specialized GRMs by
optimizing them on preference datasets with the judgment correctness as
supervision. While it's widely accepted that GRMs with stronger problem-solving
capabilities typically exhibit superior judgment abilities, we first identify a
significant solve-to-judge gap when examining individual queries. Specifically,
the solve-to-judge gap refers to the phenomenon where GRMs struggle to make
correct judgments on some queries (14%-37%), despite being fully capable of
solving them. In this paper, we propose the Solve-to-Judge (S2J) approach to
address this problem. Specifically, S2J simultaneously leverages both the
solving and judging capabilities on a single GRM's output for supervision,
explicitly linking the GRM's problem-solving and evaluation abilities during
model optimization, thereby narrowing the gap. Our comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that S2J effectively reduces the solve-to-judge gap by 16.2%,
thereby enhancing the model's judgment performance by 5.8%. Notably, S2J
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among GRMs built on the same base
model while utilizing a significantly smaller training dataset. Moreover, S2J
accomplishes this through self-evolution without relying on more powerful
external models for distillation.

*Primakov Chungkham,V Venktesh,Vinay Setty,Avishek Anand*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces VerifierFC, a method that uses test-time scaling with multiple reasoning paths and a verifier model to improve fact-checking of complex numerical claims, achieving 18.8% performance improvement over single-shot methods with 1.8x higher efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with fact-checking real-world numerical claims due to difficulties in compositional and numerical reasoning, understanding numerical nuances, and reasoning drift issues where models misinterpret information and backtrack.

Method: The authors explore scaling test-time compute (TTS) by eliciting multiple reasoning paths from LLMs and training a verifier model (VERIFIERFC) to select the best reasoning path. They also introduce an adaptive mechanism that performs TTS selectively based on claim complexity.

Result: TTS helps mitigate reasoning drift and achieves significant performance gains. The adaptive TTS approach achieves 1.8x higher efficiency than standard TTS while delivering 18.8% performance improvement over single-shot claim verification methods.

Conclusion: Test-time compute scaling with multiple reasoning paths and verifier models is effective for fact-checking complex numerical claims, addressing reasoning drift issues while maintaining computational efficiency through adaptive mechanisms.

Abstract: Fact-checking real-world claims, particularly numerical claims, is inherently
complex that require multistep reasoning and numerical reasoning for verifying
diverse aspects of the claim. Although large language models (LLMs) including
reasoning models have made tremendous advances, they still fall short on
fact-checking real-world claims that require a combination of compositional and
numerical reasoning. They are unable to understand nuance of numerical aspects,
and are also susceptible to the reasoning drift issue, where the model is
unable to contextualize diverse information resulting in misinterpretation and
backtracking of reasoning process. In this work, we systematically explore
scaling test-time compute (TTS) for LLMs on the task of fact-checking complex
numerical claims, which entails eliciting multiple reasoning paths from an LLM.
We train a verifier model (VERIFIERFC) to navigate this space of possible
reasoning paths and select one that could lead to the correct verdict. We
observe that TTS helps mitigate the reasoning drift issue, leading to
significant performance gains for fact-checking numerical claims. To improve
compute efficiency in TTS, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that performs TTS
selectively based on the perceived complexity of the claim. This approach
achieves 1.8x higher efficiency than standard TTS, while delivering a notable
18.8% performance improvement over single-shot claim verification methods. Our

TL;DR: Uni-LAP is a universal framework for legal article prediction that combines supervised classification models with large language models through tight collaboration, using Top-K loss for candidate generation and syllogism-inspired reasoning for final prediction refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for legal article prediction face challenges: supervised models struggle with complex fact patterns, LLMs perform poorly in predictive scenarios due to abstract legal article IDs, and most approaches lack cross-jurisdictional applicability.

Method: Uni-LAP integrates SCMs and LLMs with a novel Top-K loss function for accurate candidate article generation and syllogism-inspired reasoning for final prediction refinement.

Result: Empirical evaluation on multiple jurisdiction datasets shows Uni-LAP consistently outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: The proposed Uni-LAP framework successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by combining strengths of SCMs and LLMs, achieving superior performance in legal article prediction across different legal systems.

Abstract: Legal Article Prediction (LAP) is a critical task in legal text
classification, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
automatically predict relevant legal articles based on the fact descriptions of
cases. As a foundational step in legal decision-making, LAP plays a pivotal
role in determining subsequent judgments, such as charges and penalties.
Despite its importance, existing methods face significant challenges in
addressing the complexities of LAP. Supervised classification models (SCMs),
such as CNN and BERT, struggle to fully capture intricate fact patterns due to
their inherent limitations. Conversely, large language models (LLMs), while
excelling in generative tasks, perform suboptimally in predictive scenarios due
to the abstract and ID-based nature of legal articles. Furthermore, the
diversity of legal systems across jurisdictions exacerbates the issue, as most
approaches are tailored to specific countries and lack broader applicability.
To address these limitations, we propose Uni-LAP, a universal framework for
legal article prediction that integrates the strengths of SCMs and LLMs through
tight collaboration. Specifically, in Uni-LAP, the SCM is enhanced with a novel
Top-K loss function to generate accurate candidate articles, while the LLM
employs syllogism-inspired reasoning to refine the final predictions. We
evaluated Uni-LAP on datasets from multiple jurisdictions, and empirical
results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing
baselines, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.

TL;DR: Survey of 31 multilingual vision-language models and 21 benchmarks, revealing tension between language neutrality (consistent cross-lingual representations) and cultural awareness (adaptation to cultural contexts).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine multilingual vision-language models that process text and images across languages and identify key challenges in their development and evaluation.

Method: Review of 31 models and 21 benchmarks, analyzing encoder-only and generative architectures, training methods, and evaluation approaches including translation-based and culturally grounded content.

Result: Found current training methods favor language neutrality through contrastive learning, while cultural awareness depends on diverse data. Two-thirds of benchmarks use translation-based approaches prioritizing semantic consistency. Identified discrepancies in cross-lingual capabilities and gaps between training objectives and evaluation goals.

Conclusion: There is a fundamental tension between achieving language neutrality and cultural awareness in multilingual vision-language models, with current approaches favoring neutrality and revealing misalignment between training methods and evaluation objectives.

Abstract: This survey examines multilingual vision-language models that process text
and images across languages. We review 31 models and 21 benchmarks, spanning
encoder-only and generative architectures, and identify a key tension between
language neutrality (consistent cross-lingual representations) and cultural
awareness (adaptation to cultural contexts). Current training methods favor
neutrality through contrastive learning, while cultural awareness depends on
diverse data. Two-thirds of evaluation benchmarks use translation-based
approaches prioritizing semantic consistency, though recent work incorporates
culturally grounded content. We find discrepancies in cross-lingual
capabilities and gaps between training objectives and evaluation goals.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FoodSEM is a fine-tuned LLM for food named-entity linking that achieves state-of-the-art performance (up to 98% F1) by linking food entities to ontologies like FoodOn, SNOMED-CT, and Hansard taxonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs and custom domain-specific models cannot accurately solve food named-entity linking tasks, creating a need for specialized food NEL capabilities.

Method: Fine-tuned an open-source LLM using instruction-response scenarios on food-annotated corpora to link food entities to multiple ontologies (FoodOn, SNOMED-CT, Hansard taxonomy).

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with F1 scores up to 98% on some ontologies and datasets, significantly outperforming zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot LLM baselines.

Conclusion: FoodSEM provides a robust model for food semantic understanding, published food-annotated corpora for LLM fine-tuning, and establishes a strong baseline for future food NEL benchmarking.

Abstract: This paper introduces FoodSEM, a state-of-the-art fine-tuned open-source
large language model (LLM) for named-entity linking (NEL) to food-related
ontologies. To the best of our knowledge, food NEL is a task that cannot be
accurately solved by state-of-the-art general-purpose (large) language models
or custom domain-specific models/systems. Through an instruction-response (IR)
scenario, FoodSEM links food-related entities mentioned in a text to several
ontologies, including FoodOn, SNOMED-CT, and the Hansard taxonomy. The FoodSEM
model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to related models/systems,
with F1 scores even reaching 98% on some ontologies and datasets. The presented
comparative analyses against zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot LLM prompting
baselines further highlight FoodSEM's superior performance over its
non-fine-tuned version. By making FoodSEM and its related resources publicly
available, the main contributions of this article include (1) publishing a
food-annotated corpora into an IR format suitable for LLM
fine-tuning/evaluation, (2) publishing a robust model to advance the semantic
understanding of text in the food domain, and (3) providing a strong baseline
on food NEL for future benchmarking.

*Hongyu Shan,Mingyang Song,Chang Dai,Di Liang,Han Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R-Capsule is a framework that compresses reasoning steps into learned latent tokens to improve efficiency while maintaining transparency, balancing efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought prompting increases latency and memory usage while potentially propagating errors; there's a need to combine efficiency of latent reasoning with transparency of explicit reasoning.

Method: Compress high-level reasoning plans into small sets of learned latent tokens (Reasoning Capsules) using Information Bottleneck principle, with dual objectives: task accuracy loss and plan-reconstruction loss.

Result: Reduces visible token footprint while maintaining or improving accuracy on complex benchmarks.

Conclusion: R-Capsule strikes a balance between efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs) tackle
complex reasoning by eliciting explicit step-by-step rationales. However, CoT's
verbosity increases latency and memory usage and may propagate early errors
across long chains. We propose the Reasoning Capsule (R-Capsule), a framework
that aims to combine the efficiency of latent reasoning with the transparency
of explicit CoT. The core idea is to compress the high-level plan into a small
set of learned latent tokens (a Reasoning Capsule) while keeping execution
steps lightweight or explicit. This hybrid approach is inspired by the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, where we encourage the capsule to be
approximately minimal yet sufficient for the task. Minimality is encouraged via
a low-capacity bottleneck, which helps improve efficiency. Sufficiency is
encouraged via a dual objective: a primary task loss for answer accuracy and an
auxiliary plan-reconstruction loss that encourages the capsule to faithfully
represent the original textual plan. The reconstruction objective helps ground
the latent space, thereby improving interpretability and reducing the use of
uninformative shortcuts. Our framework strikes a balance between efficiency,
accuracy, and interpretability, thereby reducing the visible token footprint of
reasoning while maintaining or improving accuracy on complex benchmarks. Our

### [224] [Bridging Draft Policy Misalignment: Group Tree Optimization for Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22134)
*Shijing Hu,Jingyang Li,Zhihui Lu,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GTO (Group Tree Optimization) addresses draft policy misalignment in speculative decoding by aligning training with the decoding-time tree policy, improving acceptance length by 7.4% and providing 7.7% additional speedup over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training objectives optimize only a single greedy draft path while decoding follows a tree policy that verifies multiple branches, creating draft policy misalignment that limits achievable speedups in speculative decoding.

Method: GTO uses two components: (1) Draft Tree Reward - a sampling-free objective measuring expected acceptance length of draft trees under the target model, and (2) Group-based Draft Policy Training - a stable optimization scheme that contrasts trees from current and frozen reference models using debiased group-standardized advantages and PPO-style surrogate updates.

Result: Across dialogue (MT-Bench), code (HumanEval), and math (GSM8K) tasks with multiple LLMs (LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Vicuna-1.3-13B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B), GTO increases acceptance length by 7.4% and yields 7.7% additional speedup over state-of-the-art EAGLE-3.

Conclusion: By bridging draft policy misalignment, GTO offers a practical, general solution for efficient LLM inference through improved speculative decoding performance.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by
letting a lightweight draft model propose multiple tokens that the target model
verifies in parallel. Yet existing training objectives optimize only a single
greedy draft path, while decoding follows a tree policy that re-ranks and
verifies multiple branches. This draft policy misalignment limits achievable
speedups. We introduce Group Tree Optimization (GTO), which aligns training
with the decoding-time tree policy through two components: (i) Draft Tree
Reward, a sampling-free objective equal to the expected acceptance length of
the draft tree under the target model, directly measuring decoding performance;
(ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training, a stable optimization scheme that
contrasts trees from the current and a frozen reference draft model, forming
debiased group-standardized advantages and applying a PPO-style surrogate along
the longest accepted sequence for robust updates. We further prove that
increasing our Draft Tree Reward provably improves acceptance length and
speedup. Across dialogue (MT-Bench), code (HumanEval), and math (GSM8K), and
multiple LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Vicuna-1.3-13B,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B), GTO increases acceptance length by 7.4% and
yields an additional 7.7% speedup over prior state-of-the-art EAGLE-3. By
bridging draft policy misalignment, GTO offers a practical, general solution
for efficient LLM inference.

TL;DR: MACC is a framework that progressively compresses Chain-of-Thought reasoning via multiround refinement, leveraging token elasticity to optimize compression depth per input, achieving better accuracy with reduced latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought reasoning improves performance on complex tasks but introduces significant inference latency due to verbosity, creating a need for efficient compression methods.

Method: Multiround Adaptive Chain-of-Thought Compression (MACC) framework that leverages token elasticity phenomenon and progressively compresses CoTs via multiround refinement to determine optimal compression depth for each input.

Result: Achieves average accuracy improvement of 5.6% over state-of-the-art baselines, reduces CoT length by average 47 tokens, significantly lowers latency, and enables reliable prediction of test-time performance using interpretable features.

Conclusion: MACC demonstrates that CoT compression is both effective and predictable, enabling efficient model selection and forecasting without repeated fine-tuning across different models.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves performance on complex tasks but
introduces significant inference latency due to verbosity. We propose
Multiround Adaptive Chain-of-Thought Compression (MACC), a framework that
leverages the token elasticity phenomenon--where overly small token budgets can
paradoxically increase output length--to progressively compress CoTs via
multiround refinement. This adaptive strategy allows MACC to determine the
optimal compression depth for each input. Our method achieves an average
accuracy improvement of 5.6 percent over state-of-the-art baselines, while also
reducing CoT length by an average of 47 tokens and significantly lowering
latency. Furthermore, we show that test-time performance--accuracy and token
length--can be reliably predicted using interpretable features like perplexity
and compression rate on the training set. Evaluated across different models,
our method enables efficient model selection and forecasting without repeated
fine-tuning, demonstrating that CoT compression is both effective and
predictable. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MACC.

TL;DR: This paper investigates machine-generated text detection across multiple scenarios including binary/multiclass classification, generator attribution, sentence-level segmentation, and adversarial attacks, introducing the BMAS English dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address critical questions about the authenticity of human work and preservation of human creativity in the face of increasingly creative LLMs, and to improve machine-generated text detection capabilities.

Method: Introduces BMAS English dataset for multiple detection tasks: binary classification (human vs machine), multiclass classification (identifying specific generators), sentence-level segmentation (detecting human-AI collaborative text boundaries), and adversarial attack scenarios.

Result: The paper presents a comprehensive dataset and framework for machine-generated text detection that addresses multiple real-world scenarios beyond simple binary classification.

Conclusion: This work aims to address previous limitations in Machine-Generated Text Detection (MGTD) in a more meaningful way by covering diverse detection scenarios and challenges.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gearing up to surpass human creativity. The
veracity of the statement needs careful consideration. In recent developments,
critical questions arise regarding the authenticity of human work and the
preservation of their creativity and innovative abilities. This paper
investigates such issues. This paper addresses machine-generated text detection
across several scenarios, including document-level binary and multiclass
classification or generator attribution, sentence-level segmentation to
differentiate between human-AI collaborative text, and adversarial attacks
aimed at reducing the detectability of machine-generated text. We introduce a
new work called BMAS English: an English language dataset for binary
classification of human and machine text, for multiclass classification, which
not only identifies machine-generated text but can also try to determine its
generator, and Adversarial attack addressing where it is a common act for the
mitigation of detection, and Sentence-level segmentation, for predicting the
boundaries between human and machine-generated text. We believe that this paper
will address previous work in Machine-Generated Text Detection (MGTD) in a more
meaningful way.

### [228] [Context Parametrization with Compositional Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22158)
*Josip Jukić,Martin Tutek,Jan Šnajder*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CompAs is a meta-learning framework that translates context into compositional adapter parameters, enabling algebraic merging of multiple information chunks without reprocessing long prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of in-context learning (inefficient with many demonstrations) and supervised fine-tuning (training overhead, inflexibility) by generating adapters from context.

Method: Meta-learning framework that translates context into adapter parameters with compositional structure, enabling algebraic merging of adapters from different inputs without reprocessing prompts.

Result: Outperforms ICL and prior generator-based methods on multiple-choice and extractive QA tasks, especially when scaling to more inputs. Provides lower inference cost, robustness to long-context instability, and handles inputs exceeding context window.

Conclusion: Composable adapter generation is a practical and efficient alternative for scaling LLM deployment, with reversible encoding for safety/security benefits.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often seamlessly adapt to new tasks through
in-context learning (ICL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, both of
these approaches face key limitations: ICL is inefficient when handling many
demonstrations, and SFT incurs training overhead while sacrificing flexibility.
Mapping instructions or demonstrations from context directly into adapter
parameters offers an appealing alternative. While prior work explored
generating adapters based on a single input context, it has overlooked the need
to integrate multiple chunks of information. To address this gap, we introduce
CompAs, a meta-learning framework that translates context into adapter
parameters with a compositional structure. Adapters generated this way can be
merged algebraically, enabling instructions, demonstrations, or retrieved
passages to be seamlessly combined without reprocessing long prompts.
Critically, this approach yields three benefits: lower inference cost,
robustness to long-context instability, and establishes a principled solution
when input exceeds the model's context window. Furthermore, CompAs encodes
information into adapter parameters in a reversible manner, enabling recovery
of input context through a decoder, facilitating safety and security. Empirical
results on diverse multiple-choice and extractive question answering tasks show
that CompAs outperforms ICL and prior generator-based methods, especially when
scaling to more inputs. Our work establishes composable adapter generation as a
practical and efficient alternative for scaling LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reasoning models consistently outperform or match larger instruction fine-tuned models across various tasks, becoming increasingly valuable at larger scales despite higher training/inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate when reasoning becomes effective in LLMs, the optimal model scales for reasoning, and the cost-performance tradeoffs between reasoning and instruction fine-tuning approaches.

Method: Used synthetic data distillation framework to conduct large-scale supervised study comparing Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) and reasoning models of varying sizes across math-centric and general-purpose tasks in multiple-choice and open-ended formats.

Result: Reasoning consistently improves model performance, often matching or surpassing significantly larger IFT systems. Reasoning models become increasingly valuable as model size scales and overcome IFT performance limits on reasoning-intensive and open-ended tasks.

Conclusion: While IFT remains Pareto-optimal for training and inference costs, reasoning capabilities provide substantial performance benefits, especially at larger model scales and for complex tasks requiring deeper reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. Despite its empirical
success, the tasks and model scales at which reasoning becomes effective, as
well as its training and inference costs, remain underexplored. In this work,
we rely on a synthetic data distillation framework to conduct a large-scale
supervised study. We compare Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) and reasoning models
of varying sizes, on a wide range of math-centric and general-purpose tasks,
evaluating both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Our analysis reveals
that reasoning consistently improves model performance, often matching or
surpassing significantly larger IFT systems. Notably, while IFT remains
Pareto-optimal in training and inference costs, reasoning models become
increasingly valuable as model size scales, overcoming IFT performance limits
on reasoning-intensive and open-ended tasks.

*Anandi Hattiangadi,Anders J. Schoubye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM outputs are meaningless because they lack the necessary intentions for literal meaning, despite appearing meaningful and being useful for acquiring knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To argue that large language models cannot produce meaningful outputs due to their inability to have the right kinds of intentions required for literal meaning.

Method: Present a philosophical argument based on two premises: (1) certain intentions are needed for literal meaning, and (2) LLMs cannot have these intentions. Defend against semantic externalist and internalist counterarguments.

Result: The argument concludes that LLM outputs are meaningless, but acknowledges that they appear meaningful and can be used to acquire true beliefs and knowledge.

Conclusion: While LLM outputs lack literal meaning due to absence of proper intentions, they can still appear meaningful and serve practical purposes in knowledge acquisition.

Abstract: In this paper, we offer a simple argument for the conclusion that the outputs
of large language models (LLMs) are meaningless. Our argument is based on two
key premises: (a) that certain kinds of intentions are needed in order for
LLMs' outputs to have literal meanings, and (b) that LLMs cannot plausibly have
the right kinds of intentions. We defend this argument from various types of
responses, for example, the semantic externalist argument that deference can be
assumed to take the place of intentions and the semantic internalist argument
that meanings can be defined purely in terms of intrinsic relations between
concepts, such as conceptual roles. We conclude the paper by discussing why,
even if our argument is sound, the outputs of LLMs nevertheless seem meaningful
and can be used to acquire true beliefs and even knowledge.

*Tiago Fernandes Tavares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RTP is a novel framework that uses LLMs to build interpretable binary tree taxonomies through natural language questions, outperforming traditional keyword-based topic models in interpretability and downstream task utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic models produce hard-to-interpret keyword lists and lack semantic coherence, creating an interpretability gap especially in data-scarce domains.

Method: RTP leverages LLMs to interactively build a binary tree where each node is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data, creating a fully interpretable taxonomy.

Result: RTP's question-driven hierarchy is more interpretable than BERTopic's keyword-based topics and serves as powerful features in downstream classification tasks when themes correlate with task labels.

Conclusion: RTP shifts data exploration from statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis and enables structured, controllable prompts for generative models, transforming analysis into synthesis tools.

Abstract: Unsupervised analysis of text corpora is challenging, especially in
data-scarce domains where traditional topic models struggle. While these models
offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that
require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic
coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce
Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the
tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data,
resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is
explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is
more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like
BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters
by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks,
particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels.
RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from
statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve
as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our
analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the
consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source
corpus.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StableToken introduces a multi-branch tokenizer with bit-wise voting to achieve robust semantic speech tokenization that remains stable under acoustic perturbations, unlike current fragile tokenizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic speech tokenizers are surprisingly fragile to meaning-irrelevant acoustic perturbations, causing drastic token sequence changes even at high SNRs where speech remains intelligible, which increases learning burden for downstream LLMs.

Method: StableToken uses a multi-branch architecture that processes audio in parallel, then merges representations through a powerful bit-wise voting mechanism to form a single, stable token sequence.

Result: StableToken achieves state-of-the-art token stability, drastically reducing Unit Edit Distance (UED) under diverse noise conditions, and significantly improves robustness of SpeechLLMs on various tasks.

Conclusion: The consensus-driven mechanism in StableToken provides foundational stability that directly translates to downstream benefits for speech language models.

Abstract: Prevalent semantic speech tokenizers, designed to capture linguistic content,
are surprisingly fragile. We find they are not robust to meaning-irrelevant
acoustic perturbations; even at high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) where speech
is perfectly intelligible, their output token sequences can change drastically,
increasing the learning burden for downstream LLMs. This instability stems from
two flaws: a brittle single-path quantization architecture and a distant
training signal indifferent to intermediate token stability. To address this,
we introduce StableToken, a tokenizer that achieves stability through a
consensus-driven mechanism. Its multi-branch architecture processes audio in
parallel, and these representations are merged via a powerful bit-wise voting
mechanism to form a single, stable token sequence. StableToken sets a new
state-of-the-art in token stability, drastically reducing Unit Edit Distance
(UED) under diverse noise conditions. This foundational stability translates
directly to downstream benefits, significantly improving the robustness of
SpeechLLMs on a variety of tasks.

Motivation: Current LLMs rely on singular reasoning paradigms, limiting their performance on complex problems that require diverse cognitive strategies.

Method: Introduces Composite Reasoning (CR) approach that allows LLMs to dynamically explore and combine multiple reasoning styles including deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning.

Result: Outperforms Chain-of-Thought and DeepSeek-R1 on scientific and medical QA benchmarks, with superior sample efficiency and token usage. Adaptively emphasizes domain-appropriate reasoning styles.

Conclusion: By cultivating internal reasoning style diversity, LLMs acquire more robust, adaptive, and efficient problem-solving abilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, rely on
singular, pre-dominant reasoning paradigms, hindering their performance on
intricate problems that demand diverse cognitive strategies. To address this,
we introduce Composite Reasoning (CR), a novel reasoning approach empowering
LLMs to dynamically explore and combine multiple reasoning styles like
deductive, inductive, and abductive for more nuanced problem-solving. Evaluated
on scientific and medical question-answering benchmarks, our approach
outperforms existing baselines like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and also surpasses
the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1 style reasoning (SR) capabilities, while
demonstrating superior sample efficiency and adequate token usage. Notably, CR
adaptively emphasizes domain-appropriate reasoning styles. It prioritizes
abductive and deductive reasoning for medical question answering, but shifts to
causal, deductive, and inductive methods for scientific reasoning. Our findings
highlight that by cultivating internal reasoning style diversity, LLMs acquire
more robust, adaptive, and efficient problem-solving abilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reverse Speculative Decoding (RSD) addresses reasoning transfer failures by having teachers propose tokens but students filter based on their own probability distributions, achieving 4.9% improvement vs 20.5% degradation from direct distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct distillation of reasoning traces from larger to smaller models often degrades performance due to distributional misalignment - teacher tokens exceed student's representation capacity.

Method: Proposed Reverse Speculative Decoding where teacher proposes candidate tokens but student determines acceptance based on its own probability distributions, filtering low probability tokens.

Result: Qwen3-0.6B trained on RSD-generated traces achieved 4.9% improvement vs 20.5% degradation from direct distillation; low probability tokens identified as critical bottleneck.

Conclusion: RSD enables effective reasoning transfer but traces are model-specific, requiring distributional alignment tailored to each student architecture's unique internal representation.

Abstract: Transferring reasoning capabilities from larger language models to smaller
ones through supervised fine-tuning often fails counterintuitively, with
performance degrading despite access to high-quality teacher demonstrations. We
identify that this failure stems from distributional misalignment: reasoning
traces from larger models contain tokens that are low probability under the
student's distribution, exceeding the internal representation capacity of
smaller architectures and creating learning barriers rather than helpful
guidance. We propose Reverse Speculative Decoding (RSD), a mechanism for
generating student-friendly reasoning traces in which the teacher model
proposes candidate tokens but the student model determines acceptance based on
its own probability distributions, filtering low probability tokens. When
applied to Qwen3-0.6B, direct distillation of s1K-1.1 reasoning trace data
degrades average performance across major reasoning benchmarks by 20.5\%, while
the same model trained on RSD-generated reasoning traces achieves meaningful
improvements of 4.9\%. Our analysis reveals that low probability tokens
constitute the critical bottleneck in reasoning ability transfer. However,
cross-model experiments demonstrate that RSD traces are model-specific rather
than universally applicable, indicating that distributional alignment must be
tailored for each student architecture's unique internal representation.

### [235] [FeatBench: Evaluating Coding Agents on Feature Implementation for Vibe Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22237)
*Haorui Chen,Chengze Li,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FeatBench is a novel benchmark for evaluating vibe coding capabilities in LLMs, focusing on feature implementation with pure natural language prompts, rigorous data collection, comprehensive testing, and diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for code generation are misaligned with vibe coding paradigm as they require code-level specifications or focus narrowly on issue-solving, neglecting feature implementation scenarios.

Method: FeatBench uses pure natural language prompts without code hints, employs multi-level filtering for quality data collection, automated pipeline to evolve benchmark, and includes Fail-to-Pass and Pass-to-Pass tests for verification.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art agent frameworks with leading LLMs shows feature implementation in vibe coding is challenging, with highest success rate only 29.94%. Analysis reveals 'aggressive implementation' strategy that leads to both failures and superior design.

Conclusion: Feature implementation within vibe coding paradigm remains a significant challenge, and FeatBench provides a comprehensive benchmark to facilitate further research in this area.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a
novel software development paradigm known as "vibe coding," where users
interact with coding agents through high-level natural language. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks for code generation inadequately assess an
agent's vibe coding capabilities. Existing benchmarks are misaligned, as they
either require code-level specifications or focus narrowly on issue-solving,
neglecting the critical scenario of feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradiam. To address this gap, we propose FeatBench, a novel benchmark
for vibe coding that focuses on feature implementation. Our benchmark is
distinguished by several key features: 1. Pure Natural Language Prompts. Task
inputs consist solely of abstract natural language descriptions, devoid of any
code or structural hints. 2. A Rigorous & Evolving Data Collection Process.
FeatBench is built on a multi-level filtering pipeline to ensure quality and a
fully automated pipeline to evolve the benchmark, mitigating data
contamination. 3. Comprehensive Test Cases. Each task includes Fail-to-Pass
(F2P) and Pass-to-Pass (P2P) tests to verify correctness and prevent
regressions. 4. Diverse Application Domains. The benchmark includes
repositories from diverse domains to ensure it reflects real-world scenarios.
We evaluate two state-of-the-art agent frameworks with four leading LLMs on
FeatBench. Our evaluation reveals that feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradigm is a significant challenge, with the highest success rate of
only 29.94%. Our analysis also reveals a tendency for "aggressive
implementation," a strategy that paradoxically leads to both critical failures
and superior software design. We release FeatBench, our automated collection
pipeline, and all experimental results to facilitate further community
research.

*Yuan Ge,Saihan Chen,Jingqi Xiao,Xiaoqian Liu,Tong Xiao,Yan Xiang,Zhengtao Yu,Jingbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FLEXI is the first benchmark for full-duplex LLM-human spoken interaction that evaluates latency, quality, and conversational effectiveness, revealing gaps between models in emergency awareness and interaction latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarking and modeling full-duplex speech-to-speech LLMs remains a fundamental challenge for natural human-computer interaction and real-time spoken dialogue systems.

Method: Introduced FLEXI benchmark with six diverse human-LLM interaction scenarios that explicitly incorporate model interruption in emergency scenarios, systematically evaluating latency, quality, and conversational effectiveness.

Result: Revealed significant gaps between open source and commercial models in emergency awareness, turn terminating, and interaction latency.

Conclusion: Next token-pair prediction offers a promising path toward achieving truly seamless and human-like full-duplex interaction.

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech-to-Speech Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling real-time spoken dialogue systems.
However, benchmarking and modeling these models remains a fundamental
challenge. We introduce FLEXI, the first benchmark for full-duplex LLM-human
spoken interaction that explicitly incorporates model interruption in emergency
scenarios. FLEXI systematically evaluates the latency, quality, and
conversational effectiveness of real-time dialogue through six diverse
human-LLM interaction scenarios, revealing significant gaps between open source
and commercial models in emergency awareness, turn terminating, and interaction
latency. Finally, we suggest that next token-pair prediction offers a promising
path toward achieving truly seamless and human-like full-duplex interaction.

### [237] [Safety Compliance: Rethinking LLM Safety Reasoning through the Lens of Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22250)
*Wenbin Hu,Huihao Jing,Haochen Shi,Haoran Li,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses LLM safety from legal compliance perspectives, developing a benchmark based on EU AI Act and GDPR, and creating a Compliance Reasoner using Group Policy Optimization that improves safety compliance by over 10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM safety methods lack systematic protection and rigorous standards, failing to ensure safety for complex modern LLM systems. The authors aim to bridge the gap between LLM safety and legal compliance.

Method: Developed a new safety compliance benchmark using realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with legal statutes, and aligned Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization (GRPO) to create a Compliance Reasoner.

Result: The Compliance Reasoner achieved superior performance with average improvements of +10.45% for EU AI Act compliance and +11.85% for GDPR compliance on the new benchmark.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges LLM safety with legal compliance frameworks, providing a systematic method to ensure LLM safety through established legal standards.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities, elevating the critical importance of LLM safety. However,
existing safety methods rely on ad-hoc taxonomy and lack a rigorous, systematic
protection, failing to ensure safety for the nuanced and complex behaviors of
modern LLM systems. To address this problem, we solve LLM safety from legal
compliance perspectives, named safety compliance. In this work, we posit
relevant established legal frameworks as safety standards for defining and
measuring safety compliance, including the EU AI Act and GDPR, which serve as
core legal frameworks for AI safety and data security in Europe. To bridge the
gap between LLM safety and legal compliance, we first develop a new benchmark
for safety compliance by generating realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with
legal statutes. Subsequently, we align Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to construct a safety reasoner, Compliance Reasoner, which effectively
aligns LLMs with legal standards to mitigate safety risks. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the Compliance Reasoner achieves superior
performance on the new benchmark, with average improvements of +10.45% for the
EU AI Act and +11.85% for GDPR.

### [238] [Beyond Textual Context: Structural Graph Encoding with Adaptive Space Alignment to alleviate the hallucination of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22251)
*Yifang Zhang,Pengfei Duan,Yiwen Yang,Shengwu Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSKG-LLM is a novel architecture that integrates both structural and semantic information from Knowledge Graphs into LLMs to address hallucination issues and improve factual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs treat KGs as plain text, extracting only semantic information while ignoring crucial structural aspects, and face embedding space gaps between KG encoders and LLMs.

Method: SSKG-LLM uses Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR), Knowledge Graph Encoding (KGE), and Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) modules to preserve semantics while utilizing structure and enable LLMs to understand KG embeddings.

Result: Extensive experiments show that incorporating structural information from KGs enhances LLMs' factual reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: SSKG-LLM effectively bridges the gap between KG structural information and LLM reasoning processes, improving factual accuracy and reducing hallucinations.

Abstract: Currently, the main approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the
hallucination issue is incorporating Knowledge Graphs(KGs).However, LLMs
typically treat KGs as plain text, extracting only semantic information and
limiting their use of the crucial structural aspects of KGs. Another challenge
is the gap between the embedding spaces of KGs encoders and LLMs text
embeddings, which hinders the effective integration of structured knowledge. To
overcome these obstacles, we put forward the SSKG-LLM, an innovative model
architecture that is designed to efficiently integrate both the Structural and
Semantic information of KGs into the reasoning processes of LLMs. SSKG-LLM
incorporates the Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) module and the Knowledge Graph
Encoding (KGE) module to preserve semantics while utilizing structure. Then,
the Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) module is incorporated to enable LLMs to
understand KGs embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments and provide a
detailed analysis to explore how incorporating the structural information of
KGs can enhance the factual reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code are available

### [239] [Bridging Fairness and Explainability: Can Input-Based Explanations Promote Fairness in Hate Speech Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22291)
*Yifan Wang,Mayank Jobanputra,Ji-Ung Lee,Soyoung Oh,Isabel Valera,Vera Demberg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper systematically studies how input-based explanations relate to fairness in hate speech detection models, finding they can detect bias and help reduce it during training but are unreliable for model selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP models often replicate social bias from training data, and their black-box nature makes it hard to recognize biased predictions or mitigate bias effectively. While some studies suggest explanations can help with bias detection and mitigation, there's limited large-scale quantitative analysis on this relationship.

Method: Conducted the first systematic study of explainability-fairness relationship in hate speech detection using both encoder- and decoder-only models. Examined three dimensions: identifying biased predictions, selecting fair models, and mitigating bias during training.

Result: Input-based explanations can effectively detect biased predictions and serve as useful supervision for reducing bias during training, but they are unreliable for selecting fair models among candidates.

Conclusion: While explanations are valuable for bias detection and mitigation in hate speech detection models, they should not be relied upon for fair model selection decisions.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) models often replicate or amplify social
bias from training data, raising concerns about fairness. At the same time,
their black-box nature makes it difficult for users to recognize biased
predictions and for developers to effectively mitigate them. While some studies
suggest that input-based explanations can help detect and mitigate bias, others
question their reliability in ensuring fairness. Existing research on
explainability in fair NLP has been predominantly qualitative, with limited
large-scale quantitative analysis. In this work, we conduct the first
systematic study of the relationship between explainability and fairness in
hate speech detection, focusing on both encoder- and decoder-only models. We
examine three key dimensions: (1) identifying biased predictions, (2) selecting
fair models, and (3) mitigating bias during model training. Our findings show
that input-based explanations can effectively detect biased predictions and
serve as useful supervision for reducing bias during training, but they are
unreliable for selecting fair models among candidates.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy in translating natural language to first-order logic, outperforming GPT-4o and symbolic systems, with predicate availability being crucial for performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating natural language to first-order logic translation is crucial for knowledge representation and formal methods but remains challenging, requiring systematic evaluation of LLM approaches.

Method: Systematic evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs using MALLS and Willow datasets, comparing architectures and training strategies including vocabulary extension, predicate conditioning, and multilingual training with specialized metrics.

Result: Fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate lists, outperforming GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1-0528, and symbolic systems. Predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%, T5 models surpass larger decoder-only LLMs, and models generalize to unseen logical arguments without specific training.

Conclusion: While structural logic translation proves robust, predicate extraction emerges as the main bottleneck in natural language to first-order logic translation systems.

Abstract: Automating the translation of natural language to first-order logic (FOL) is
crucial for knowledge representation and formal methods, yet remains
challenging. We present a systematic evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs for this
task, comparing architectures (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and training
strategies. Using the MALLS and Willow datasets, we explore techniques like
vocabulary extension, predicate conditioning, and multilingual training,
introducing metrics for exact match, logical equivalence, and predicate
alignment. Our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate
lists, outperforming GPT-4o and even the DeepSeek-R1-0528 model with CoT
reasoning ability as well as symbolic systems like ccg2lambda. Key findings
show: (1) predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%, (2) T5 models
surpass larger decoder-only LLMs, and (3) models generalize to unseen logical
arguments (FOLIO dataset) without specific training. While structural logic
translation proves robust, predicate extraction emerges as the main bottleneck.

### [241] [Transformers Can Learn Connectivity in Some Graphs but Not Others](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22343)
*Amit Roy,Abulhair Saparov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformers can learn transitive relations (graph connectivity) on grid-like directed graphs with low-dimensional embeddings, but struggle with complex graphs containing many disconnected components. Model scaling improves generalization for grid graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate transformers' capability to learn transitive relations from training data rather than just in-context examples, and understand how scaling affects this ability for graph connectivity tasks.

Method: Generated directed graphs to train transformer models of varying sizes, evaluated their ability to infer transitive relations (connectivity) for different graph sizes and structures, focusing on grid-like graphs vs. disconnected components.

Result: Transformers successfully learn connectivity on low-dimensional grid graphs where node embeddings can represent connectivity. Higher-dimensional grid graphs are more challenging. Model scaling improves generalization for grid graphs, but transformers struggle with graphs containing many disconnected components.

Conclusion: Transformers can learn transitive relations effectively for structured grid-like graphs with low-dimensional embeddings, but face limitations with complex graph structures containing many disconnected components, though scaling helps improve performance on structured graphs.

Abstract: Reasoning capability is essential to ensure the factual correctness of the
responses of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), and robust
reasoning about transitive relations is instrumental in many settings, such as
causal inference. Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of
transformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A
causes B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive
relations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,
knowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then
there is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can
learn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input
prompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from
training examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this
study, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train
transformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer
transitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that
transformers are capable of learning connectivity on "grid-like'' directed
graphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and
connectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that
the dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of
transformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional
grid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In
addition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly
better generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs. However, if the
graph is not a grid graph and contains many disconnected components,
transformers struggle to learn the connectivity task, especially when the
number of components is large.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper applies NLP to analyze religious invectives in Tudor England's Protestant Reformation, creating the InviTE corpus of 2000 annotated Early Modern English sentences and comparing fine-tuned BERT models with zero-shot LLMs for invective detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To apply NLP techniques to historical research, specifically studying religious invectives during the Protestant Reformation in Tudor England, addressing the need for computational analysis of historical language patterns.

Method: Developed a workflow from raw data to iterative annotation, created the InviTE corpus with expert annotations, and compared fine-tuned BERT-based models against zero-shot prompted LLMs for invective detection.

Result: Fine-tuned BERT models pre-trained on historical data outperformed zero-shot LLMs in detecting invective language, demonstrating the superiority of domain-specific fine-tuning over general-purpose language models.

Conclusion: Models pre-trained on historical data and fine-tuned specifically for invective detection achieve better performance than zero-shot LLMs, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation in historical NLP applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim at the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques to historical research endeavors, particularly addressing the study
of religious invectives in the context of the Protestant Reformation in Tudor
England. We outline a workflow spanning from raw data, through pre-processing
and data selection, to an iterative annotation process. As a result, we
introduce the InviTE corpus -- a corpus of almost 2000 Early Modern English
(EModE) sentences, which are enriched with expert annotations regarding
invective language throughout 16th-century England. Subsequently, we assess and
compare the performance of fine-tuned BERT-based models and zero-shot prompted
instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), which highlights the
superiority of models pre-trained on historical data and fine-tuned to
invective detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores applying Bayesian probability theory to relevance-theoretic pragmatics, focusing on how implicit meaning is communicated through conversational implicatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advances in Bayesian probability theory and computational tools have enabled a 'probabilistic turn' in pragmatics, building on frameworks like Rational Speech Act theory. The paper aims to extend this Bayesian approach to relevance-theoretic pragmatics.

Method: The study applies Bayesian methods to analyze how implicit meaning is communicated through conversational implicatures within the relevance-theoretic framework.

Result: The paper demonstrates how Bayesian probability theory can be effectively applied to model pragmatic phenomena in relevance-theoretic pragmatics, particularly for understanding implicit communication.

Conclusion: Bayesian approaches show promise for modeling pragmatic phenomena in relevance-theoretic frameworks, similar to their successful application in Rational Speech Act theory and other Gricean accounts.

Abstract: Recent advances in Bayesian probability theory and its application to
cognitive science in combination with the development of a new generation of
computational tools and methods for probabilistic computation have led to a
'probabilistic turn' in pragmatics and semantics. In particular, the framework
of Rational Speech Act theory has been developed to model broadly Gricean
accounts of pragmatic phenomena in Bayesian terms, starting with fairly simple
reference games and covering ever more complex communicative exchanges such as
verbal syllogistic reasoning. This paper explores in which way a similar
Bayesian approach might be applied to relevance-theoretic pragmatics (Sperber &
Wilson, 1995) by study a paradigmatic pragmatic phenomenon: the communication
of implicit meaning by ways of (conversational) implicatures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CHRONOBERG is a temporally structured corpus of English books spanning 250 years, designed to study linguistic evolution and improve LLMs' ability to handle diachronic language variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing corpora lack long-term temporal structure, limiting LLMs' ability to understand semantic and normative evolution of language over time.

Method: Curated books from Project Gutenberg with temporal annotations, used VAD analysis to quantify lexical semantic change, and created historically calibrated affective lexicons.

Result: Modern LLMs struggle with diachronic meaning shifts and need better temporal contextualization for detecting discriminatory language and sentiment across different time periods.

Conclusion: CHRONOBERG serves as a scalable resource for studying linguistic change and emphasizes the need for temporally aware training and evaluation pipelines in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at operating at scale by leveraging social
media and various data crawled from the web. Whereas existing corpora are
diverse, their frequent lack of long-term temporal structure may however limit
an LLM's ability to contextualize semantic and normative evolution of language
and to capture diachronic variation. To support analysis and training for the
latter, we introduce CHRONOBERG, a temporally structured corpus of English book
texts spanning 250 years, curated from Project Gutenberg and enriched with a
variety of temporal annotations. First, the edited nature of books enables us
to quantify lexical semantic change through time-sensitive
Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) analysis and to construct historically
calibrated affective lexicons to support temporally grounded interpretation.
With the lexicons at hand, we demonstrate a need for modern LLM-based tools to
better situate their detection of discriminatory language and contextualization
of sentiment across various time-periods. In fact, we show how language models
trained sequentially on CHRONOBERG struggle to encode diachronic shifts in
meaning, emphasizing the need for temporally aware training and evaluation
pipelines, and positioning CHRONOBERG as a scalable resource for the study of
linguistic change and temporal generalization. Disclaimer: This paper includes
language and display of samples that could be offensive to readers. Open

*Max Malyi,Jonathan Shek,Andre Biscaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs are used to perform deep semantic analysis on wind turbine maintenance logs, moving beyond simple classification to generate actionable insights through four analytical workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods only classify maintenance logs, missing the rich operational intelligence locked in unstructured text. There's a gap in using LLMs for complex reasoning tasks in reliability analysis.

Method: An exploratory framework using LLMs to perform semantic analysis through four workflows: failure mode identification, causal chain inference, comparative site analysis, and data quality auditing.

Result: LLMs successfully function as "reliability co-pilots," synthesizing textual information and generating expert-level hypotheses from maintenance data.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reproducible methodology for using LLMs as reasoning tools, unlocking previously obscured insights in unstructured wind energy maintenance data.

Abstract: A wealth of operational intelligence is locked within the unstructured
free-text of wind turbine maintenance logs, a resource largely inaccessible to
traditional quantitative reliability analysis. While machine learning has been
applied to this data, existing approaches typically stop at classification,
categorising text into predefined labels. This paper addresses the gap in
leveraging modern large language models (LLMs) for more complex reasoning
tasks. We introduce an exploratory framework that uses LLMs to move beyond
classification and perform deep semantic analysis. We apply this framework to a
large industrial dataset to execute four analytical workflows: failure mode
identification, causal chain inference, comparative site analysis, and data
quality auditing. The results demonstrate that LLMs can function as powerful
"reliability co-pilots," moving beyond labelling to synthesise textual
information and generate actionable, expert-level hypotheses. This work
contributes a novel and reproducible methodology for using LLMs as a reasoning
tool, offering a new pathway to enhance operational intelligence in the wind
energy sector by unlocking insights previously obscured in unstructured data.

*Tanise Ceron,Dmitry Nikolaev,Dominik Stammbach,Debora Nozza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of OLMO2's training data reveals left-leaning political bias predominates in LLM training corpora, with pre-training data containing more politically engaged content than post-training data, and this bias strongly correlates with models' political stances on policy issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how political biases arise in large language models by analyzing their training data, which remains largely unexplored in current LLM research.

Method: Analyzed pre- and post-training corpora of OLMO2 (largest fully open-source model), drew large random samples, automatically annotated documents for political orientation, analyzed source domains and content, and assessed correlation with models' policy stances.

Result: Left-leaning documents predominate across datasets; pre-training corpora contain significantly more politically engaged content than post-training data; left- and right-leaning documents frame similar topics through distinct values and legitimacy sources; predominant training data stance strongly correlates with models' political biases on policy issues.

Conclusion: Political content analysis should be integrated into future data curation pipelines and filtering strategies should be thoroughly documented for transparency to address political biases in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to generate politically biased text,
yet how such biases arise remains unclear. A crucial step toward answering this
question is the analysis of training data, whose political content remains
largely underexplored in current LLM research. To address this gap, we present
in this paper an analysis of the pre- and post-training corpora of OLMO2, the
largest fully open-source model released together with its complete dataset.
From these corpora, we draw large random samples, automatically annotate
documents for political orientation, and analyze their source domains and
content. We then assess how political content in the training data correlates
with models' stance on specific policy issues. Our analysis shows that
left-leaning documents predominate across datasets, with pre-training corpora
containing significantly more politically engaged content than post-training
data. We also find that left- and right-leaning documents frame similar topics
through distinct values and sources of legitimacy. Finally, the predominant
stance in the training data strongly correlates with models' political biases
when evaluated on policy issues. These findings underscore the need to
integrate political content analysis into future data curation pipelines as
well as in-depth documentation of filtering strategies for transparency.

*Ziheng Chi,Yifan Hou,Chenxi Pang,Shaobo Cui,Mubashara Akhtar,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Chimera, a comprehensive test suite of 7,500 Wikipedia diagrams to evaluate genuine diagram comprehension in vision-language models, revealing that current VLMs rely heavily on shortcuts rather than true understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models appear to perform well on diagram benchmarks but may rely on shortcuts like memorization, knowledge recall, and language patterns rather than genuine diagram comprehension, creating a need for more robust evaluation.

Method: Created Chimera test suite with 7,500 Wikipedia diagrams annotated with semantic triples and multi-level questions assessing entity recognition, relation understanding, knowledge grounding, and visual reasoning. Evaluated 15 VLMs from 7 families to measure three shortcut types.

Result: VLMs' strong performance on diagrams largely stems from shortcut behaviors: visual-memorization shortcuts have slight impact, knowledge-recall shortcuts play moderate role, and Clever-Hans shortcuts contribute significantly to performance.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have critical limitations in genuine diagram comprehension, relying heavily on shortcuts. This underscores the need for more robust evaluation protocols that benchmark true understanding of complex visual inputs rather than question-answering shortcuts.

Abstract: Diagrams convey symbolic information in a visual format rather than a linear
stream of words, making them especially challenging for AI models to process.
While recent evaluations suggest that vision-language models (VLMs) perform
well on diagram-related benchmarks, their reliance on knowledge, reasoning, or
modality shortcuts raises concerns about whether they genuinely understand and
reason over diagrams. To address this gap, we introduce Chimera, a
comprehensive test suite comprising 7,500 high-quality diagrams sourced from
Wikipedia; each diagram is annotated with its symbolic content represented by
semantic triples along with multi-level questions designed to assess four
fundamental aspects of diagram comprehension: entity recognition, relation
understanding, knowledge grounding, and visual reasoning. We use Chimera to
measure the presence of three types of shortcuts in visual question answering:
(1) the visual-memorization shortcut, where VLMs rely on memorized visual
patterns; (2) the knowledge-recall shortcut, where models leverage memorized
factual knowledge instead of interpreting the diagram; and (3) the Clever-Hans
shortcut, where models exploit superficial language patterns or priors without
true comprehension. We evaluate 15 open-source VLMs from 7 model families on
Chimera and find that their seemingly strong performance largely stems from
shortcut behaviors: visual-memorization shortcuts have slight impact,
knowledge-recall shortcuts play a moderate role, and Clever-Hans shortcuts
contribute significantly. These findings expose critical limitations in current
VLMs and underscore the need for more robust evaluation protocols that
benchmark genuine comprehension of complex visual inputs (e.g., diagrams)
rather than question-answering shortcuts.

### [248] [Detecting (Un)answerability in Large Language Models with Linear Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22449)
*Maor Juliet Lavi,Tova Milo,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for detecting unanswerable questions in extractive QA by identifying a direction in LLM activation space that captures unanswerability, enabling reliable classification and control of abstention behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often respond confidently even when lacking necessary information, leading to hallucinated answers, which motivates the need for reliable unanswerability detection in extractive QA.

Method: Propose identifying a direction in model's activation space that captures unanswerability by applying activation additions during inference and measuring impact on abstention behavior, then projecting hidden activations onto this direction for classification.

Result: Method effectively detects unanswerable questions, generalizes better across datasets than existing approaches, extends beyond extractive QA to other unanswerability factors, and causal interventions show the direction effectively controls abstention behavior.

Conclusion: The identified activation direction provides a reliable and generalizable approach for unanswerability detection that can control model abstention behavior across various types of unanswerable questions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often respond confidently to questions even when
they lack the necessary information, leading to hallucinated answers. In this
work, we study the problem of (un)answerability detection, focusing on
extractive question answering (QA) where the model should determine if a
passage contains sufficient information to answer a given question. We propose
a simple approach for identifying a direction in the model's activation space
that captures unanswerability and uses it for classification. This direction is
selected by applying activation additions during inference and measuring their
impact on the model's abstention behavior. We show that projecting hidden
activations onto this direction yields a reliable score for (un)answerability
classification. Experiments on two open-weight LLMs and four extractive QA
benchmarks show that our method effectively detects unanswerable questions and
generalizes better across datasets than existing prompt-based and
classifier-based approaches. Moreover, the obtained directions extend beyond
extractive QA to unanswerability that stems from factors, such as lack of
scientific consensus and subjectivity. Last, causal interventions show that
adding or ablating the directions effectively controls the abstention behavior

### [249] [Evaluating the Limits of Large Language Models in Multilingual Legal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22472)
*Antreas Ioannou,Andreas Shiamishis,Nora Hollenstein,Nezihe Merve Gürel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLMs (LLaMA and Gemini) on multilingual legal benchmarks, finding they struggle with legal tasks (accuracy <50%) compared to general tasks (>70%). It also assesses adversarial robustness and presents an open-source evaluation pipeline for legal AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in legal workflows, there's a need to understand their capabilities and limitations in multilingual, jurisdictionally diverse, and adversarial contexts, which remain insufficiently explored.

Method: Evaluated LLaMA and Gemini on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks using LLM-as-a-Judge approach. Assessed adversarial robustness through character and word-level perturbations. Developed an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline for multilingual legal task benchmarking.

Result: Legal tasks pose significant challenges with accuracies often below 50% on legal reasoning benchmarks, compared to over 70% on general-purpose tasks. LLaMA is weaker than Gemini (24 percentage point advantage for Gemini). English doesn't always yield higher accuracy, and performance correlates with syntactic similarity to English.

Conclusion: Despite improvements in newer LLMs, challenges remain in deploying them reliably for critical, multilingual legal applications due to persistent prompt sensitivity, adversarial vulnerability, and performance gaps in legal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: In an era dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), understanding their
capabilities and limitations, especially in high-stakes fields like law, is
crucial. While LLMs such as Meta's LLaMA, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini,
DeepSeek, and other emerging models are increasingly integrated into legal
workflows, their performance in multilingual, jurisdictionally diverse, and
adversarial contexts remains insufficiently explored. This work evaluates LLaMA
and Gemini on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks, and assesses their
adversarial robustness in legal tasks through character and word-level
perturbations. We use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation.
We moreover present an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline designed to
support multilingual, task-diverse benchmarking of any combination of LLMs and
datasets, with a particular focus on legal tasks, including classification,
summarization, open questions, and general reasoning. Our findings confirm that
legal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below
50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on
general-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields
more stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt
sensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across
languages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a
language and its syntactic similarity to English. We also observe that LLaMA is
weaker than Gemini, with the latter showing an average advantage of about 24
percentage points across the same task. Despite improvements in newer LLMs,
challenges remain in deploying them reliably for critical, multilingual legal
applications.

*Yuqing Zhang,Ecesu Ürker,Tessa Verhoef,Gemma Boleda,Arianna Bisazza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeLLCom-Lex is a neural-agent framework that simulates semantic change by grounding agents in real lexical systems and manipulating their communicative needs, showing that neural agents can reproduce human-like color naming patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for studying lexical semantic change (observational corpus analysis and experimental paradigms) cannot capture causal mechanisms or handle extended diachronic processes effectively.

Method: A neural-agent framework using color naming tasks, where agents are trained with supervised and reinforcement learning pipelines to 'speak' existing languages and adapt to communicative needs.

Result: Neural agents trained on existing languages can reproduce human-like patterns in color naming to a remarkable extent, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: NeLLCom-Lex supports further investigation into the mechanisms of semantic change through neural agent simulations.

Abstract: Lexical semantic change has primarily been investigated with observational
and experimental methods; however, observational methods (corpus analysis,
distributional semantic modeling) cannot get at causal mechanisms, and
experimental paradigms with humans are hard to apply to semantic change due to
the extended diachronic processes involved. This work introduces NeLLCom-Lex, a
neural-agent framework designed to simulate semantic change by first grounding
agents in a real lexical system (e.g. English) and then systematically
manipulating their communicative needs. Using a well-established color naming
task, we simulate the evolution of a lexical system within a single generation,
and study which factors lead agents to: (i) develop human-like naming behavior
and lexicons, and (ii) change their behavior and lexicons according to their
communicative needs. Our experiments with different supervised and
reinforcement learning pipelines show that neural agents trained to 'speak' an
existing language can reproduce human-like patterns in color naming to a
remarkable extent, supporting the further use of NeLLCom-Lex to elucidate the
mechanisms of semantic change.

*Hang Li,Kaiqi Yang,Yucheng Chu,Hui Liu,Jiliang Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Solution divergence in LLM-generated answers correlates with better problem-solving performance and can be used to improve training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how the diversity of solutions generated by LLMs for the same problem relates to their problem-solving capabilities, moving beyond traditional SFT and RL approaches.

Method: Proposed solution divergence as a novel metric to evaluate and enhance LLM training, testing it across three problem domains to support both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning strategies.

Result: Higher solution divergence was consistently linked to improved success rates in problem-solving tasks across various models and domains.

Conclusion: Solution divergence is a simple yet effective tool that can advance LLM training and evaluation methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for problem-solving tasks.
Most recent work improves their performance through supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with labeled data or reinforcement learning (RL) from task feedback. In
this paper, we study a new perspective: the divergence in solutions generated
by LLMs for a single problem. We show that higher solution divergence is
positively related to better problem-solving abilities across various models.
Based on this finding, we propose solution divergence as a novel metric that
can support both SFT and RL strategies. We test this idea on three
representative problem domains and find that using solution divergence
consistently improves success rates. These results suggest that solution
divergence is a simple but effective tool for advancing LLM training and
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The JGU Mainz team submitted models for WMT25 Shared Task on LLMs with limited resources for Slavic languages, achieving better performance than baselines on machine translation and question answering tasks for Ukrainian, Upper Sorbian, and Lower Sorbian.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of developing effective language models for Slavic languages with limited computational resources, specifically focusing on machine translation and question answering tasks.

Method: Jointly fine-tuned Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct models for both tasks using parameter-efficient finetuning, integrated additional translation and QA data, used retrieval-augmented generation for Ukrainian QA, and applied ensembling for Upper and Lower Sorbian QA.

Result: The developed models outperformed the baseline models on both machine translation and question answering tasks for all three target languages.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that effective models for Slavic languages can be developed with limited resources through joint task finetuning, data integration, and specialized techniques like retrieval-augmented generation and ensembling.

Abstract: This paper presents the JGU Mainz submission to the WMT25 Shared Task on LLMs

Answering, focusing on Ukrainian, Upper Sorbian, and Lower Sorbian. For each
language, we jointly fine-tune a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model for both tasks with
parameter-efficient finetuning. Our pipeline integrates additional translation
and multiple-choice question answering (QA) data. For Ukrainian QA, we further
use retrieval-augmented generation. We also apply ensembling for QA in Upper

both tasks.

### [253] [Representing LLMs in Prompt Semantic Task Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22506)
*Idan Kashani,Avi Mendelson,Yaniv Nemcovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A training-free method to represent LLMs as linear operators in semantic task space for efficient model selection and performance prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for LLM selection have limited scalability, require costly retraining, and produce non-interpretable representations, making it hard to identify the best-performing LLM for specific tasks.

Method: Represents LLMs as linear operators within prompts' semantic task space using closed-form computation of geometrical properties, eliminating the need for training and enabling real-time adaptability.

Result: Achieves competitive or state-of-the-art results on success prediction and model selection tasks, with notable performance in out-of-sample scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free approach provides highly interpretable LLM representations with exceptional scalability and real-time adaptability to dynamic model repositories.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results over various tasks,
and ever-expanding public repositories contain an abundance of pre-trained
models. Therefore, identifying the best-performing LLM for a given task is a
significant challenge. Previous works have suggested learning LLM
representations to address this. However, these approaches present limited
scalability and require costly retraining to encompass additional models and
datasets. Moreover, the produced representation utilizes distinct spaces that
cannot be easily interpreted. This work presents an efficient, training-free
approach to representing LLMs as linear operators within the prompts' semantic
task space, thus providing a highly interpretable representation of the models'
application. Our method utilizes closed-form computation of geometrical
properties and ensures exceptional scalability and real-time adaptability to
dynamically expanding repositories. We demonstrate our approach on success
prediction and model selection tasks, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art
results with notable performance in out-of-sample scenarios.

### [254] [We Think, Therefore We Align LLMs to Helpful, Harmless and Honest Before They Go Wrong](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22510)
*Gautam Siddharth Kashyap,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMBS is a two-stage 1-to-N framework that enables unified multi-objective alignment of LLMs across helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty objectives while preventing catastrophic forgetting and maintaining cross-objective consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current steering vector approaches either cause catastrophic forgetting (1-to-1) or inference fragmentation (naive 1-to-N), making it challenging to align LLMs across multiple objectives like HHH without compromising consistency.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage I computes shared post-attention hidden states once, Stage II clones this representation into parallel branches with policy-reference mechanism for objective-specific steering while maintaining consistency.

Result: AMBS improves average HHH alignment scores by +32.4% and reduces unsafe outputs by 11.0% on DeepSeek-7B compared to naive 1-to-N baseline, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: AMBS provides an effective solution for multi-objective LLM alignment that balances performance across objectives while maintaining consistency, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) along multiple
objectives-helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (HHH)-is critical for safe
and reliable deployment. Prior work has used steering vector-small control
signals injected into hidden states-to guide LLM outputs, typically via
one-to-one (1-to-1) Transformer decoders. In this setting, optimizing a single
alignment objective can inadvertently overwrite representations learned for
other objectives, leading to catastrophic forgetting. More recent approaches
extend steering vectors via one-to-many (1-to-N) Transformer decoders. While
this alleviates catastrophic forgetting, naive multi-branch designs optimize
each objective independently, which can cause inference fragmentation-outputs
across HHH objectives may become inconsistent. We propose Adaptive Multi-Branch
Steering (AMBS), a two-stage 1-to-N framework for unified and efficient
multi-objective alignment. In Stage I, post-attention hidden states of the
Transformer layer are computed once to form a shared representation. In Stage
II, this representation is cloned into parallel branches and steered via a
policy-reference mechanism, enabling objective-specific control while
maintaining cross-objective consistency. Empirical evaluations on Alpaca,
BeaverTails, and TruthfulQA show that AMBS consistently improves HHH alignment
across multiple 7B LLM backbones. For example, on DeepSeek-7B, AMBS improves
average alignment scores by +32.4% and reduces unsafe outputs by 11.0% compared
to a naive 1-to-N baseline, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An end-to-end FP8 training recipe that enables efficient LLM training with 22% faster training, 14% lower memory usage, and 19% higher throughput while maintaining performance parity with BF16 baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models presents a major barrier to innovation, and while FP8 training offers theoretical efficiency gains, its adoption has been hindered by lack of comprehensive open-source training recipes.

Method: Fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy that seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning to maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency.

Result: The FP8 training recipe is remarkably stable and essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with BF16 baseline across reasoning benchmarks, with 22% reduction in training time, 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and 19% increase in throughput.

Conclusion: FP8 is established as a practical and robust alternative to BF16 for large-scale model training, with code release to democratize adoption.

Abstract: The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents a major barrier to innovation. While FP8 training offers a promising
solution with significant theoretical efficiency gains, its widespread adoption
has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive, open-source training recipe.
To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that
seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our
methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to
maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through
extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a
160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable
but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16
baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved
with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in
training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in
throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to
BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize
large-scale model training.

*Jinfeng Zhou,Zheyu Chen,Shuai Wang,Quanyu Dai,Zhenhua Dong,Hongning Wang,Minlie Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cognitive Reasoning, a new paradigm for social cognition in LLMs, and CogFlow framework that implements it through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to improve social decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs excel at logical reasoning but struggle with social situations that require interpretive processes of ambiguous cues rather than definitive answers.

Method: Proposes CogFlow framework: 1) Creates cognitive flow dataset via tree-structured planning simulating human thought, 2) Uses supervised fine-tuning to instill basic cognitive reasoning, 3) Applies reinforcement learning with multi-objective reward for cognitive flow and response quality.

Result: Extensive experiments show CogFlow effectively enhances social cognitive capabilities of LLMs and even humans, leading to more effective social decision-making.

Conclusion: Cognitive Reasoning paradigm and CogFlow framework successfully bridge the gap between logical reasoning and social cognition in AI systems.

Abstract: LLMs trained for logical reasoning excel at step-by-step deduction to reach
verifiable answers. However, this paradigm is ill-suited for navigating social
situations, which induce an interpretive process of analyzing ambiguous cues
that rarely yield a definitive outcome. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Cognitive Reasoning, a paradigm modeled on human social cognition. It
formulates the interpretive process into a structured cognitive flow of
interconnected cognitive units (e.g., observation or attribution), which
combine adaptively to enable effective social thinking and responses. We then
propose CogFlow, a complete framework that instills this capability in LLMs.
CogFlow first curates a dataset of cognitive flows by simulating the
associative and progressive nature of human thought via tree-structured
planning. After instilling the basic cognitive reasoning capability via
supervised fine-tuning, CogFlow adopts reinforcement learning to enable the
model to improve itself via trial and error, guided by a multi-objective reward
that optimizes both cognitive flow and response quality. Extensive experiments
show that CogFlow effectively enhances the social cognitive capabilities of
LLMs, and even humans, leading to more effective social decision-making.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for evaluating LLM-generated draft responses to patient messages using retrieval-augmented context and hierarchical error detection to improve clinical accuracy and workflow appropriateness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Asynchronous patient-clinician messaging via EHR portals is increasing clinician workload, and LLM-generated draft responses may contain clinical inaccuracies, omissions, or tone mismatches, requiring robust evaluation methods.

Method: Developed a clinically grounded error ontology with 5 domains and 59 error codes, created a retrieval-augmented evaluation pipeline (RAEC) using semantically similar historical message-response pairs, and implemented a two-stage DSPy prompting architecture for hierarchical error detection.

Result: Retrieval context improved error identification in clinical completeness and workflow appropriateness domains. Human validation showed superior agreement (50% vs 33%) and performance (F1 = 0.500 vs 0.256) compared to baseline evaluation without context.

Conclusion: The RAEC pipeline serves as effective AI guardrails for patient messaging by leveraging historical context to enhance evaluation quality and reduce clinical errors in LLM-generated responses.

Abstract: Asynchronous patient-clinician messaging via EHR portals is a growing source
of clinician workload, prompting interest in large language models (LLMs) to
assist with draft responses. However, LLM outputs may contain clinical
inaccuracies, omissions, or tone mismatches, making robust evaluation
essential. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a clinically
grounded error ontology comprising 5 domains and 59 granular error codes,
developed through inductive coding and expert adjudication; (2) we develop a
retrieval-augmented evaluation pipeline (RAEC) that leverages semantically
similar historical message-response pairs to improve judgment quality; and (3)
we provide a two-stage prompting architecture using DSPy to enable scalable,
interpretable, and hierarchical error detection. Our approach assesses the
quality of drafts both in isolation and with reference to similar past
message-response pairs retrieved from institutional archives. Using a two-stage
DSPy pipeline, we compared baseline and reference-enhanced evaluations on over
1,500 patient messages. Retrieval context improved error identification in
domains such as clinical completeness and workflow appropriateness. Human
validation on 100 messages demonstrated superior agreement (concordance = 50%
vs. 33%) and performance (F1 = 0.500 vs. 0.256) of context-enhanced labels vs.
baseline, supporting the use of our RAEC pipeline as AI guardrails for patient
messaging.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle to localize context-grounded hallucinations, achieving only 0.67 F1 score on a new benchmark, with key challenges being tendency to flag missing details as inconsistent and difficulty with outputs containing correct but unsourced information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study LLMs' capability for localizing context-grounded hallucinations as a practical alternative to complex evaluation pipelines, addressing the lack of established benchmarks for meta-evaluation.

Method: Created a challenging benchmark with 1,000+ human-annotated examples, proposed free-form textual descriptions for error representation, evaluated four large-scale LLMs with various prompting strategies.

Result: Best model achieved only 0.67 F1 score, showing the benchmark's difficulty. LLMs tend to incorrectly flag missing details as inconsistent and struggle with outputs containing factually correct but unsourced information.

Conclusion: LLMs face significant challenges in hallucination localization due to systematic error patterns, with careful prompting strategies needed but current performance remains limited.

Abstract: Context-grounded hallucinations are cases where model outputs contain
information not verifiable against the source text. We study the applicability
of LLMs for localizing such hallucinations, as a more practical alternative to
existing complex evaluation pipelines. In the absence of established benchmarks
for meta-evaluation of hallucinations localization, we construct one tailored
to LLMs, involving a challenging human annotation of over 1,000 examples. We
complement the benchmark with an LLM-based evaluation protocol, verifying its
quality in a human evaluation. Since existing representations of hallucinations
limit the types of errors that can be expressed, we propose a new
representation based on free-form textual descriptions, capturing the full
range of possible errors. We conduct a comprehensive study, evaluating four
large-scale LLMs, which highlights the benchmark's difficulty, as the best
model achieves an F1 score of only 0.67. Through careful analysis, we offer
insights into optimal prompting strategies for the task and identify the main
factors that make it challenging for LLMs: (1) a tendency to incorrectly flag
missing details as inconsistent, despite being instructed to check only facts
in the output; and (2) difficulty with outputs containing factually correct
information absent from the source - and thus not verifiable - due to alignment
with the model's parametric knowledge.

Motivation: To establish that subregular language classes provide a rigorous and interpretable foundation for modeling natural language structure through linear separability.

Method: Representing subregular language classes by their deciding predicates and using linear models for learning, with validation through synthetic experiments and real-data experiments on English morphology.

Result: Perfect separability under noise-free conditions in synthetic experiments, and learned features align with well-known linguistic constraints in real-data experiments.

Method: Collected opinions from diverse individuals to create a self-sourced dataset, simulated deliberation using product presentations with striking facts, and compared multiple NLP techniques including Frequency-Based Discourse Modulation and Quantum-Deliberation Framework.

Result: Frequency-Based Discourse Modulation and Quantum-Deliberation Framework outperformed existing state-of-the-art models in interpreting deliberative discourse and producing meaningful insights about opinion shifts.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates practical applications in public policy-making, debate evaluation, decision-support frameworks, and large-scale social media opinion mining, showing the effectiveness of advanced NLP techniques in modeling deliberation processes.

Abstract: Deliberation plays a crucial role in shaping outcomes by weighing diverse

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To properly quantify uncertainty and statistical precision of evaluation metrics in multilingual/multitask NLP benchmarks, as experimental variation arises from both model- and data-related sources.

Method: Resampling-based methods that account for both model- and data-related sources of variation in performance scores.

Result: The methods avoid substantially underestimating overall variability over hypothetical replications and are useful for computing sampling distributions for leaderboard quantities like averages, pairwise differences, and rankings.

Conclusion: Resampling methods are effective for comprehensive uncertainty quantification in multilingual/multitask NLP evaluation, providing proper statistical precision estimates for benchmark comparisons.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a set of resampling-based methods for quantifying
uncertainty and statistical precision of evaluation metrics in multilingual
and/or multitask NLP benchmarks. We show how experimental variation in
performance scores arises from both model- and data-related sources, and that
accounting for both of them is necessary to avoid substantially underestimating
the overall variability over hypothetical replications. Using multilingual
question answering, machine translation, and named entity recognition as
example tasks, we also demonstrate how resampling methods are useful for
computing sampling distributions for various quantities used in leaderboards
such as the average/median, pairwise differences between models, and rankings.

*Xingyu Shen,Yingfa Chen,Zhen Leng Thai,Xu Han,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StateX is a post-training pipeline that efficiently expands the recurrent state size of pre-trained RNNs (linear attention and state space models) to improve their recall and in-context learning abilities without significant parameter increases or high training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models have high computational costs for long contexts, while RNNs with constant per-token complexity struggle with accurate recall from long contexts due to limited state size. Training RNNs with larger states from scratch is expensive.

Method: Post-training architectural modifications for linear attention and state space models to scale up state size with minimal parameter increase, applied to pre-trained models up to 1.3B parameters.

Result: StateX efficiently enhances recall and in-context learning abilities of RNNs without high post-training costs or compromising other capabilities.

Conclusion: StateX provides an effective solution to improve RNNs' long-context processing capabilities through efficient post-training state expansion, bridging the gap between RNN efficiency and Transformer performance.

Abstract: While Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable language modeling
performance, their high complexities result in high costs when processing long
contexts. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as linear
attention and state space models have gained popularity due to their constant
per-token complexities. However, these recurrent models struggle with tasks
that require accurate recall of contextual information from long contexts,
because all contextual information is compressed into a constant-size recurrent
state. Previous works have shown that recall ability is positively correlated
with the recurrent state size, yet directly training RNNs with larger recurrent
states results in high training costs. In this paper, we introduce StateX, a
training pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNs
through post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention and
state space models, we design post-training architectural modifications to
scale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters.
Experiments on models up to 1.3B parameters demonstrate that StateX efficiently
enhances the recall and in-context learning ability of RNNs without incurring
high post-training costs or compromising other capabilities.

*Xiangxin Zhou,Zichen Liu,Haonan Wang,Chao Du,Min Lin,Chongxuan Li,Liang Wang,Tianyu Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A variational reasoning framework that treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through variational inference, unifying variational inference with RL-style methods for improving language model reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled probabilistic perspective that unifies variational inference with reinforcement learning methods for improving language model reasoning abilities.

Method: Extends evidence lower bound (ELBO) to multi-trace objective for tighter bounds, proposes forward-KL formulation for stable training, and shows connections between rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL as local forward-KL objectives.

Result: Empirically validated on Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across various reasoning tasks, revealing previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions through implicit weighting by model accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework provides stable objectives for improving reasoning ability and unifies variational inference with RL-style methods from a probabilistic perspective.

Abstract: We introduce a variational reasoning framework for language models that
treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through
variational inference. Starting from the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we extend
it to a multi-trace objective for tighter bounds and propose a forward-KL
formulation that stabilizes the training of the variational posterior. We
further show that rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL, including
GRPO, can be interpreted as local forward-KL objectives, where an implicit
weighting by model accuracy naturally arises from the derivation and reveals a
previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions. We empirically validate our
method on the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across a wide range of
reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides a principled probabilistic
perspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields
stable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models. Our

### [265] [Language Models Can Learn from Verbal Feedback Without Scalar Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22638)
*Renjie Luo,Zichen Liu,Xiangyan Liu,Chao Du,Min Lin,Wenhu Chen,Wei Lu,Tianyu Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a feedback-conditional policy (FCP) that treats verbal feedback as a conditioning signal for LLMs, reframing feedback-driven learning as conditional generation rather than reward optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding richness and causing scale imbalance. The authors aim to preserve the full expressiveness of verbal feedback.

Method: FCP learns from response-feedback pairs using maximum likelihood training on offline data, then uses online bootstrapping where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh feedback for refinement.

Result: The approach enables LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback in a more expressive way, treating feedback as a conditioning signal rather than compressing it into rewards.

Conclusion: Reframing feedback-driven learning as conditional generation offers a more expressive alternative to reward optimization for LLMs learning from verbal feedback.

Abstract: LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methods
typically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much of
their richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbal
feedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image
generation, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the
feedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback
pairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum
likelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping
stage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh
feedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as
conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more
expressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback. Our code is
available at https://github.com/sail-sg/feedback-conditional-policy.

### [266] [Death of the Novel(ty): Beyond n-Gram Novelty as a Metric for Textual Creativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22641)
*Arkadiy Saakyan,Najoung Kim,Smaranda Muresan,Tuhin Chakrabarty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: N-gram novelty alone is insufficient for measuring creativity as it ignores appropriateness. Expert annotations show that while n-gram novelty correlates with creativity, 91% of top-novelty expressions aren't creative. LLMs struggle with pragmaticality at high novelty levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the adequacy of n-gram novelty as a creativity metric, since creativity requires both novelty and appropriateness, which n-gram novelty doesn't capture.

Method: Used 7542 expert writer annotations (26 annotators) evaluating novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality of human and AI-generated text. Tested zero-shot, few-shot, and finetuned models on identifying creative and non-pragmatic expressions.

Result: N-gram novelty positively correlates with creativity but 91% of top-novelty expressions aren't creative. LLMs show lower pragmaticality at higher novelty. Frontier LLMs perform better than random but struggle with non-pragmatic expressions. LLM-as-a-Judge novelty scores predict expert preferences.

Conclusion: N-gram novelty alone is insufficient for measuring creativity. LLMs need improvement in generating and identifying creative expressions, especially in maintaining pragmaticality at high novelty levels.

Abstract: N-gram novelty is widely used to evaluate language models' ability to
generate text outside of their training data. More recently, it has also been
adopted as a metric for measuring textual creativity. However, theoretical work
on creativity suggests that this approach may be inadequate, as it does not
account for creativity's dual nature: novelty (how original the text is) and
appropriateness (how sensical and pragmatic it is). We investigate the
relationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542
expert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality
via close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gram
novelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% of
top-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative,
cautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone. Furthermore, unlike
human-written text, higher n-gram novelty in open-source LLMs correlates with
lower pragmaticality. In an exploratory study with frontier close-source
models, we additionally confirm that they are less likely to produce creative
expressions than humans. Using our dataset, we test whether zero-shot,
few-shot, and finetuned models are able to identify creative expressions (a
positive aspect of writing) and non-pragmatic ones (a negative aspect).
Overall, frontier LLMs exhibit performance much higher than random but leave
room for improvement, especially struggling to identify non-pragmatic
expressions. We further find that LLM-as-a-Judge novelty scores from the
best-performing model were predictive of expert writer preferences.

### [267] [WebGen-Agent: Enhancing Interactive Website Generation with Multi-Level Feedback and Step-Level Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22644)
*Zimu Lu,Houxing Ren,Yunqiao Yang,Ke Wang,Zhuofan Zong,Junting Pan,Mingjie Zhan,Hongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WebGen-Agent is a novel website-generation agent that uses comprehensive visual feedback from screenshots and GUI-agent testing to iteratively generate and refine website codebases, outperforming previous state-of-the-art systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code agents for website generation rely only on simple code execution feedback, which fails to capture actual code quality and visual effectiveness. There's a need for better feedback mechanisms that evaluate visual aspects and user interactions.

Method: Uses visual language models to generate detailed text descriptions and suggestions from screenshots and GUI-agent testing, with quality scores. Integrates screenshot and GUI-agent scores with backtracking and select-best mechanisms. Introduces Step-GRPO training using visual scores as dense process supervision rewards.

Result: On WebGen-Bench dataset: increased Claude-3.5-Sonnet accuracy from 26.4% to 51.9% and appearance score from 3.0 to 3.9. Step-GRPO training increased Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct accuracy from 38.9% to 45.4% and appearance score from 3.4 to 3.7.

Conclusion: WebGen-Agent significantly improves website generation performance by leveraging comprehensive visual feedback and Step-GRPO training, demonstrating the effectiveness of visual evaluation in code generation tasks.

Abstract: Agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance on repository-level code-generation tasks. However, for
tasks such as website codebase generation, which depend heavily on visual
effects and user-interaction feedback, current code agents rely only on simple
code execution for feedback and verification. This approach fails to capture
the actual quality of the generated code. In this paper, we propose
WebGen-Agent, a novel website-generation agent that leverages comprehensive and
multi-level visual feedback to iteratively generate and refine the website
codebase. Detailed and expressive text descriptions and suggestions regarding
the screenshots and GUI-agent testing of the websites are generated by a visual
language model (VLM), together with scores that quantify their quality. The
screenshot and GUI-agent scores are further integrated with a backtracking and
select-best mechanism, enhancing the performance of the agent. Utilizing the
accurate visual scores inherent in the WebGen-Agent workflow, we further
introduce \textit{Step-GRPO with Screenshot and GUI-agent Feedback} to improve
the ability of LLMs to act as the reasoning engine of WebGen-Agent. By using
the screenshot and GUI-agent scores at each step as the reward in Step-GRPO, we
provide a dense and reliable process supervision signal, which effectively
improves the model's website-generation ability. On the WebGen-Bench dataset,
WebGen-Agent increases the accuracy of Claude-3.5-Sonnet from 26.4% to 51.9%
and its appearance score from 3.0 to 3.9, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art agent system. Additionally, our Step-GRPO training approach
increases the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct from 38.9% to 45.4% and
raises the appearance score from 3.4 to 3.7.

### [268] [VoiceAssistant-Eval: Benchmarking AI Assistants across Listening, Speaking, and Viewing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22651)
*Ke Wang,Houxing Ren,Zimu Lu,Mingjie Zhan,Hongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoiceAssistant-Eval is a comprehensive benchmark with 10,497 examples across 13 task categories to evaluate AI assistants' listening, speaking, and viewing capabilities, revealing that proprietary models don't always outperform open-source ones and that well-designed smaller models can rival larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating the full range of capabilities of voice-first AI assistants, particularly across listening, speaking, and viewing modalities.

Method: Created VoiceAssistant-Eval benchmark with 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories including natural sounds, music, spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn dialogue, role-play imitation for speaking; and heterogeneous images for viewing. Evaluated 21 open-source models and GPT-4o-Audio.

Result: Key findings: (1) proprietary models don't universally outperform open-source models; (2) most models excel at speaking but lag in audio understanding; (3) well-designed smaller models can rival larger ones (Step-Audio-2-mini outperformed LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual in listening). Challenges remain in multimodal input and role-play voice imitation.

Conclusion: VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies gaps in current AI assistants and establishes a rigorous framework for evaluating and guiding development of next-generation AI assistants, with code and data to be released publicly.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models and multimodal systems have
spurred interest in voice-first AI assistants, yet existing benchmarks are
inadequate for evaluating the full range of these systems' capabilities. We
introduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AI
assistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Eval
comprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasks
include natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn
dialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highly
heterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21
open-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the response
content and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three key
findings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-source
models; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding;
and (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, the
mid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listening
accuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal
(audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult for
current models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safety
alignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorous
framework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AI
assistants. Code and data will be released at

### [269] [Towards mitigating information leakage when evaluating safety monitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21344)
*Gerard Boxo,Aman Neelappa,Shivam Raval*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: White box monitors for detecting harmful behaviors in LLMs face evaluation challenges due to data leakage from elicitation methods. The paper proposes a framework and three strategies (content filtering, score filtering, and fine-tuned model organisms) to evaluate monitors' genuine detection capabilities, revealing significant performance drops when removing superficial artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge that white box monitors' performance is artificially inflated when training/evaluation data contains elicitation artifacts from prompts or fine-tuning, making it difficult to assess their true ability to detect harmful model behaviors.

Method: Proposes a systematic evaluation framework with three mitigation strategies: content filtering (removing deception-related text), score filtering (aggregating only task-relevant tokens), and prompt-distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained for deceptive behavior without explicit prompting).

Result: Experiments on deception benchmarks show: content filtering decreases AUROC by 30%, score filtering reduces AUROC by 15%, and fine-tuned model organisms reduce monitor performance by up to 40% even when re-trained, revealing significant performance inflation from elicitation and reasoning leakage.

Conclusion: Current white box monitor evaluations are significantly inflated by superficial artifacts from elicitation methods. The proposed framework provides more realistic assessment of monitors' genuine detection capabilities, with content filtering emerging as an effective mitigation strategy.

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages
for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including
lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However,
training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit
the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This
presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably
leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We
present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms
of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial
elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to
evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from
inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and
prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit
deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a
representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate
monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request
harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their
deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we
apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our
evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering
is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation
signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to
reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A
finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their
performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

### [270] [Correct Reasoning Paths Visit Shared Decision Pivots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21549)
*Dongkyu Cho,Amy B. Z. Zhang,Bilel Fehri,Sheng Wang,Rumi Chunara,Rui Song,Hengrui Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes decision pivots as verifiable checkpoints for reasoning paths and a self-training pipeline to align LLM reasoning without ground truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs lacks scalable verification methods, making it difficult to ensure reasoning quality at scale.

Method: Uses decision pivots as minimal verifiable checkpoints, samples diverse reasoning paths to mine shared pivots, compresses traces into pivot-focused reasoning, and post-trains models using self-generated outputs.

Result: Experiments on LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500 benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in improving reasoning alignment.

Conclusion: The approach successfully aligns LLM reasoning without requiring ground truth reasoning data or external metrics, using self-generated decision pivots.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exposes the intermediate thinking process of
large language models (LLMs), yet verifying those traces at scale remains
unsolved. In response, we introduce the idea of decision pivots-minimal,
verifiable checkpoints that any correct reasoning path must visit. We
hypothesize that correct reasoning, though stylistically diverse, converge on
the same pivot set, while incorrect ones violate at least one pivot. Leveraging
this property, we propose a self-training pipeline that (i) samples diverse
reasoning paths and mines shared decision pivots, (ii) compresses each trace
into pivot-focused short-path reasoning using an auxiliary verifier, and (iii)
post-trains the model using its self-generated outputs. The proposed method
aligns reasoning without ground truth reasoning data or external metrics.
Experiments on standard benchmarks such as LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500 show the
effectiveness of our method.

*Ahmed Jaber,Wangshu Zhu,Karthick Jayavelu,Justin Downes,Sameer Mohamed,Candace Agonafir,Linnia Hawkins,Tian Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A knowledge graph combined with AI agents lowers technical barriers in climate data science by enabling natural language interaction and automated workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate data science faces challenges from fragmented data sources, heterogeneous formats, and high technical expertise requirements that limit participation and reproducibility.

Method: Integration of a curated knowledge graph with AI agents powered by generative AI services, leveraging cloud-native workflows and existing API data portals.

Result: The system drastically lowers technical thresholds, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant datasets through natural language interaction.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates a pathway toward democratizing climate data access and establishing reproducible, extensible human-AI collaboration frameworks.

Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented
nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical
expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges
limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of
scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for
addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph
(KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG
provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while
AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language
interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these
components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate
data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant
datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate
that "a knowledge graph is all you need" to unlock scalable and agentic
workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further
supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can
evolve as a shared commons. Our results illustrate a pathway toward
democratizing access to climate data and establishing a reproducible,
extensible framework for human--AI collaboration in scientific research.

*Mohammad Parsa Afshar,Aryan Azimi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper compares classical machine learning models and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predicting consumer behavior using EEG data from the NeuMa dataset, finding that GNNs generally performed better in certain criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict consumer behavior using EEG data for applications in marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction, and to provide a comprehensive comparison between traditional machine learning models and newer GNN approaches.

Method: Extracted and cleaned EEG features from NeuMa dataset, created brain connectivity features for GNN models, implemented various GNN architectures and classical models including ensemble models and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Result: No significant overall performance difference between models, but GNN models generally performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were unsatisfactory.

Conclusion: Combining EEG signal analysis with machine learning provides deeper understanding of consumer behavior, and GNNs show promise as an alternative to traditional models in EEG-based neuromarketing applications.

Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in
marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The
electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by
providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this
research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior
by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa
dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models,
the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning
models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and
compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a
comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such
as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the
difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results
did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally
performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not
satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and
machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of
consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the
machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the
EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models
which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoEvolve is a multi-agent LLM framework that combines evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms, achieving significant improvements in spatial interpolation and uncertainty quantification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based algorithm discovery frameworks lack domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning required for complex geospatial problems, which are critical for addressing global challenges like sustainability and climate change.

Method: Two nested loops: inner loop uses code evolver to generate/mutate candidate solutions, outer agentic controller evaluates elites and queries GeoKnowRAG module (structured geospatial knowledge base) to inject theoretical priors from geography, enabling knowledge-guided evolution.

Result: Reduced spatial interpolation error (RMSE) by 13-21% and enhanced uncertainty estimation performance by 17% on kriging and geospatial conformal prediction tasks. Ablation studies confirmed domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable, high-quality evolution.

Conclusion: GeoEvolve provides a scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.

Abstract: Geospatial modeling provides critical solutions for pressing global
challenges such as sustainability and climate change. Existing large language
model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at
evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning
required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent
LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge
to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in
two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate
candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites
and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that
injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution
steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient
algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks:
spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification
(geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve
automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial
theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error
(RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\%.
Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable,
high-quality evolution. These results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a
scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening
new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.

TL;DR: MultiFIX is an interpretable multimodal AI framework that integrates clinical variables and CT imaging for survival analysis in head and neck cancer, achieving superior performance while maintaining transparency through feature interpretation and Cox regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate and interpretable survival analysis in oncology is growing due to increasing multimodal data and clinical requirements for transparent models that support validation and trust.

Method: The framework uses deep learning to extract survival-relevant features from CT imaging (interpreted via Grad-CAM) and clinical variables (modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic programming), with risk estimation performed using transparent Cox regression.

Result: On the RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieved C-index scores of 0.838 for prediction and 0.826 for stratification, outperforming clinical and academic baseline approaches while aligning with known prognostic markers.

Conclusion: MultiFIX demonstrates the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for precision oncology by providing both high performance and transparency in survival analysis.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable survival analysis remains a core challenge in
oncology. With growing multimodal data and the clinical need for transparent
models to support validation and trust, this challenge increases in complexity.
We propose an interpretable multimodal AI framework to automate survival
analysis by integrating clinical variables and computed tomography imaging. Our
MultiFIX-based framework uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features
that are further explained: imaging features are interpreted via Grad-CAM,
while clinical variables are modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic
programming. Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling
stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the
open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a
C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the
clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic
markers. These results highlight the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for
precision oncology with MultiFIX.

### [275] [Semantic F1 Scores: Fair Evaluation Under Fuzzy Class Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21633)
*Georgios Chochlakis,Jackson Trager,Vedant Jhaveri,Nikhil Ravichandran,Alexandros Potamianos,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Semantic F1 Scores are new evaluation metrics for subjective multi-label classification that measure semantic relatedness between predicted and actual labels using a similarity matrix, providing partial credit for semantically related predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional F1 metrics treat semantically related predictions as complete failures, which doesn't reflect the reality of domains with human disagreement or fuzzy category boundaries where similar predictions lead to similar outcomes.

Method: Uses a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like scores through a novel two-step precision-recall formulation that handles label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding labels or forcing matches.

Result: Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological validity through theoretical justification and empirical validation on synthetic and real data, and is robust to misspecification.

Conclusion: Semantic F1 provides fairer evaluations by recognizing category overlap and annotator disagreement, and is applicable across tasks and modalities since it only requires a domain-appropriate similarity matrix rather than a rigid ontology.

Abstract: We propose Semantic F1 Scores, novel evaluation metrics for subjective or
fuzzy multi-label classification that quantify semantic relatedness between
predicted and gold labels. Unlike the conventional F1 metrics that treat
semantically related predictions as complete failures, Semantic F1 incorporates
a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like
scores, from which the Semantic F1 scores are derived. Unlike existing
similarity-based metrics, our novel two-step precision-recall formulation
enables the comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding
labels or forcing matches between dissimilar labels. By granting partial credit
for semantically related but nonidentical labels, Semantic F1 better reflects
the realities of domains marked by human disagreement or fuzzy category
boundaries. In this way, it provides fairer evaluations: it recognizes that
categories overlap, that annotators disagree, and that downstream decisions
based on similar predictions lead to similar outcomes. Through theoretical
justification and extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real data, we
show that Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological
validity. Because it requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix,
which is robust to misspecification, and not a rigid ontology, it is applicable
across tasks and modalities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a scalable benchmark for evaluating physical safety understanding in Embodied AI systems, analyzes foundation models' safety perception capabilities, and introduces a post-training method to improve safety reasoning with interpretable thinking traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unique safety challenges when AI interacts with the physical world, where physical harm is direct and immediate, by assessing how well foundation models understand common-sense physical safety facts.

Method: Created a scalable physical safety benchmark using real-world injury narratives and operational constraints, converted into photorealistic images/videos via generative models. Analyzed foundation models' risk perception and safety reasoning, then developed a post-training paradigm to teach explicit safety constraint reasoning.

Result: Comprehensive analysis revealed insights into foundation models' deployment readiness for safety-critical applications. The post-training approach achieved state-of-the-art performance in constraint satisfaction evaluations while generating interpretable safety reasoning traces.

Conclusion: The work provides a systematic framework for benchmarking and improving physical safety understanding in Embodied AI, making safety reasoning transparent and interpretable through explicit constraint reasoning.

Abstract: When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent
-- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such
interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well
do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about
physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of
coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are
three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical
safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury
narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety
understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic
images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using
advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of
major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger
interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment
readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a
post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about
embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions.
The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning
interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in
constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt multilingual TTS models to low-resource languages using limited paired data and unpaired text with ASR-guided rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing TTS for low-resource languages is challenging due to scarce paired text-speech data, while ASR models are more accessible through multilingual pre-training.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Train multilingual TTS baseline with IPA tokens, 2) Fine-tune on limited paired data for target language prosody, 3) Apply GRPO optimization using unpaired text with rewards from ASR, speaker verification, and audio quality models.

Result: Produces intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages, substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Also improves TTS in high-resource languages, surpassing DPO with better intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

Conclusion: GRPO-based framework enables effective TTS adaptation for low-resource languages using ASR guidance and unpaired text, achieving superior performance compared to traditional fine-tuning and alignment methods.

Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource
languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In
contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are
often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts.
We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method
first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training
a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens.
Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to
capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to
optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a
multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio
quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces
intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages,
substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based
framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing
offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding
superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

*Ammar Ahmed,Azal Ahmad Khan,Ayaan Ahmad,Sheng Di,Zirui Liu,Ali Anwar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RoT (Retrieval-of-Thought) reuses prior reasoning steps as composable "thoughts" to guide new problems, reducing output tokens by up to 40% and inference latency by 82% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models produce long reasoning traces that inflate latency and cost, creating need for inference-time efficiency improvements.

Method: Organizes reasoning steps into a thought graph with sequential and semantic edges, retrieves query-relevant nodes, and applies reward-guided traversal to assemble problem-specific templates that guide generation.

Result: Reduces output tokens by up to 40%, inference latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy across reasoning benchmarks with multiple models.

Conclusion: RoT establishes a scalable paradigm for efficient large reasoning model reasoning via dynamic template construction through retrieval.

Abstract: Large reasoning models improve accuracy by producing long reasoning traces,
but this inflates latency and cost, motivating inference-time efficiency. We
propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable
``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought
graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible
recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies
reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides
generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and,
therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on
reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage,
latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial
efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference
latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy. RoT establishes a
scalable paradigm for efficient LRM reasoning via dynamic template construction
through retrieval.

*Jiyuan Pei,Yi Mei,Jialin Liu,Mengjie Zhang,Xin Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A lifelong learning framework for neural VRP solvers that addresses catastrophic forgetting by consolidating prior knowledge through behavior alignment and confidence-based weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural solvers struggle with new tasks due to poor zero-shot generalization or catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning, requiring a lifelong learning approach for sequential tasks with diverse distributions and scales.

Method: Proposed LLR-BC framework that consolidates prior knowledge by aligning behaviors of solvers trained on new tasks with buffered ones in a decision-seeking way, with greater weights assigned to low-confidence decisions.

Result: Extensive experiments on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems show LLR-BC effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting, maintains plasticity, and improves zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: LLR-BC successfully enables neural solvers to learn new tasks while preserving knowledge from previous tasks in lifelong learning settings.

Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to
solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on
one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and
scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either
zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between
the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on
the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge
acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning
paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse
distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to
effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their
performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called
Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed.
LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the
solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way.
To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater
consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments
on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems
demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers
in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue,
maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UltraHorizon is a novel benchmark for evaluating autonomous agents in long-horizon, partially observable tasks that require sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use, revealing significant performance gaps between LLM-agents and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks, creating a gap in evaluating agents for complex real-world challenges like software development, investment, and scientific discovery that require long-term capabilities.

Method: The benchmark uses exploration as a unifying task across three environments where agents must iteratively uncover hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool interaction, with trajectories averaging 35k-200k+ tokens and 60-400+ tool calls.

Result: LLM-agents consistently underperform in long-horizon settings while human participants achieve higher scores, showing a persistent capability gap. Simple scaling fails, with analysis revealing eight error types attributed to in-context locking and functional capability gaps.

Conclusion: UltraHorizon reveals critical limitations in current autonomous agents for long-horizon tasks and provides a systematic framework for evaluating and improving the foundational capabilities needed for complex real-world applications.

Abstract: Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse
domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks.
In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software
development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in
long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on
sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing
benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in
systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a
novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for
complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across
three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are
designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover
hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools
management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale
setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool
calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens
and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive
experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,
whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap
in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in
our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth
analysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and
attribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional
fundamental capability gaps.

*Junliang Liu,Jingyu Xiao,Wenxin Tang,Wenxuan Wang,Zhixian Wang,Minrui Zhang,Shuanghe Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WebRSSBench is a new benchmark that evaluates multimodal large language models on reasoning, robustness, and safety across 8 web-related tasks, revealing significant gaps in current models' capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus too much on visual perception or UI code generation, lacking comprehensive evaluation of reasoning, robustness, and safety needed for end-to-end web applications.

Method: Constructed from 729 websites with 3799 QA pairs, using standardized prompts, deterministic evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control with automatic checks and human verification.

Result: Evaluation of 12 MLLMs shows they struggle with compositional reasoning over realistic layouts, have limited robustness to UI perturbations, and are overly conservative in safety-critical scenarios.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have significant limitations in web understanding capabilities, particularly in reasoning, robustness, and safety, highlighting the need for improved benchmarks and model development.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly positioned as AI
collaborators for building complex web-related applications like GUI agents and
front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks largely emphasize
visual perception or UI code generation, showing insufficient evaluation on the
reasoning, robustness and safety capability required for end-to-end web
applications. To bridge the gap, we introduce a comprehensive web understanding
benchmark, named WebRSSBench, that jointly evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and
Safety across eight tasks, such as position relationship reasoning, color
robustness, and safety critical detection, etc. The benchmark is constructed
from 729 websites and contains 3799 question answer pairs that probe multi-step
inference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions.
To ensure reliable measurement, we adopt standardized prompts, deterministic
evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control combining automatic checks
with targeted human verification. We evaluate 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench. The
results reveal significant gaps, models still struggle with compositional and
cross-element reasoning over realistic layouts, show limited robustness when
facing perturbations in user interfaces and content such as layout
rearrangements or visual style shifts, and are rather conservative in
recognizing and avoiding safety critical or irreversible actions. Our code is
available at https://github.com/jinliang-byte/webssrbench.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: D-Artemis is a novel deliberative framework for GUI agents that uses a cognitive loop of Thinking, Alignment, and Reflection to automate user interactions without requiring complex training datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents face challenges including data bottlenecks in end-to-end training, high costs of delayed error detection, and risk of contradictory guidance, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The framework employs app-specific tip retrieval, proactive Pre-execution Alignment with Thought-Action Consistency Check and Action Correction Agent, and post-execution Status Reflection Agent to create a complete cognitive loop.

Result: D-Artemis achieves state-of-the-art performance with 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2 benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization without complex trajectory dataset training.

Conclusion: The framework significantly enhances MLLM capabilities for GUI tasks through its deliberative cognitive approach, with each component contributing substantially to overall performance as shown in ablation studies.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of
human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current
approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in
end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of
contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking,
Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative
framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip
retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a
proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC)
Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the
risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA)
completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience.
Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on
complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks,
achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2.
Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of
each component to the framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProRe is a proactive reward system for GUI agents that uses a general-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents to actively probe the environment for better reward accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward methods struggle with GUI agents due to lack of ground-truth trajectories or application databases, and static trajectory-based approaches have limited accuracy.

Method: Uses a reasoner to schedule targeted state probing tasks, which evaluator agents execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional observations for more accurate reward assignment.

Result: Improves reward accuracy and F1 score by up to 5.3% and 19.4% respectively on over 3K trajectories, and boosts success rate by up to 22.4% when integrated with state-of-the-art policy agents.

Conclusion: ProRe provides more accurate and verifiable rewards for GUI agents through proactive environment interaction, significantly improving both evaluation metrics and agent performance.

Abstract: Reward is critical to the evaluation and training of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing rule-based or model-based reward methods struggle to
generalize to GUI agents, where access to ground-truth trajectories or
application databases is often unavailable, and static trajectory-based
LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from limited accuracy. To address these
challenges, we propose ProRe, a proactive reward system that leverages a
general-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents (actors). The
reasoner schedules targeted state probing tasks, which the evaluator agents
then execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional
observations. This enables the reasoner to assign more accurate and verifiable
rewards to GUI agents. Empirical results on over 3K trajectories demonstrate
that ProRe improves reward accuracy and F1 score by up to 5.3% and 19.4%,
respectively. Furthermore, integrating ProRe with state-of-the-art policy
agents yields a success rate improvement of up to 22.4%.

*Jaehyun Nam,Jinsung Yoon,Jiefeng Chen,Jinwoo Shin,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DS-STAR is a novel data science agent that overcomes LLM limitations in handling heterogeneous data formats and generating optimal analysis plans through automated data exploration, iterative plan verification, and sequential refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data science tasks are complex and involve exploring multiple data sources, but LLMs struggle with heterogeneous data formats and generating sufficient analysis plans without ground-truth labels for open-ended tasks.

Method: DS-STAR uses three key components: (1) data file analysis module for exploring diverse data formats, (2) LLM-based judge for verifying plan sufficiency at each stage, and (3) sequential planning that starts simple and iteratively refines plans based on feedback.

Result: DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across DABStep, KramaBench, and DA-Code benchmarks, with particularly strong performance on hard tasks requiring processing multiple heterogeneous data files.

Conclusion: The iterative refinement approach with automated verification enables DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex data analyses involving diverse data sources, outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Data science, which transforms raw data into actionable insights, is critical
for data-driven decision-making. However, these tasks are often complex,
involving steps for exploring multiple data sources and synthesizing findings
to deliver insightful answers. While large language models (LLMs) show
significant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with
heterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as
verifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels
for such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR,
a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key
contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and
extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a
verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the
analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that
starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the
DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement
allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data
sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and
DA-Code. Moreover, DS-STAR particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks
that require processing multiple data files with heterogeneous formats.

TL;DR: A framework for modeling decisions with axioms (ethical constraints) reveals a Decision-Evaluation Paradox between using axioms to make decisions versus evaluating them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structural properties of decision axioms and identify potential conflicts in their application.

Method: Developed a framework for modeling decisions with axioms and defined a taxonomy based on structural properties.

Result: Discovered the Decision-Evaluation Paradox - a tension between using axioms for decision-making versus evaluation.

Conclusion: The paradox highlights the need for careful application of axioms in training models and decision processes.

Abstract: We introduce a framework for modeling decisions with axioms that are
statements about decisions, e.g., ethical constraints. Using our framework we
define a taxonomy of decision axioms based on their structural properties and
demonstrate a tension between the use of axioms to make decisions and the use
of axioms to evaluate decisions which we call the Decision-Evaluation Paradox.
We argue that the Decision-Evaluation Paradox arises with realistic axiom
structures, and the paradox illuminates why one must be exceptionally careful
when training models on decision data or applying axioms to make and evaluate
decisions.

TL;DR: DeepTravel is an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables autonomous travel planning agents to plan, execute tools, and refine actions through multi-step reasoning, outperforming frontier LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing travel planning agents rely on hand-crafted prompts and fixed workflows, limiting their flexibility and autonomy in generating travel itineraries.

Method: The framework uses a sandbox environment with cached travel data, hierarchical reward modeling with trajectory-level and turn-level verifiers, and reply-augmented reinforcement learning with experience replay.

Result: DeepTravel enables small LLMs (Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform frontier LLMs like OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks when deployed on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully creates autonomous travel planning agents capable of flexible, multi-step reasoning and verification, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Travel planning (TP) agent has recently worked as an emerging building block
to interact with external tools and resources for travel itinerary generation,
ensuring enjoyable user experience. Despite its benefits, existing studies rely
on hand craft prompt and fixed agent workflow, hindering more flexible and
autonomous TP agent. This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic
reinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent,
capable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool
responses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step
reasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by
caching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent
training without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g.,
inconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling
system, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal
feasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level
verifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses,
enabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply
augmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically
replay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We
deploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct
comprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel
enables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform existing
frontier LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks.

Method: Introduces Shachi framework that decomposes agent policies into three core cognitive components: Configuration (intrinsic traits), Memory (contextual persistence), and Tools (expanded capabilities), all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine.

Result: Validated on a 10-task benchmark and demonstrated through novel scientific inquiries. Showed external validity by modeling a real-world U.S. tariff shock, where agent behaviors aligned with observed market reactions only when properly configured with memory and tools.

Conclusion: Provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building and evaluating LLM agents to foster more cumulative and scientifically grounded research in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven
multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited
by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To
address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework
that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration
for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded
capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled
architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the
systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective
behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and
demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we
establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S.
tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions
only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory
and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building
and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and
scientifically grounded research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACE introduces a hierarchical Transformer architecture and function shift learning objective to better model computational graphs, outperforming existing methods on electronic circuit benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph representation learning methods like MPNNs and Transformers are architecturally mismatched for modeling computational graphs due to their permutation-invariant aggregation, which fails to capture the position-aware, hierarchical nature of computation.

Method: TRACE uses a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors step-by-step computation flow and introduces function shift learning - predicting only the discrepancy between true global function and simple local approximation rather than the complex function directly.

Result: TRACE substantially outperforms all prior architectures across comprehensive benchmarks on electronic circuits, demonstrating superior performance on complex computational graphs.

Conclusion: The architecturally-aligned backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for learning to compute on graphs, addressing fundamental challenges in computational graph modeling.

Abstract: Learning to compute, the ability to model the functional behavior of a
computational graph, is a fundamental challenge for graph representation
learning. Yet, the dominant paradigm is architecturally mismatched for this
task. This flawed assumption, central to mainstream message passing neural
networks (MPNNs) and their conventional Transformer-based counterparts,
prevents models from capturing the position-aware, hierarchical nature of
computation. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{TRACE}, a new paradigm built
on an architecturally sound backbone and a principled learning objective.
First, TRACE employs a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the step-by-step
flow of computation, providing a faithful architectural backbone that replaces
the flawed permutation-invariant aggregation. Second, we introduce
\textbf{function shift learning}, a novel objective that decouples the learning
problem. Instead of predicting the complex global function directly, our model
is trained to predict only the \textit{function shift}, the discrepancy between
the true global function and a simple local approximation that assumes input
independence. We validate this paradigm on electronic circuits, one of the most
complex and economically critical classes of computational graphs. Across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks, TRACE substantially outperforms all prior
architectures. These results demonstrate that our architecturally-aligned
backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for the
fundamental challenge of learning to compute on graphs.

*Ruiqi Chen,Yi Mei,Fangfang Zhang,Mengjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DyRo-MCTS integrates action robustness estimation into Monte Carlo Tree Search to improve dynamic job shop scheduling by making decisions that are adaptable to future job arrivals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing offline scheduling policies are imperfect and vulnerable to disturbances from unpredictable new job arrivals, necessitating robust online planning methods.

Method: Dynamic Robust MCTS (DyRo-MCTS) that incorporates action robustness estimation to guide scheduling decisions toward states that are both high-performing and easily adaptable to future disruptions.

Result: DyRo-MCTS significantly improves offline-learned policy performance with negligible additional planning time and consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across various scheduling scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust scheduling decisions that lead to sustainable long-term performance gains under dynamic disturbances.

Abstract: Dynamic job shop scheduling, a fundamental combinatorial optimisation problem
in various industrial sectors, poses substantial challenges for effective
scheduling due to frequent disruptions caused by the arrival of new jobs.
State-of-the-art methods employ machine learning to learn scheduling policies
offline, enabling rapid responses to dynamic events. However, these offline
policies are often imperfect, necessitating the use of planning techniques such
as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve performance at online decision
time. The unpredictability of new job arrivals complicates online planning, as
decisions based on incomplete problem information are vulnerable to
disturbances. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Robust MCTS
(DyRo-MCTS) approach, which integrates action robustness estimation into MCTS.
DyRo-MCTS guides the production environment toward states that not only yield
good scheduling outcomes but are also easily adaptable to future job arrivals.
Extensive experiments show that DyRo-MCTS significantly improves the
performance of offline-learned policies with negligible additional online
planning time. Moreover, DyRo-MCTS consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across
various scheduling scenarios. Further analysis reveals that its ability to make
robust scheduling decisions leads to long-term, sustainable performance gains

*Carlo Dindorf,Jonas Dully,Steven Simon,Dennis Perchthaler,Stephan Becker,Hannah Ehmann,Kjell Heitmann,Bernd Stetter,Christian Diers,Michael Fröhlich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study compares Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) and explainable machine learning for outlier detection in plantar pressure data, finding ML outperforms SPM in accuracy while both provide interpretable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plantar pressure datasets often contain outliers from technical errors or procedural inconsistencies, but existing methods like SPM have limitations in robust outlier detection and sensitivity to alignment.

Method: Compared SPM approach with explainable ML using CNN with SHAP explanations on dataset of 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers, evaluated via nested cross-validation and expert survey.

Result: ML model achieved higher accuracy than SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful variations and missed true outliers. Both SPM and SHAP explanations were perceived as clear and trustworthy by experts.

Conclusion: SPM and explainable ML have complementary potential for automated outlier detection in plantar pressure data, with explainability being crucial for translating complex model outputs into interpretable insights.

Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports
science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical
errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)
provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity
for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM
approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish
transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from
multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic
anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a
non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional
neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a
semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high
accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful
variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP
explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less
complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and
explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar
pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating
complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform
decision-making.

*Zhimin Wang,Shaokang He,Duo Wu,Jinghe Wang,Linjia Kang,Jing Yu,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoBel-World is a framework that enhances LLM-based multi-agent collaboration by modeling agents' mental states and enabling dynamic intent inference, reducing communication costs by 22-60% and improving task efficiency by 4-28%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM collaboration frameworks lack reasoning about collaborators' intents, leading to inconsistent plans and redundant communication in partial observable environments.

Method: Proposes CoBel-World framework with collaborative belief world that models physical environment and mental states, uses symbolic belief language for structured knowledge representation, and performs zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates through LLM reasoning.

Result: Significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task completion efficiency by 4-28% on TDW-MAT and C-WAH benchmarks compared to strongest baseline.

Conclusion: Explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate
planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents -- a
crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication
under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and
reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising
autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing
collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for
dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant
communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we
propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a
collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the
physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables
agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a
symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates
through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential
miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated
on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World
significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task
completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results
show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and
human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

*Renqi Chen,Zeyin Tao,Jianming Guo,Jingzhe Zhu,Yiheng Peng,Qingqing Sun,Tianyi Zhang,Shuai Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RISK is a framework for building GUI agents for e-commerce risk management that handles multi-step, stateful web interactions through a dataset, benchmark, and reinforcement fine-tuning method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scraping methods and existing GUI agents cannot handle the complex, multi-step, stateful interactions required for e-commerce risk management, which involves dynamic, interactive web content.

Method: RISK framework includes: (1) RISK-Data dataset with interaction trajectories, (2) RISK-Bench evaluation benchmark, and (3) RISK-R1 reinforcement fine-tuning framework with four reward aspects: output format, stepwise accuracy, process reweighting, and task level reweighting.

Result: RISK-R1 outperforms baselines with 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and 8.8% improvement in offline multi-step tasks, achieving 70.5% task success rate in online evaluation.

Conclusion: RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific solution for automating complex web interactions, advancing e-commerce risk management capabilities.

Abstract: E-commerce risk management requires aggregating diverse, deeply embedded web
data through multi-step, stateful interactions, which traditional scraping
methods and most existing Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents cannot handle.
These agents are typically limited to single-step tasks and lack the ability to
manage dynamic, interactive content critical for effective risk assessment. To
address this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build
and deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1)
RISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction
trajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a
meticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802
single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for
standardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning
framework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to
enhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step
Level: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early
training stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical
later steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to
focus on tasks of varying difficulty. Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms
existing baselines, achieving a 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and an
8.8% improvement in offline multi-step. Moreover, it attains a top task success
rate of 70.5% in online evaluation. RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific
solution for automating complex web interactions, advancing the state of the
art in e-commerce risk management.

### [294] [Bilinear relational structure fixes reversal curse and enables consistent model editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21993)
*Dong-Kyum Kim,Minsung Kim,Jea Kwon,Nakyeong Yang,Meeyoung Cha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The reversal curse in language models is not inherent but stems from knowledge encoding. Training on relational knowledge graphs induces bilinear representations that alleviate the curse and enable consistent model editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the view that the reversal curse is a fundamental limitation of language models and investigate how knowledge representation affects logical consistency.

Method: Train language models from scratch on synthetic relational knowledge graphs and analyze the emergence of bilinear relational structure in hidden representations.

Result: Models with bilinear structure can infer unseen reverse facts and propagate edits consistently to logically dependent facts, while models lacking this structure fail to generalize edits and introduce inconsistencies.

Conclusion: Bilinear internal representations enable logically consistent behavior in language models, and successful model editing depends critically on the underlying representational geometry of knowledge.

Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen
fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a
fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an
artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a
synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear
relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure
substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen
reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key
role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this
structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically
dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only
suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further
introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a
relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal
representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent
manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends
critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying
representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.

*Hanlin Zhu,Tianyu Guo,Song Mei,Stuart Russell,Nikhil Ghosh,Alberto Bietti,Jiantao Jiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GSM-Agent benchmark tests LLM agentic reasoning by requiring models to proactively collect missing information using tools to solve grade-school math problems, revealing limitations in revisiting previously visited nodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To disentangle agentic reasoning from other advanced capabilities in LLM agents, as current benchmarks often mix agentic reasoning with challenging math reasoning and expert-level knowledge.

Method: Created GSM-Agent benchmark where LLMs must solve grade-school math problems but are only given questions without premises, requiring proactive information collection using tools. Proposed agentic reasoning graph to analyze patterns and tool-augmented test-time scaling to improve performance.

Result: Even frontier models like GPT-5 only achieve 67% accuracy. Analysis revealed models often lack the ability to revisit previously visited nodes, a crucial pattern in static reasoning.

Conclusion: The benchmark and agentic reasoning framework provide tools for future studies to understand and improve agentic reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability
to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical
skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in
complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic
reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other
advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent,
where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems,
but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that
contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively
collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are
grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5
only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning
patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the
environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its
nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the
ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern
in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models.
Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to
improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models
to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid
future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic
reasoning.

*Xiaochong Lan,Yu Zheng,Shiteng Cao,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Model merging enables tunable reasoning capabilities in LLMs by combining general and specialized models, offering fine-grained control over accuracy-efficiency trade-offs with potential Pareto improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a growing need for LLMs with adjustable reasoning depth and computational cost for real-world applications, but current methods lack fine-grained control over this spectrum.

Method: Conducted large-scale empirical study evaluating various model merging techniques across reasoning benchmarks, systematically varying merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves.

Result: Model merging effectively calibrates reasoning accuracy vs. token efficiency trade-off, even with divergent parent models, and shows instances of Pareto Improvement (higher accuracy + lower token consumption).

Conclusion: Model merging provides practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning profiles to meet diverse application demands, offering the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable performance landscape.

Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning
capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for
methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning
depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising,
training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining
the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model.
While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of
models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely
unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range
of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We
systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves,
providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape.
Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable
method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token
efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces.
Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model
achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its
parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable
space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning
profiles to meet diverse application demands.

*Ziqi Wang,Boye Niu,Zhongli Li,Linghui Meng,Jing Liu,Zhi Zheng,Tong Xu,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A2R is an asymmetric two-stage reasoning framework that uses an explorer model to generate multiple solutions and a synthesizer model to refine them, achieving significant performance improvements and cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between a model's potential capabilities and its actual performance in single attempts, which is often only revealed across multiple solution paths.

Method: A two-stage framework with an explorer model generating potential solutions in parallel through repeated sampling, followed by a synthesizer model that integrates these references for refined reasoning.

Result: Qwen3-8B-distill model achieved 75% performance improvement over self-consistency baseline; A2R-Efficient variant with Qwen3-4B explorer and Qwen3-8B synthesizer surpassed monolithic Qwen3-32B model performance at 30% lower cost.

Conclusion: A2R is both a performance-boosting framework and an efficient practical solution for real-world applications, enabling orthogonal computation scaling to existing sequential methods.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in
complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the
inference stage with a "thinking longer" paradigm. Even as the foundational
reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a
model's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often
revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity
between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present
A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge
the gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this
framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel
through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these
references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage
process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential
methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a
plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's
capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the
Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its
self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the
explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling
paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that
combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration
surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly
30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a
performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for
real-world applications.

*Hadar Peer,Eyal Weiss,Ron Alterovitz,Oren Salzman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generalized multi-objective search formulation using aggregation functions of hidden objectives, enabling standard MOS algorithms to handle complex robotics problems by extending core operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world robotic systems need to balance multiple conflicting objectives, but complex interactions between objectives prevent direct use of state-of-the-art MOS algorithms.

Method: Develop a generalized problem formulation that optimizes solution objectives via aggregation functions of hidden search objectives, extending core operations of standard MOS algorithms to handle specific aggregation functions.

Result: Applied to diverse robotics planning problems (navigation, manipulation, medical systems, inspection, route planning), the extended MOS algorithms outperform vanilla versions by orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: The proposed formulation successfully enables standard MOS algorithms to handle complex multi-objective robotics problems through proper extension of core operations, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Multi-objective search (MOS) has become essential in robotics, as real-world
robotic systems need to simultaneously balance multiple, often conflicting
objectives. Recent works explore complex interactions between objectives,
leading to problem formulations that do not allow the usage of out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a generalized
problem formulation that optimizes solution objectives via aggregation
functions of hidden (search) objectives. We show that our formulation supports
the application of standard MOS algorithms, necessitating only to properly
extend several core operations to reflect the specific aggregation functions
employed. We demonstrate our approach in several diverse robotics planning
problems, spanning motion-planning for navigation, manipulation and planning fr
medical systems under obstacle uncertainty as well as inspection planning, and
route planning with different road types. We solve the problems using
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms after properly extending their core operations,
and provide empirical evidence that they outperform by orders of magnitude the
vanilla versions of the algorithms applied to the same problems but without
objective aggregation.

factors, raising the question of estimation accuracy. This study systematically
evaluates the reliability of static and dynamic energy estimation approaches
through comparisons with ground-truth measurements across hundreds of AI
experiments. Based on the proposed validation framework, investigative insights
into AI energy demand and estimation inaccuracies are provided. While generally
following the patterns of AI energy consumption, the established estimation
approaches are shown to consistently make errors of up to 40%. By providing
empirical evidence on energy estimation quality and errors, this study
establishes transparency and validates widely used tools for sustainable AI
development. It moreover formulates guidelines for improving the
state-of-the-art and offers code for extending the validation to other domains
and tools, thus making important contributions to resource-aware ML and AI

TL;DR: Log2Plan is a GUI automation system that combines two-level planning with task mining from user logs to achieve robust, adaptable automation with improved success rates and execution times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM/VLM-based GUI automation agents suffer from brittle generalization, high latency, and limited long-horizon coherence, making them fragile under UI changes or complex tasks.

Method: Combines structured two-level planning framework with task mining from user behavior logs. Constructs high-level plans by mapping commands to task dictionary, then grounds them into low-level action sequences using real-time GUI context.

Result: Evaluated on 200 real-world tasks, showing significant improvements in task success rate and execution time. Maintains over 60.0% success rate on long-horizon task sequences.

Conclusion: Log2Plan enables robust and adaptable GUI automation that handles complex, multi-step workflows effectively while supporting personalization and reuse through user behavior analysis.

Abstract: GUI task automation streamlines repetitive tasks, but existing LLM or
VLM-based planner-executor agents suffer from brittle generalization, high
latency, and limited long-horizon coherence. Their reliance on single-shot
reasoning or static plans makes them fragile under UI changes or complex tasks.
Log2Plan addresses these limitations by combining a structured two-level
planning framework with a task mining approach over user behavior logs,
enabling robust and adaptable GUI automation. Log2Plan constructs high-level
plans by mapping user commands to a structured task dictionary, enabling
consistent and generalizable automation. To support personalization and reuse,
it employs a task mining approach from user behavior logs that identifies
user-specific patterns. These high-level plans are then grounded into low-level
action sequences by interpreting real-time GUI context, ensuring robust
execution across varying interfaces. We evaluated Log2Plan on 200 real-world
tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rate and
execution time. Notably, it maintains over 60.0% success rate even on
long-horizon task sequences, highlighting its robustness in complex, multi-step
workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Machine learning evaluations should account for annotation uncertainty using probabilistic metrics that operate on distributions rather than aggregated labels, as this significantly impacts model rankings in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical dataset labels are uncertain due to annotator disagreement and varying confidence levels, but typical aggregation methods like majority voting obscure this variability.

Method: Propose probabilistic metrics that directly operate on label distributions, which can be applied regardless of annotation generating process (counting, confidence ratings, or probabilistic models).

Result: Accounting for confidence in binary labels significantly impacts model rankings in medical imaging benchmarks.

Conclusion: The community should release raw annotations and adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation to better reflect clinical data reality.

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and
confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as
majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical
imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels
significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning
evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using
probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can
be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether
modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic
response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form
expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model
score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and
to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better
reflect clinical data.

Conclusion: The work addresses key challenges in data quality, training efficiency, and domain knowledge extraction, paving the way for more reliable AI healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in
various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by
several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge
required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses.
Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture
domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the
computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses
significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose
InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs
designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We
combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed
a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality
multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and
multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the
integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised
fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical
tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B
outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B

*Aleksandar Terzić,Nicolas Menet,Michael Hersche,Thomas Hofmann,Abbas Rahimi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PD-SSM proposes a structured sparse parametrization of transition matrices in state-space models that enables efficient finite-state automata tracking with optimal state size while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to diagonal SSMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSMs use transition matrices that enable efficient computation but restrict expressivity for finite-state automata emulation, while unstructured matrices are too computationally expensive for practical use.

Method: Parametrizes transition matrix as product of column one-hot matrix (P) and complex-valued diagonal matrix (D), enabling linear scaling of parallel scan computational cost with state size.

Result: Outperforms modern SSM variants on FSA state tracking tasks, achieves comparable performance to neural controlled differential equations on time-series classification, and effectively tracks complex FSA states in hybrid Transformer-SSM architecture.

Conclusion: PD-SSM provides optimal FSA emulation capabilities with efficient computation, significantly improving on current structured SSM guarantees while maintaining practical computational costs.

Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which
enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity,
as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA).
While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity,
they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate
state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition
matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and
depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to
that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix
as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal
matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales
linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can
emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout
of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM
guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide
collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On
multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of
neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for
time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid
Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively
track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of
variable-length English sentences. The code is available at

### [305] [Large Language Models as Nondeterministic Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22297)
*Sander Beckers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a simpler method for generating counterfactuals in LLMs by treating them as nondeterministic causal models, contrasting with existing methods that require implementation modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ambiguities in existing counterfactual generation methods for LLMs and provide a more straightforward approach that aligns with LLMs' intended interpretation.

Method: Proposes representing LLMs as nondeterministic causal models rather than deterministic ones, enabling counterfactual generation without modifying the black-box LLM.

Result: Developed a simpler counterfactual generation method that is directly applicable to any black-box LLM and agnostic to implementation details.

Conclusion: Both methods have distinct advantages - the new method is simpler and universally applicable, while existing methods are useful for specific counterfactual types, establishing a foundation for application-specific approaches.

Abstract: Recent work by Chatzi et al. and Ravfogel et al. has developed, for the first
time, a method for generating counterfactuals of probabilistic Large Language
Models. Such counterfactuals tell us what would - or might - have been the
output of an LLM if some factual prompt ${\bf x}$ had been ${\bf x}^*$ instead.
The ability to generate such counterfactuals is an important necessary step
towards explaining, evaluating, and comparing, the behavior of LLMs. I argue,
however, that the existing method rests on an ambiguous interpretation of LLMs:
it does not interpret LLMs literally, for the method involves the assumption
that one can change the implementation of an LLM's sampling process without
changing the LLM itself, nor does it interpret LLMs as intended, for the method
involves explicitly representing a nondeterministic LLM as a deterministic
causal model. I here present a much simpler method for generating
counterfactuals that is based on an LLM's intended interpretation by
representing it as a nondeterministic causal model instead. The advantage of my
simpler method is that it is directly applicable to any black-box LLM without
modification, as it is agnostic to any implementation details. The advantage of
the existing method, on the other hand, is that it directly implements the
generation of a specific type of counterfactuals that is useful for certain
purposes, but not for others. I clarify how both methods relate by offering a
theoretical foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals in LLMs based on
their intended semantics, thereby laying the groundwork for novel
application-specific methods for generating counterfactuals.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRIME is a multi-agent reasoning framework that integrates fast System 1 thinking and deliberate System 2 thinking, enabling open-source LLMs to compete with state-of-the-art closed-source models on complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human dual-process cognition theory from Thinking, Fast and Slow, to enhance LLM reasoning efficiency and accuracy by mimicking human cognitive processes.

Method: Multi-agent framework with Quick Thinking Agent (System 1) for rapid answers, and structured System 2 pipeline with specialized agents for planning, hypothesis generation, retrieval, information integration, and decision-making when uncertainty is detected.

Result: Experimental results show PRIME enables LLaMA 3 models to perform competitively with GPT-4 and GPT-4o on multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: PRIME establishes a scalable solution for improving LLMs in complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning domains by faithfully mimicking human cognitive processes.

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking,
Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated
Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that
dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and
\textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick
Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is
detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of
specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation},
\textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and
\textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human
cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental
results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to
perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and
GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This
research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains
requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

TL;DR: SeekBench is a benchmark for evaluating LLM search agents' epistemic competence through step-level analysis of their response traces, focusing on evidence grounding, adaptive search reformulation, and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of LLM search agents focus only on final answer accuracy, overlooking how agents reason with and act on external evidence during the search process.

Method: Created SeekBench with 190 expert-annotated traces containing over 1,800 response steps from LLM search agents, enriched with evidence annotations for granular analysis of three key epistemic competencies.

Result: The benchmark enables evaluation of whether agents: (1) generate reasoning steps grounded in observed evidence, (2) adaptively reformulate searches to recover from low-quality results, and (3) have proper calibration to assess evidence sufficiency.

Conclusion: SeekBench provides the first comprehensive framework for assessing the epistemic competence of LLM search agents beyond final answer accuracy.

Abstract: Recent work has explored training Large Language Model (LLM) search agents
with reinforcement learning (RL) for open-domain question answering (QA).
However, most evaluations focus solely on final answer accuracy, overlooking
how these agents reason with and act on external evidence. We introduce
SeekBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the \textit{epistemic competence}
of LLM search agents through step-level analysis of their response traces.
SeekBench comprises 190 expert-annotated traces with over 1,800 response steps
generated by LLM search agents, each enriched with evidence annotations for
granular analysis of whether agents (1) generate reasoning steps grounded in
observed evidence, (2) adaptively reformulate searches to recover from
low-quality results, and (3) have proper calibration to correctly assess
whether the current evidence is sufficient for providing an answer.

TL;DR: EMMA is a VLA policy enhancement framework that uses DreamTransfer for generating multi-view consistent robot manipulation videos and AdaMix for hard-sample-aware training, achieving significant performance gains in zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting large-scale real-world robot manipulation data across varied conditions is time-consuming and expensive, creating a bottleneck for VLA model training and generalization.

Method: Proposes EMMA framework with DreamTransfer (diffusion Transformer for text-controlled video editing) and AdaMix (dynamic batch reweighting for hard samples), using hybrid training with real and generated data.

Result: DreamTransfer outperforms prior methods in multi-view consistency and geometric fidelity. VLAs trained with generated data achieve over 200% relative performance gain in zero-shot visual domains, with additional 13% improvement using AdaMix.

Conclusion: The approach effectively overcomes data collection bottlenecks and significantly boosts policy generalization to unseen object categories and novel visual domains.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models increasingly rely on diverse training
data to achieve robust generalization. However, collecting large-scale
real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and
environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To
overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation
(EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data
engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a
diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent,
geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables
text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground,
background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or
geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and
generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy
that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on
perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show
that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video
generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and
text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable
robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using
only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic
manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a
200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and
further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in
boosting policy generalization.

TL;DR: ASAL++ extends Automated Search for Artificial Life by using multimodal foundation models to propose new evolutionary targets based on simulation history, enabling open-ended-like search with increasingly complex targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance artificial life simulations by leveraging foundation models for automated search and open-ended evolution, building on previous work that used vision-language models to align simulations with natural language prompts.

Method: Introduces two strategies: Evolved Supervised Targets (EST) for evolving simulations to match single new prompts at each iteration, and Evolved Temporal Targets (ETT) for evolving simulations to match entire sequences of generated prompts. Uses Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets in the Lenia substrate.

Result: EST promotes greater visual novelty while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary sequences. The method demonstrates increasingly complex evolutionary trajectories.

Conclusion: ASAL++ points towards new directions for foundation model-driven artificial life discovery with open-ended characteristics, showing promise for automated evolution of complex systems.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have recently opened up new frontiers in the field of
artificial life (ALife) by providing powerful tools to automate search through
ALife simulations. Previous work aligns ALife simulations with natural language
target prompts using vision-language models (VLMs). We build on Automated
Search for Artificial Life (ASAL) by introducing ASAL++, a method for
open-ended-like search guided by multimodal FMs. We use a second FM to propose
new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history. This induces
an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets.
  We explore two strategies: (1) evolving a simulation to match a single new
prompt at each iteration (Evolved Supervised Targets: EST) and (2) evolving a
simulation to match the entire sequence of generated prompts (Evolved Temporal
Targets: ETT). We test our method empirically in the Lenia substrate using
Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets, and show that EST promotes greater
visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary
sequences.
  Our results suggest that ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven
ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoSketch is a neural-symbolic framework that transforms geometric reasoning into an interactive perception-reasoning-action loop, enabling dynamic diagram manipulation like auxiliary line construction and affine transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs process diagrams as static images, lacking the capacity for dynamic manipulation that is essential for human geometric reasoning, such as auxiliary line construction and affine transformations.

Method: Integrates three modules: Perception (abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms), Symbolic Reasoning (applies geometric theorems to decide next steps), and Sketch Action (executes operations like drawing lines or transformations). Uses two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning on curated trajectories followed by reinforcement learning with symbolic rewards.

Result: Significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and problem-solving success over static perception methods on the GeoSketch Benchmark of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or affine transformations.

Conclusion: GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems through hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic verification.

Abstract: Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text
and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing
approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for
dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving
auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a
neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive
perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module
that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning
module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and
(3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary
lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed
loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement
learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic
exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a
high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or
affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that
GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and
problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying
hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic
verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static
interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new
foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.

TL;DR: InfiAgent is a pyramid-like DAG-based multi-agent framework that automatically decomposes complex tasks into hierarchical multi-agent systems, featuring dual-audit mechanisms, agent routing, self-evolution, and parallelism for improved efficiency across infinite scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent development requires extensive manual design of workflows, prompts, and iterative tuning, which limits scalability and cost-effectiveness across industries. These hand-crafted limitations hinder widespread adoption.

Method: Proposes a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework with key innovations: agent-as-a-tool mechanism for automatic decomposition, dual-audit for quality assurance, agent routing for efficient matching, self-evolution for autonomous restructuring, and atomic task design for parallelism.

Result: InfiAgent achieves 9.9% higher performance than ADAS on multiple benchmarks. A case study shows InfiHelper (AI research assistant) generates scientific papers recognized by human reviewers at top-tier IEEE conferences.

Conclusion: The framework evolves into a versatile pyramid-like multi-agent system capable of solving diverse problems, demonstrating superior performance and practical applicability in real-world scenarios like scientific paper generation.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in organizing and executing complex tasks, and many such agents are now widely
used in various application scenarios. However, developing these agents
requires carefully designed workflows, carefully crafted prompts, and iterative
tuning, which requires LLM techniques and domain-specific expertise. These
hand-crafted limitations hinder the scalability and cost-effectiveness of LLM
agents across a wide range of industries. To address these challenges, we
propose \textbf{InfiAgent}, a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework that
can be applied to \textbf{infi}nite scenarios, which introduces several key
innovations: a generalized "agent-as-a-tool" mechanism that automatically
decomposes complex agents into hierarchical multi-agent systems; a dual-audit
mechanism that ensures the quality and stability of task completion; an agent
routing function that enables efficient task-agent matching; and an agent
self-evolution mechanism that autonomously restructures the agent DAG based on
new tasks, poor performance, or optimization opportunities. Furthermore,
InfiAgent's atomic task design supports agent parallelism, significantly
improving execution efficiency. This framework evolves into a versatile
pyramid-like multi-agent system capable of solving a wide range of problems.
Evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that InfiAgent achieves 9.9\%
higher performance compared to ADAS (similar auto-generated agent framework),
while a case study of the AI research assistant InfiHelper shows that it
generates scientific papers that have received recognition from human reviewers
at top-tier IEEE conferences.

TL;DR: Proposes empowerment (mutual information between agent actions and future states) as an open-ended evaluation metric for language model agents, introducing EELMA algorithm to estimate empowerment from multi-turn text interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are costly and require human-designed tasks, creating need for scalable evaluation frameworks for LM agents with real-world tool access.

Method: Developed EELMA algorithm to approximate effective empowerment from multi-turn text interactions, validated on language games and realistic web-browsing scenarios.

Result: Empowerment strongly correlates with average task performance, characterizes impact of environmental complexity and agentic factors (chain-of-thought, model scale, memory length), and high empowerment states/actions are pivotal for general capabilities.

Conclusion: Empowerment is an appealing general-purpose metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to
real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of
agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are
costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that
translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we
propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual
information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended
method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of
Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment
from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and
scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly
correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of
environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model
scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment
states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities.
Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose
metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework
designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments,
including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces REMA, a framework that analyzes reasoning failures in LLMs by defining a "Reasoning Manifold" - a low-dimensional geometric structure of correct reasoning representations, and quantifying deviations of erroneous representations from this manifold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs perform complex reasoning and identify failure mechanisms through measurable geometric analysis, addressing challenges in interpretability research.

Method: Define Reasoning Manifold concept, then use REMA framework to quantify geometric deviations of erroneous representations from correct ones using k-nearest neighbors distance, and track divergence points across model layers.

Result: Experiments show the low-dimensional nature of reasoning manifolds and high separability between correct and erroneous reasoning representations, validating REMA's effectiveness in analyzing reasoning failure origins.

Conclusion: This research connects abstract reasoning failures to measurable geometric deviations, providing new avenues for understanding and diagnosing internal computational processes of black-box models.

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and
their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To
provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of
the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by
the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned
generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the
effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a
given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the
origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of
internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct
reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation
of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors
distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,
thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence
points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this
deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline
of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where
the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on
diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the
low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability
between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also
validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of
reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to
measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for
in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of
black-box models.

*Haoyang Li,Xiao Jia,Zhanzhan Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show intrinsic heterogeneity in social tendencies, with two distinct archetypes: Adaptive Egoists (prioritize self-interest but can be influenced by social norms) and Altruistic Optimizers (inherently prioritize collective benefit).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research has focused on cooperation in small-scale games, overlooking how altruism emerges in large-scale agent societies. Understanding the social logics LLMs embody is critical for computational social science.

Method: Introduced a Schelling-variant urban migration model with over 200 LLM agents navigating conflicts between egoistic and altruistic goals. Used Grounded Theory-inspired method to systematically code agent reasoning.

Result: Found fundamental difference in social tendencies: Adaptive Egoists default to self-interest but increase altruism with social norms; Altruistic Optimizers consistently prioritize collective benefit even at personal cost.

Conclusion: Model selection for social simulation should consider intrinsic social action logic, not just reasoning capability. Adaptive Egoists better simulate complex human societies, while Altruistic Optimizers suit idealized pro-social scenarios.

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulation is a frontier
in computational social science. Understanding the social logics these agents
embody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily
focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how
altruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges
in large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a
Schelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma,
compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between
egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central
finding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We
identify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default to
prioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly
increase under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and
"Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,
consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to
themselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings
of these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to
systematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the
first evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic
tendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model
selection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of
choosing an intrinsic social action logic. While "Adaptive Egoists" may offer a
more suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, "Altruistic
Optimizers" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or
scenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.

*Chenyu Zhou,Tianyi Xu,Jianghao Lin,Dongdong Ge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepORLM is a self-evolving framework that uses generative process supervision to train LLMs on OR problems, addressing limitations of outcome rewards and discriminative supervision through a co-evolutionary loop between policy and reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM training methods for OR problems suffer from credit assignment issues (correct final answers reinforcing flawed reasoning) and myopic discriminative process supervision that fails to evaluate interdependent steps holistically.

Method: StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a policy model and generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve each other using dual-feedback: outcome-based verification from external solvers and holistic process evaluation from GenPRM, aligned via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization.

Result: The 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes new state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, outperforming larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. The co-evolved GenPRM also serves as a powerful universal process verifier, boosting inference scaling performance.

Conclusion: StepORLM demonstrates that generative process supervision and co-evolutionary training effectively address key limitations in LLM training for OR problems, achieving superior performance while producing universally applicable process verification capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving
Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a
powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally
face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit
assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning.
Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to
evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we
introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process
supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a
policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve
on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive,
outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic
process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the
policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously
refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new
state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly
larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover,
the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable
process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of
both our own model and other existing LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniMIC is a unified token-based multimodal interactive coding framework that enables efficient communication between edge devices and cloud AI agents using compact tokenized representations instead of raw pixels or text, achieving substantial bitrate savings while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing codecs are optimized for unimodal, one-way communication and suffer from degradation in bidirectional multimodal interactions between humans and AI agents, creating a need for more efficient multimodal communication frameworks.

Method: Proposes UniMIC framework using compact tokenized representations as communication medium, with lightweight Transformer-based entropy models (generic, masked, and text-conditioned) to minimize inter-token redundancy and enable low-bitrate transmission.

Result: Achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low bitrates (<0.05bpp) across text-to-image generation, text-guided inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering tasks, without compromising downstream task performance.

Conclusion: UniMIC establishes a practical and forward-looking paradigm for next-generation multimodal interactive communication, bridging edge devices and cloud AI agents efficiently.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and cloud-based AI
agents is transforming human-AI collaboration into bidirectional, multimodal
interaction. However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way
communication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional
compress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose
UniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that
bridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or
plain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the
communication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while
maintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression,
lightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific
designs-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token
redundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided
inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC
achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low
bitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These
results establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for
next-generation multimodal interactive communication.

TL;DR: Dynamic Experts Search (DES) is a test-time scaling strategy that leverages Mixture-of-Experts architecture to generate diverse reasoning paths by controlling expert activation counts, improving accuracy and stability without extra cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling approaches focus on output-level sampling but ignore model architecture. The authors observed that varying activated experts in MoE models creates complementary solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing an underexplored source of diversity.

Method: DES consists of two components: (1) Dynamic MoE - enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; (2) Expert Configuration Inheritance - preserves consistent expert counts within reasoning paths while varying them across runs to balance stability and diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments across MoE architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (math, code, knowledge) show DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing accuracy and stability without additional cost.

Conclusion: DES represents a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware test-time scaling, demonstrating how structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However,
existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking
the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we
observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary
solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of
diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search
(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable
dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic
MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate
diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert
Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a
reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and
diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE
architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and
knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing
accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as
a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how
structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

TL;DR: RL enhances LLM planning but lacks theoretical foundation. Analysis shows SFT creates spurious solutions while RL achieves correct planning through exploration, though PG suffers diversity collapse while Q-learning preserves diversity and enables off-policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical basis for RL's effectiveness in enhancing LLM planning capabilities, and to investigate the benefits and limitations of different RL methods.

Method: Theoretical analysis using a tractable graph-based abstraction, focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods, with application to the Blocksworld planning benchmark.

Result: SFT introduces co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, RL achieves correct planning through exploration, PG suffers from diversity collapse, Q-learning provides off-policy learning and diversity preservation, and careful reward design prevents reward hacking.

Conclusion: RL's exploration enables better generalization in planning, but method choice matters - Q-learning outperforms PG in preserving diversity, though reward design is crucial to prevent exploitation.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.
