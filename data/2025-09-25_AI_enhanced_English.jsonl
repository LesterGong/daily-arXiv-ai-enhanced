Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains\nvulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve\nmisleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing\nattacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily\ntarget vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD\nsystems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2)\nAdversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital\nlevel. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage\nAttack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on\noptimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate\nphysically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization\nacross different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the\nobserved vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA\nintroduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational\ndiscrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates\na multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its\nadaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world\nscenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various\nVLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing\nstate-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore,\nUCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic\nconditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes Universal Camouflage Attack (UCA), the first physical adversarial attack framework targeting Visual Language Models for Automated Driving (VLM-AD) systems, which generates physically realizable camouflage textures that generalize across commands and models.", "motivation": "Existing adversarial attacks have limitations: physical attacks target only vision modules and don't transfer well to VLM-AD systems, while VLM-AD attacks are mainly digital.
