While impressive progress has been made in\ngenerating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D\nassets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose\nStyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D\nassets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous\nworks, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,\nenabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or\nboth styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a\nnovel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a\ndynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for\nstyle-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling\nstable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate\nsemantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature\nselection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of\n3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,\nallowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With\nSD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or\nboth-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we\nfurther propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables\nexclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style\nintensity control.
