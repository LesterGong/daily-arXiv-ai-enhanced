### [1] [A Real-Time Diminished Reality Approach to Privacy in MR Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10466)
*Christian Fane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time diminished reality system for privacy control in MR meetings using semantic segmentation and inpainting to remove objects from secondary observer's view at 20+ fps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable privacy control in shared-space mixed reality meetings by allowing users to selectively remove personal or sensitive items from their environment to prevent visibility by other participants.

Method: Uses semantic segmentation and precise object selection with YOLOv11 for detection, followed by real-time inpainting using modified Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) model from secondary observer's viewpoint via mobile ZED 2i depth camera.

Result: System achieves frame rates exceeding 20 fps at 720p resolution, demonstrating real-time performance for practical privacy-preserving MR applications without requiring fixed secondary viewpoint or prior 3D scanning.

Conclusion: The presented system proves the feasibility of real-time diminished reality for privacy control in MR meetings, offering a portable and robust solution that maintains high-quality video inpainting while operating in real-time.

Abstract: Diminished reality (DR) refers to the digital removal of real-world objects
by compositing background content in their place. This thesis presents a
real-time, inpainting-based DR system designed to enable privacy control in
shared-space mixed reality (MR) meetings. The system allows a primary headset
user to selectively remove personal or sensitive items from their environment,
ensuring that those objects are no longer visible to other participants.
Removal is achieved through semantic segmentation and precise object selection,
followed by real-time inpainting from the viewpoint of a secondary observer,
implemented using a mobile ZED 2i depth camera. The solution is designed to be
portable and robust, requiring neither a fixed secondary viewpoint nor prior 3D
scanning of the environment. The system utilises YOLOv11 for object detection
and a modified Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) model for
high-quality video inpainting. At 720p resolution, the pipeline sustains frame
rates exceeding 20 fps, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time diminished
reality for practical privacy-preserving MR applications.

### [2] [SurgLaVi: Large-Scale Hierarchical Dataset for Surgical Vision-Language Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10555)
*Alejandra Perez,Chinedu Nwoye,Ramtin Raji Kermani,Omid Mohareri,Muhammad Abdullah Jamal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgLaVi is the largest surgical vision-language dataset with 240k clip-caption pairs from 200+ procedures, featuring automated hierarchical annotations and achieving state-of-the-art results in surgical recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in surgical vision-language pre-training is limited by small, low-quality datasets lacking procedural diversity and hierarchical structure. Existing datasets constrain the development of surgical foundation models.

Method: Created SurgLaVi dataset using automated pipeline that generates fine-grained transcriptions, segments videos into procedural units, and applies dual-modality filtering for quality. Introduced SurgCLIP - a CLIP-style video-text contrastive framework with dual encoders.

Result: SurgCLIP achieved consistent improvements across phase, step, action, and tool recognition tasks, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Released SurgLaVi-beta with 113k public clip-caption pairs (4x larger than existing datasets).

Conclusion: Large-scale, semantically rich, and hierarchically structured datasets directly translate into stronger and more generalizable representations, establishing SurgLaVi as a key resource for surgical foundation models.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) offers unique advantages for surgery by
aligning language with surgical videos, enabling workflow understanding and
transfer across tasks without relying on expert-labeled datasets. However,
progress in surgical VLP remains constrained by the limited scale, procedural
diversity, semantic quality, and hierarchical structure of existing datasets.
In this work, we present SurgLaVi, the largest and most diverse surgical
vision-language dataset to date, comprising nearly 240k clip-caption pairs from
more than 200 procedures, and comprising hierarchical levels at phase-, step-,
and task-level. At the core of SurgLaVi lies a fully automated pipeline that
systematically generates fine-grained transcriptions of surgical videos and
segments them into coherent procedural units. To ensure high-quality
annotations, it applies dual-modality filtering to remove irrelevant and noisy
samples. Within this framework, the resulting captions are enriched with
contextual detail, producing annotations that are both semantically rich and
easy to interpret. To ensure accessibility, we release SurgLaVi-\b{eta}, an
open-source derivative of 113k clip-caption pairs constructed entirely from
public data, which is over four times larger than existing surgical VLP
datasets. To demonstrate the value of SurgLaVi datasets, we introduce SurgCLIP,
a CLIP-style video-text contrastive framework with dual encoders, as a
representative base model. SurgCLIP achieves consistent improvements across
phase, step, action, and tool recognition, surpassing prior state-of-the-art
methods, often by large margins. These results validate that large-scale,
semantically rich, and hierarchically structured datasets directly translate
into stronger and more generalizable representations, establishing SurgLaVi as
a key resource for developing surgical foundation models.

### [3] [Building a General SimCLR Self-Supervised Foundation Model Across Neurological Diseases to Advance 3D Brain MRI Diagnoses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10620)
*Emily Kaczmarek,Justin Szeto,Brennan Nichyporuk,Tal Arbel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A high-resolution SimCLR-based self-supervised learning foundation model for 3D brain MRI that outperforms other methods across multiple neurological disease prediction tasks, even with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for 3D MRI brain scans are task-specific and lack generalization across different neurological conditions and populations. While SSL has shown success in 2D medical imaging, existing 3D brain MRI foundation models have limitations in resolution, scope, and accessibility.

Method: Developed a general, high-resolution SimCLR-based self-supervised learning foundation model pre-trained on 18,759 patients (44,958 scans) from 11 public datasets spanning diverse neurological diseases. Compared against Masked Autoencoders (MAE) and supervised baselines on four downstream prediction tasks.

Result: The fine-tuned SimCLR model outperformed all other models across all tasks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Notably achieved superior performance using only 20% of labeled training samples for Alzheimer's disease prediction.

Conclusion: The presented foundation model provides a broadly applicable and accessible solution for clinical brain MRI analysis, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across diverse neurological conditions with limited labeled data requirements.

Abstract: 3D structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain scans are commonly
acquired in clinical settings to monitor a wide range of neurological
conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and stroke. While deep
learning models have shown promising results analyzing 3D MRI across a number
of brain imaging tasks, most are highly tailored for specific tasks with
limited labeled data, and are not able to generalize across tasks and/or
populations. The development of self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled the
creation of large medical foundation models that leverage diverse, unlabeled
datasets ranging from healthy to diseased data, showing significant success in
2D medical imaging applications. However, even the very few foundation models
for 3D brain MRI that have been developed remain limited in resolution, scope,
or accessibility. In this work, we present a general, high-resolution
SimCLR-based SSL foundation model for 3D brain structural MRI, pre-trained on
18,759 patients (44,958 scans) from 11 publicly available datasets spanning
diverse neurological diseases. We compare our model to Masked Autoencoders
(MAE), as well as two supervised baselines, on four diverse downstream
prediction tasks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Our
fine-tuned SimCLR model outperforms all other models across all tasks. Notably,
our model still achieves superior performance when fine-tuned using only 20% of
labeled training samples for predicting Alzheimer's disease. We use publicly
available code and data, and release our trained model at
https://github.com/emilykaczmarek/3D-Neuro-SimCLR, contributing a broadly
applicable and accessible foundation model for clinical brain MRI analysis.

### [4] [USCTNet: A deep unfolding nuclear-norm optimization solver for physically consistent HSI reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10651)
*Xiaoyang Ma,Yiyang Chai,Xinran Qu,Hong Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USCTNet is a deep unfolding network that reconstructs hyperspectral images from RGB with explicit CSS and illumination estimation, using a novel low-rank SVT operator for improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-to-HSI reconstruction is ill-posed and becomes physically inconsistent when camera spectral sensitivity and scene illumination are misspecified, requiring a physics-grounded approach.

Method: Formulates RGB-to-HSI as physics-grounded inverse problem with nuclear norm regularization, estimates CSS and illumination explicitly, introduces data-adaptive low-rank subspace SVT to avoid full SVD costs, and develops USCTNet deep unfolding solver with parameter estimation and learnable proximal updates.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art RGB-based methods in reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed USCTNet framework effectively addresses the ill-posed nature of RGB-to-HSI reconstruction through physics-grounded formulation, explicit parameter estimation, and efficient low-rank optimization, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from a single RGB image is
ill-posed and can become physically inconsistent when the camera spectral
sensitivity (CSS) and scene illumination are misspecified. We formulate
RGB-to-HSI reconstruction as a physics-grounded inverse problem regularized by
a nuclear norm in a learnable transform domain, and we explicitly estimate CSS
and illumination to define the forward operator embedded in each iteration,
ensuring colorimetric consistency. To avoid the cost and instability of full
singular-value decompositions (SVDs) required by singular-value thresholding
(SVT), we introduce a data-adaptive low-rank subspace SVT operator. Building on
these components, we develop USCTNet, a deep unfolding solver tailored to HSI
that couples a parameter estimation module with learnable proximal updates.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art RGB-based methods in reconstruction accuracy. Code:

### [5] [A Comparison and Evaluation of Fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks to Large Language Models for Image Classification and Segmentation of Brain Tumors on MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10683)
*Felicia Liu,Jay J. Yoo,Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLMs underperform CNNs in medical imaging tasks like glioma classification and segmentation, showing limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement from fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can effectively handle image-based medical tasks like glioma classification and segmentation, as their utility in this domain remains unexplored despite strong performance in text-based healthcare applications.

Method: Evaluated a general-purpose vision-language LLM (LLaMA 3.2 Instruct) on BraTS 2020 dataset for glioma classification and segmentation, comparing performance before/after fine-tuning against custom 3D CNNs. Used three segmentation methods: center point, bounding box, and polygon extraction.

Result: CNNs achieved 80% accuracy in classification with balanced precision/recall, while general LLM reached 76% accuracy but suffered from 18% specificity. Fine-tuning improved specificity to 55% but overall performance declined. For segmentation, LLMs consistently clustered predictions near image center without distinguishing tumor characteristics, while CNNs accurately localized gliomas.

Conclusion: CNNs significantly outperform LLMs in medical imaging tasks. LLMs show limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement from fine-tuning, indicating they are not currently well-suited for image-based medical applications without more rigorous training strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in text-based
healthcare tasks. However, their utility in image-based applications remains
unexplored. We investigate the effectiveness of LLMs for medical imaging tasks,
specifically glioma classification and segmentation, and compare their
performance to that of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using
the BraTS 2020 dataset of multi-modal brain MRIs, we evaluated a
general-purpose vision-language LLM (LLaMA 3.2 Instruct) both before and after
fine-tuning, and benchmarked its performance against custom 3D CNNs. For glioma
classification (Low-Grade vs. High-Grade), the CNN achieved 80% accuracy and
balanced precision and recall. The general LLM reached 76% accuracy but
suffered from a specificity of only 18%, often misclassifying Low-Grade tumors.
Fine-tuning improved specificity to 55%, but overall performance declined
(e.g., accuracy dropped to 72%). For segmentation, three methods - center
point, bounding box, and polygon extraction, were implemented. CNNs accurately
localized gliomas, though small tumors were sometimes missed. In contrast, LLMs
consistently clustered predictions near the image center, with no distinction
of glioma size, location, or placement. Fine-tuning improved output formatting
but failed to meaningfully enhance spatial accuracy. The bounding polygon
method yielded random, unstructured outputs. Overall, CNNs outperformed LLMs in
both tasks. LLMs showed limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement
from fine-tuning, indicating that, in their current form, they are not
well-suited for image-based tasks. More rigorous fine-tuning or alternative
training strategies may be needed for LLMs to achieve better performance,
robustness, and utility in the medical space.

### [6] [Stable Part Diffusion 4D: Multi-View RGB and Kinematic Parts Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10687)
*Hao Zhang,Chun-Han Yao,Simon Donné,Narendra Ahuja,Varun Jampani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SP4D is a dual-branch diffusion framework that generates paired RGB videos and kinematic part segmentation maps from monocular inputs, enabling 3D skeletal structure extraction with minimal manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional part segmentation methods rely on appearance-based semantic cues, which don't align well with object articulation. There's a need for kinematic parts that are consistent across views and time for animation tasks.

Method: Uses a dual-branch diffusion model with spatial color encoding to map part masks to RGB-like images, sharing VAE latents between branches. Includes BiDiFuse module for cross-branch consistency and contrastive part consistency loss for spatial-temporal alignment.

Result: SP4D generalizes to diverse scenarios including real-world videos, novel objects, and rare poses. Generated 2D part maps can be lifted to 3D for skeletal structures and skinning weights with few manual adjustments.

Conclusion: The framework produces kinematic-aware outputs suitable for downstream animation and motion tasks, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across various input types.

Abstract: We present Stable Part Diffusion 4D (SP4D), a framework for generating paired
RGB and kinematic part videos from monocular inputs. Unlike conventional part
segmentation methods that rely on appearance-based semantic cues, SP4D learns
to produce kinematic parts - structural components aligned with object
articulation and consistent across views and time. SP4D adopts a dual-branch
diffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and corresponding part
segmentation maps. To simplify the architecture and flexibly enable different
part counts, we introduce a spatial color encoding scheme that maps part masks
to continuous RGB-like images. This encoding allows the segmentation branch to
share the latent VAE from the RGB branch, while enabling part segmentation to
be recovered via straightforward post-processing. A Bidirectional Diffusion
Fusion (BiDiFuse) module enhances cross-branch consistency, supported by a
contrastive part consistency loss to promote spatial and temporal alignment of
part predictions. We demonstrate that the generated 2D part maps can be lifted
to 3D to derive skeletal structures and harmonic skinning weights with few
manual adjustments. To train and evaluate SP4D, we construct KinematicParts20K,
a curated dataset of over 20K rigged objects selected and processed from
Objaverse XL (Deitke et al., 2023), each paired with multi-view RGB and part
video sequences. Experiments show that SP4D generalizes strongly to diverse
scenarios, including real-world videos, novel generated objects, and rare
articulated poses, producing kinematic-aware outputs suitable for downstream
animation and motion-related tasks.

### [7] [SegSLR: Promptable Video Segmentation for Isolated Sign Language Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10710)
*Sven Schreiber,Noha Sarhan,Simone Frintrop,Christian Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegSLR is an ISLR system that combines RGB and pose data using promptable zero-shot video segmentation to better preserve hand shape and orientation details, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on ChaLearn249 IsoGD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ISLR approaches lose crucial details like hand shape and orientation when combining RGB and pose modalities due to imprecise representations like bounding boxes.

Method: Uses promptable zero-shot video segmentation to segment hands and body parts from pose information, then focuses RGB processing on these relevant segments to effectively combine both modalities.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the complex ChaLearn249 IsoGD dataset, with ablation studies showing strong benefits from focusing on signer's body and hands.

Conclusion: SegSLR effectively combines RGB and pose information through segmentation, maintaining crucial shape details and achieving superior ISLR performance.

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) approaches primarily rely on RGB
data or signer pose information. However, combining these modalities often
results in the loss of crucial details, such as hand shape and orientation, due
to imprecise representations like bounding boxes. Therefore, we propose the
ISLR system SegSLR, which combines RGB and pose information through promptable
zero-shot video segmentation. Given the rough localization of the hands and the
signer's body from pose information, we segment the respective parts through
the video to maintain all relevant shape information. Subsequently, the
segmentations focus the processing of the RGB data on the most relevant body
parts for ISLR. This effectively combines RGB and pose information. Our
evaluation on the complex ChaLearn249 IsoGD dataset shows that SegSLR
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, ablation studies indicate
that SegSLR strongly benefits from focusing on the signer's body and hands,
justifying our design choices.

### [8] [SCOPE: Speech-guided COllaborative PErception Framework for Surgical Scene Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10748)
*Jecia Z. Y. Mao,Francis X Creighton,Russell H Taylor,Manish Sahu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE framework integrates speech guidance with vision foundation models for real-time surgical scene segmentation and tracking without manual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical segmentation models require domain-specific labeled data and manual inputs, limiting adaptability in dynamic operating environments.

Method: Speech-guided collaborative perception framework combining LLM reasoning with open-set VFMs, using clinician speech feedback to guide segmentation and instrument-based labeling.

Result: Evaluated on Cataract1k and in-house skull-base datasets, demonstrating real-time segmentation and tracking capabilities in mock ex-vivo experiments.

Conclusion: The human-AI collaboration paradigm enables adaptable, hands-free surgical tools for dynamic operating rooms.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and tracking of relevant elements of the surgical scene
is crucial to enable context-aware intraoperative assistance and decision
making. Current solutions remain tethered to domain-specific, supervised models
that rely on labeled data and required domain-specific data to adapt to new
surgical scenarios and beyond predefined label categories. Recent advances in
prompt-driven vision foundation models (VFM) have enabled open-set, zero-shot
segmentation across heterogeneous medical images. However, dependence of these
models on manual visual or textual cues restricts their deployment in
introperative surgical settings. We introduce a speech-guided collaborative
perception (SCOPE) framework that integrates reasoning capabilities of large
language model (LLM) with perception capabilities of open-set VFMs to support
on-the-fly segmentation, labeling and tracking of surgical instruments and
anatomy in intraoperative video streams. A key component of this framework is a
collaborative perception agent, which generates top candidates of VFM-generated
segmentation and incorporates intuitive speech feedback from clinicians to
guide the segmentation of surgical instruments in a natural human-machine
collaboration paradigm. Afterwards, instruments themselves serve as interactive
pointers to label additional elements of the surgical scene. We evaluated our
proposed framework on a subset of publicly available Cataract1k dataset and an
in-house ex-vivo skull-base dataset to demonstrate its potential to generate
on-the-fly segmentation and tracking of surgical scene. Furthermore, we
demonstrate its dynamic capabilities through a live mock ex-vivo experiment.
This human-AI collaboration paradigm showcase the potential of developing
adaptable, hands-free, surgeon-centric tools for dynamic operating-room
environments.

### [9] [Every Camera Effect, Every Time, All at Once: 4D Gaussian Ray Tracing for Physics-based Camera Effect Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10759)
*Yi-Ruei Liu,You-Zhe Xie,Yu-Hsiang Hsu,I-Sheng Fang,Yu-Lun Liu,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4D-GRT is a novel pipeline combining 4D Gaussian Splatting with ray tracing to generate videos with realistic camera effects like fisheye distortion and rolling shutter, achieving fast rendering and high quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computer vision systems fail with real-world camera effects due to lack of training data. Existing data generation methods are costly, have sim-to-real gaps, or fail to accurately model camera effects.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Reconstructs dynamic scenes from multi-view videos using 4D Gaussian Splatting, 2) Applies physically-based ray tracing to generate videos with controllable, physically accurate camera effects.

Result: Achieves fastest rendering speed while performing better or comparable rendering quality compared to existing baselines. Created benchmark with eight synthetic dynamic scenes across four camera effects.

Conclusion: 4D-GRT effectively addresses the bottleneck of generating realistic camera effect data for training computer vision systems, providing both speed and accuracy advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: Common computer vision systems typically assume ideal pinhole cameras but
fail when facing real-world camera effects such as fisheye distortion and
rolling shutter, mainly due to the lack of learning from training data with
camera effects. Existing data generation approaches suffer from either high
costs, sim-to-real gaps or fail to accurately model camera effects. To address
this bottleneck, we propose 4D Gaussian Ray Tracing (4D-GRT), a novel two-stage
pipeline that combines 4D Gaussian Splatting with physically-based ray tracing
for camera effect simulation. Given multi-view videos, 4D-GRT first
reconstructs dynamic scenes, then applies ray tracing to generate videos with
controllable, physically accurate camera effects. 4D-GRT achieves the fastest
rendering speed while performing better or comparable rendering quality
compared to existing baselines. Additionally, we construct eight synthetic
dynamic scenes in indoor environments across four camera effects as a benchmark
to evaluate generated videos with camera effects.

*Marcelo Sandoval-Castaneda,Bryan Russell,Josef Sivic,Gregory Shakhnarovich,Fabian Caba Heilbron*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-agent system for automated video editing using Editor and Critic agents with natural language instructions and feedback, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate core video editing tasks for applications in filmmaking, advertising, and social media content creation, moving beyond retrieval-focused approaches.

Method: Two-agent approach: Editor agent uses video editing tools with natural language instructions, Critic agent provides feedback. Learning-based communication between specialized agents. LLM-as-judge evaluation metric.

Result: System vastly outperforms existing approaches in coverage, time constraint satisfaction, and human preference based on user study evaluations.

Conclusion: Multi-agent framework with specialized Editor and Critic agents effectively automates language-driven video editing, demonstrating superior performance over previous methods.

Abstract: Automated tools for video editing and assembly have applications ranging from
filmmaking and advertisement to content creation for social media. Previous
video editing work has mainly focused on either retrieval or user interfaces,
leaving actual editing to the user. In contrast, we propose to automate the
core task of video editing, formulating it as sequential decision making
process. Ours is a multi-agent approach. We design an Editor agent and a Critic
agent. The Editor takes as input a collection of video clips together with
natural language instructions and uses tools commonly found in video editing
software to produce an edited sequence. On the other hand, the Critic gives
natural language feedback to the editor based on the produced sequence or
renders it if it is satisfactory. We introduce a learning-based approach for
enabling effective communication across specialized agents to address the
language-driven video editing task. Finally, we explore an LLM-as-a-judge
metric for evaluating the quality of video editing system and compare it with
general human preference. We evaluate our system's output video sequences
qualitatively and quantitatively through a user study and find that our system
vastly outperforms existing approaches in terms of coverage, time constraint
satisfaction, and human preference.

*Sajad Amiri,Shahram Taeb,Sara Gharibi,Setareh Dehghanfard,Somayeh Sadat Mehrnia,Mehrdad Oveisi,Ilker Hacihaliloglu,Arman Rahmim,Mohammad R. Salmanpour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A stability-aware ML framework predicts glioma MRI contrast enhancement from non-contrast scans, achieving 0.93 average accuracy across multicenter datasets, reducing need for gadolinium contrast agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) pose safety, cost, and accessibility concerns in glioma imaging. Predicting enhancement from non-contrast MRI offers a safer alternative for assessing tumor aggressiveness and treatment planning.

Method: Analyzed 1,446 glioma cases from 4 TCIA datasets. Extracted 108 radiomic features from non-contrast T1WI, combined with 48 dimensionality reduction methods and 25 classifiers (1,200 total pipelines). Used rotational validation trained on 3 datasets and tested on the fourth.

Result: Cross-validation accuracy: 0.91-0.96; External testing: 0.87-0.98 (average 0.93). F1, precision, recall stable (0.87-0.96), ROC-AUC varied (0.50-0.82). MI+ETr pipeline consistently ranked highest for accuracy and stability.

Conclusion: Stability-aware model selection enables reliable prediction of contrast enhancement from non-contrast MRI, reducing GBCA reliance and improving multicenter generalizability. Provides scalable template for reproducible ML in neuro-oncology.

Abstract: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are central to glioma imaging but
raise safety, cost, and accessibility concerns. Predicting contrast enhancement
from non-contrast MRI using machine learning (ML) offers a safer alternative,
as enhancement reflects tumor aggressiveness and informs treatment planning.
Yet scanner and cohort variability hinder robust model selection. We propose a
stability-aware framework to identify reproducible ML pipelines for multicenter
prediction of glioma MRI contrast enhancement. We analyzed 1,446 glioma cases
from four TCIA datasets (UCSF-PDGM, UPENN-GB, BRATS-Africa, BRATS-TCGA-LGG).
Non-contrast T1WI served as input, with enhancement derived from paired
post-contrast T1WI. Using PyRadiomics under IBSI standards, 108 features were
extracted and combined with 48 dimensionality reduction methods and 25
classifiers, yielding 1,200 pipelines. Rotational validation was trained on
three datasets and tested on the fourth. Cross-validation prediction accuracies
ranged from 0.91 to 0.96, with external testing achieving 0.87 (UCSF-PDGM),
0.98 (UPENN-GB), and 0.95 (BRATS-Africa), with an average of 0.93. F1,
precision, and recall were stable (0.87 to 0.96), while ROC-AUC varied more
widely (0.50 to 0.82), reflecting cohort heterogeneity. The MI linked with ETr
pipeline consistently ranked highest, balancing accuracy and stability. This
framework demonstrates that stability-aware model selection enables reliable
prediction of contrast enhancement from non-contrast glioma MRI, reducing
reliance on GBCAs and improving generalizability across centers. It provides a
scalable template for reproducible ML in neuro-oncology and beyond.

### [12] [Group Evidence Matters: Tiling-based Semantic Gating for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10779)
*Yilun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A detector-agnostic post-processing framework that improves recall for dense small objects in UAV imagery by converting overlap-induced redundancy into group evidence through spatial and semantic clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense small objects in UAV imagery are often missed due to long-range viewpoints, occlusion, and clutter, requiring improved detection recall.

Method: Uses overlapping tiling to recover low-confidence candidates, then validates group evidence through Spatial Gate (DBSCAN on box centroids) and Semantic Gate (DBSCAN on ResNet-18 embeddings), followed by controlled confidence reweighting and class-aware NMS fusion.

Result: On VisDrone dataset: recall increased from 0.685 to 0.778 (+0.093), precision adjusted from 0.801 to 0.595, yielding F1=0.669. Post-processing latency averages 0.095s per image.

Conclusion: The framework provides recall-first, precision-trade-off behavior beneficial for recall-sensitive applications like far-field counting and monitoring, requires no retraining, and integrates with modern detectors.

Abstract: Dense small objects in UAV imagery are often missed due to long-range
viewpoints, occlusion, and clutter[cite: 5]. This paper presents a
detector-agnostic post-processing framework that converts overlap-induced
redundancy into group evidence[cite: 6]. Overlapping tiling first recovers
low-confidence candidates[cite: 7]. A Spatial Gate (DBSCAN on box centroids)
and a Semantic Gate (DBSCAN on ResNet-18 embeddings) then validates group
evidence[cite: 7]. Validated groups receive controlled confidence reweighting
before class-aware NMS fusion[cite: 8]. Experiments on VisDrone show a recall
increase from 0.685 to 0.778 (+0.093) and a precision adjustment from 0.801 to
0.595, yielding F1=0.669[cite: 9]. Post-processing latency averages 0.095 s per
image[cite: 10]. These results indicate recall-first, precision-trade-off
behavior that benefits recall-sensitive applications such as far-field counting
and monitoring[cite: 10]. Ablation confirms that tiling exposes missed objects,
spatial clustering stabilizes geometry, semantic clustering enforces appearance
coherence, and reweighting provides calibrated integration with the
baseline[cite: 11]. The framework requires no retraining and integrates with
modern detectors[cite: 12]. Future work will reduce semantic gating cost and
extend the approach with temporal cues[cite: 13].

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InternScenes is a large-scale simulatable indoor scene dataset with 40K diverse scenes, 1.96M 3D objects, and realistic layouts including small items, addressing limitations of existing datasets for Embodied AI research.


<details>

Motivation: Existing 3D scene datasets suffer from limitations in scale, diversity, sanitized layouts lacking small items, and object collisions, hindering progress in Embodied AI.

Method: Created by integrating three scene sources (real-world scans, procedural generation, designer-created scenes) with comprehensive processing including real-to-sim replicas, interactive object incorporation, and collision resolution via physical simulations.

Result: Dataset contains 40K scenes, 1.96M objects, 15 scene types, 288 object classes, with realistic complex layouts averaging 41.5 objects per region. Demonstrated value through scene layout generation and point-goal navigation benchmarks.

Conclusion: InternScenes enables scaling model training for complex scene tasks, poses new challenges with realistic layouts, and will be open-sourced to benefit the research community.

Abstract: The advancement of Embodied AI heavily relies on large-scale, simulatable 3D
scene datasets characterized by scene diversity and realistic layouts. However,
existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity,
sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address
these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale
simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes
by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally
generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and
covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve
massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts
with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing
pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world
scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these
scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate
the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout
generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the
complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for
scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and
navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the
data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.

*Robert M. Corless,Deepak Singh Kalhan,Stephen M. Watt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of basis choice trade-offs (Legendre, Chebyshev, Sobolev variants) for parameterized polynomial representation of mathematical handwriting, focusing on condition numbers and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize the trade-off between basis selection and polynomial degree for accurate mathematical handwriting modeling while minimizing computational costs.

Method: Analyzes condition numbers for polynomial evaluation in Legendre, Chebyshev, and their Sobolev variants, and bounds how different inner products provide norms for symbol variations.

Result: Provides insights into computational efficiency and accuracy trade-offs between different polynomial bases for handwriting representation.

Conclusion: The choice of polynomial basis significantly impacts computational cost and modeling accuracy for mathematical handwriting representation, with condition numbers and inner product norms being key factors.

Abstract: Previous work has made use of a parameterized plane curve polynomial
representation for mathematical handwriting, with the polynomials represented
in a Legendre or Legendre-Sobolev graded basis. This provides a compact
geometric representation for the digital ink. Preliminary results have also
been shown for Chebyshev and Chebyshev-Sobolev bases. This article explores the
trade-offs between basis choice and polynomial degree to achieve accurate
modeling with a low computational cost. To do this, we consider the condition
number for polynomial evaluation in these bases and bound how the various inner
products give norms for the variations between symbols.

### [15] [Multi-Task Diffusion Approach For Prediction of Glioma Tumor Progression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10824)
*Aghiles Kebaili,Romain Modzelewski,Jérôme Lapuyade-Lahorgue,Maxime Fontanilles,Sébastien Thureau,Su Ruan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multitask diffusion framework for time-agnostic pixel-wise prediction of glioma progression from sparse longitudinal MRI data, incorporating deformation modeling, targeted augmentation, and radiotherapy-weighted loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glioma progression prediction is challenging due to sparse, irregular longitudinal MRI data with incomplete follow-up sequences, creating data imbalances that hinder reliable modeling in clinical practice.

Method: Multitask diffusion framework that simultaneously generates future FLAIR sequences at any time point and estimates spatial probabilistic tumor evolution maps using signed distance fields. Includes pretrained deformation module for temporal dynamics, targeted augmentation pipeline for data scarcity, and radiotherapy-weighted focal loss leveraging radiation dose maps.

Result: The framework produces flexible time-dependent probability maps from just two earlier follow-up scans, enabling tumor progression risk assessment at any future milestone. Achieved promising results when trained on public dataset and evaluated on private internal dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses clinical limitations of sparse longitudinal MRI data by providing time-agnostic progression predictions with uncertainty quantification, improving stability and accuracy for glioma evolution modeling in real-world clinical scenarios.

Abstract: Glioma, an aggressive brain malignancy characterized by rapid progression and
its poor prognosis, poses significant challenges for accurate evolution
prediction. These challenges are exacerbated by sparse, irregularly acquired
longitudinal MRI data in clinical practice, where incomplete follow-up
sequences create data imbalances and make reliable modeling difficult. In this
paper, we present a multitask diffusion framework for time-agnostic, pixel-wise
prediction of glioma progression. The model simultaneously generates future
FLAIR sequences at any chosen time point and estimates spatial probabilistic
tumor evolution maps derived using signed distance fields (SDFs), allowing
uncertainty quantification. To capture temporal dynamics of tumor evolution
across arbitrary intervals, we integrate a pretrained deformation module that
models inter-scan changes using deformation fields. Regarding the common
clinical limitation of data scarcity, we implement a targeted augmentation
pipeline that synthesizes complete sequences of three follow-up scans and
imputes missing MRI modalities from available patient studies, improving the
stability and accuracy of predictive models. Based on merely two follow-up
scans at earlier timepoints, our framework produces flexible time-depending
probability maps, enabling clinicians to interrogate tumor progression risks at
any future temporal milestone. We further introduce a radiotherapy-weighted
focal loss term that leverages radiation dose maps, as these highlight regions
of greater clinical importance during model training. The proposed method was
trained on a public dataset and evaluated on an internal private dataset,
achieving promising results in both cases

*Simone Mosco,Daniel Fusaro,Wanmeng Li,Emanuele Menegatti,Alberto Pretto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A LiDAR point cloud segmentation method that uses point-plane projections to extract 2D features from 3D data, with geometry-aware data augmentation for improved performance in limited-data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR segmentation methods suffer from high computational complexity, require large training datasets, and have limited generalization in data-scarce scenarios. The paper aims to improve point-based methods by learning from 2D representations while using only LiDAR data.

Method: Uses point-plane projections to create multiple informative 2D representations from point clouds, extracts complementary features from these 2D views, and introduces geometry-aware data augmentation that aligns with LiDAR sensor properties to address class imbalance.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in limited-data scenarios and competitive results on standard datasets SemanticKITTI and PandaSet.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively leverages 2D representations through point-plane projections to enhance LiDAR point cloud segmentation, particularly in data-scarce environments, while maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation is essential for interpreting 3D
environments in applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. Recent
methods achieve strong performance by exploiting different point cloud
representations or incorporating data from other sensors, such as cameras or
external datasets. However, these approaches often suffer from high
computational complexity and require large amounts of training data, limiting
their generalization in data-scarce scenarios. In this paper, we improve the
performance of point-based methods by effectively learning features from 2D
representations through point-plane projections, enabling the extraction of
complementary information while relying solely on LiDAR data. Additionally, we
introduce a geometry-aware technique for data augmentation that aligns with
LiDAR sensor properties and mitigates class imbalance. We implemented and
evaluated our method that applies point-plane projections onto multiple
informative 2D representations of the point cloud. Experiments demonstrate that
this approach leads to significant improvements in limited-data scenarios,
while also achieving competitive results on two publicly available standard
datasets, as SemanticKITTI and PandaSet. The code of our method is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenUrban3D is the first 3D open-vocabulary semantic segmentation framework for large-scale urban scenes that works without aligned multi-view images, pre-trained networks, or manual annotations, achieving superior segmentation accuracy and cross-scene generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation is crucial for urban point clouds in applications like digital twins and smart cities, but remains unexplored due to lack of aligned multi-view imagery and poor generalization of existing 3D segmentation methods across diverse urban environments.

Method: Generates semantic features directly from raw point clouds through multi-view, multi-granularity rendering, mask-level vision-language feature extraction, and sample-balanced fusion, followed by distillation into a 3D backbone model.

Result: Extensive experiments on SensatUrban and SUM benchmarks show significant improvements in both segmentation accuracy and cross-scene generalization over existing methods.

Conclusion: OpenUrban3D demonstrates potential as a flexible and scalable solution for 3D urban scene understanding, enabling zero-shot segmentation for arbitrary text queries while capturing semantic richness and geometric priors.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation enables models to recognize and segment
objects from arbitrary natural language descriptions, offering the flexibility
to handle novel, fine-grained, or functionally defined categories beyond fixed
label sets. While this capability is crucial for large-scale urban point clouds
that support applications such as digital twins, smart city management, and
urban analytics, it remains largely unexplored in this domain. The main
obstacles are the frequent absence of high-quality, well-aligned multi-view
imagery in large-scale urban point cloud datasets and the poor generalization
of existing three-dimensional (3D) segmentation pipelines across diverse urban
environments with substantial variation in geometry, scale, and appearance. To
address these challenges, we present OpenUrban3D, the first 3D open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation framework for large-scale urban scenes that operates
without aligned multi-view images, pre-trained point cloud segmentation
networks, or manual annotations. Our approach generates robust semantic
features directly from raw point clouds through multi-view, multi-granularity
rendering, mask-level vision-language feature extraction, and sample-balanced
fusion, followed by distillation into a 3D backbone model. This design enables
zero-shot segmentation for arbitrary text queries while capturing both semantic
richness and geometric priors. Extensive experiments on large-scale urban
benchmarks, including SensatUrban and SUM, show that OpenUrban3D achieves
significant improvements in both segmentation accuracy and cross-scene
generalization over existing methods, demonstrating its potential as a flexible
and scalable solution for 3D urban scene understanding.

*Aryan Kashyap Naveen,Bhuvanesh Singla,Raajan Wankhade,Shreesha M,Ramu S,Ram Mohana Reddy Guddeti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoOEP is an automated online exam proctoring system using dual-camera computer vision and LSTM networks to detect cheating behaviors with 90.7% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of online education requires scalable academic integrity solutions, as traditional human proctoring is not feasible at scale and existing automated solutions are either intrusive or ineffective at detecting various cheating behaviors.

Method: Uses dual-camera setup (frontal and side views) with computer vision modules: Face Module for identity verification (ArcFace), head pose estimation, gaze tracking, and mouth movement analysis; Hand Module with fine-tuned YOLOv11 for prohibited item detection. Features are aggregated into an LSTM network for temporal pattern analysis and real-time cheating probability scoring.

Result: Achieves 90.7% accuracy in suspicious activity classification, 0.57 mAP@.5 for prohibited item detection, and processes video streams at 2.4 FPS without GPU. Demonstrates effective and resource-efficient automated proctoring.

Conclusion: AutoOEP provides an effective, scalable solution for online exam integrity that significantly reduces human intervention needs while maintaining high detection accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The burgeoning of online education has created an urgent need for robust and
scalable systems to ensure academic integrity during remote examinations.
Traditional human proctoring is often not feasible at scale, while existing
automated solutions can be intrusive or fail to detect a wide range of cheating
behaviors. This paper introduces AutoOEP (Automated Online Exam Proctoring), a
comprehensive, multi-modal framework that leverages computer vision and machine
learning to provide effective, automated proctoring. The system utilizes a
dual-camera setup to capture both a frontal view of the examinee and a side
view of the workspace, minimizing blind spots. Our approach integrates several
parallel analyses: the Face Module performs continuous identity verification
using ArcFace, along with head pose estimation, gaze tracking, and mouth
movement analysis to detect suspicious cues. Concurrently, the Hand Module
employs a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model for detecting prohibited items (e.g., mobile
phones, notes) and tracks hand proximity to these objects. Features from these
modules are aggregated and fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network
that analyzes temporal patterns to calculate a real-time cheating probability
score. We evaluate AutoOEP on a custom-collected dataset simulating diverse
exam conditions. Our system achieves an accuracy of 90.7% in classifying
suspicious activities. The object detection component obtains a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.57 for prohibited items, and the entire framework
processes video streams at approximately 2.4 frames per second without a GPU.
The results demonstrate that AutoOEP is an effective and resource-efficient
solution for automated proctoring, significantly reducing the need for human
intervention and enhancing the integrity of online assessments.

*Weiqiang Zhao,Tianzhu Liu,Yuzhe Gui,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-camera CASSI framework using TV subgradient theory to improve spectral image reconstruction with better interpretability and performance than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in compressive spectral imaging where high compression ratios create ill-posed reconstruction problems, and existing methods lack interpretability or rely on handcrafted priors.

Method: Dual-camera CASSI with total variation subgradient theory, dynamic regularization using RGB/panchromatic reference images, and adaptive reference generation from auxiliary cameras.

Result: Effectively preserves spatial-spectral structural consistency and demonstrates robust performance across diverse reconstruction scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides an interpretable mathematical foundation for computational spectral imaging with improved reconstruction quality and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Spectral imaging technology has long-faced fundamental challenges in
balancing spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. While compressive
sensing-based Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI) mitigates this
trade-off through optical encoding, high compression ratios result in ill-posed
reconstruction problems. Traditional model-based methods exhibit limited
performance due to reliance on handcrafted inherent image priors, while deep
learning approaches are constrained by their black-box nature, which
compromises physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose
a dual-camera CASSI reconstruction framework that integrates total variation
(TV) subgradient theory. By establishing an end-to-end SD-CASSI mathematical
model, we reduce the computational complexity of solving the inverse problem
and provide a mathematically well-founded framework for analyzing multi-camera
systems. A dynamic regularization strategy is introduced, incorporating
normalized gradient constraints from RGB/panchromatic-derived reference images,
which constructs a TV subgradient similarity function with strict convex
optimization guarantees. Leveraging spatial priors from auxiliary cameras, an
adaptive reference generation and updating mechanism is designed to provide
subgradient guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively preserves spatial-spectral structural consistency. The theoretical
framework establishes an interpretable mathematical foundation for
computational spectral imaging, demonstrating robust performance across diverse
reconstruction scenarios. The source code is available at

*Mohanad Albughdadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A compact 2.5M-parameter metadata-aware mixture-of-experts masked autoencoder (MoE-MAE) that combines sparse expert routing with geo-temporal conditioning, achieving competitive performance with much larger models in Earth Observation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale Earth Observation foundation models are computationally expensive, limiting accessibility and reuse for downstream tasks. The authors aim to develop compact, efficient models that maintain strong performance.

Method: Proposed MoE-MAE architecture with metadata integration (latitude/longitude, seasonal/daily cyclic encodings alongside imagery). Pretrained on BigEarthNet-Landsat dataset and evaluated using linear probes on frozen encoder embeddings.

Result: Despite small size (2.5M parameters), the model competes with much larger architectures. Metadata-aware pretraining improves transfer and label efficiency. Maintains competitive performance on EuroSAT-Landsat dataset without explicit metadata.

Conclusion: Compact, metadata-aware MoE-MAEs represent an efficient and scalable approach for future Earth Observation foundation models, demonstrating that small models can achieve performance comparable to much larger architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in Earth Observation have focused on large-scale foundation
models. However, these models are computationally expensive, limiting their
accessibility and reuse for downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate
compact architectures as a practical pathway toward smaller general-purpose EO
models. We propose a Metadata-aware Mixture-of-Experts Masked Autoencoder
(MoE-MAE) with only 2.5M parameters. The model combines sparse expert routing
with geo-temporal conditioning, incorporating imagery alongside
latitude/longitude and seasonal/daily cyclic encodings. We pretrain the MoE-MAE
on the BigEarthNet-Landsat dataset and evaluate embeddings from its frozen
encoder using linear probes. Despite its small size, the model competes with
much larger architectures, demonstrating that metadata-aware pretraining
improves transfer and label efficiency. To further assess generalization, we
evaluate on the EuroSAT-Landsat dataset, which lacks explicit metadata, and
still observe competitive performance compared to models with hundreds of
millions of parameters. These results suggest that compact, metadata-aware
MoE-MAEs are an efficient and scalable step toward future EO foundation models.

*Farhan Sadik,Christopher L. Newman,Stuart J. Warden,Rachel K. Surowiec*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed ESWGAN-GP model with edge-enhancing skip connections and self-attention to correct motion artifacts in HR-pQCT bone imaging, achieving improved SNR, SSIM, and VIF metrics on both simulated and real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rigid-motion artifacts hinder in vivo assessment of bone microstructures in HR-pQCT, and existing methods lack standardized degradation models for motion correction.

Method: Optimized sinogram-based method to simulate motion artifacts, creating paired datasets. Proposed Edge-enhanced Self-attention WGAN-GP with VGG-based perceptual loss to preserve trabecular edges and capture long-range dependencies.

Result: Achieved mean SNR of 26.78, SSIM of 0.81, VIF of 0.76 on source dataset; improved to SNR 29.31, SSIM 0.87, VIF 0.81 on target dataset.

Conclusion: The methods represent an important initial step toward implementing deep learning-based motion correction in HR-pQCT, though they address a simplified representation of real-world motion complexity.

Abstract: Rigid-motion artifacts, such as cortical bone streaking and trabecular
smearing, hinder in vivo assessment of bone microstructures in high-resolution
peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Despite various motion
grading techniques, no motion correction methods exist due to the lack of
standardized degradation models. We optimize a conventional sinogram-based
method to simulate motion artifacts in HR-pQCT images, creating paired datasets
of motion-corrupted images and their corresponding ground truth, which enables
seamless integration into supervised learning frameworks for motion correction.
As such, we propose an Edge-enhanced Self-attention Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (ESWGAN-GP) to address motion
artifacts in both simulated (source) and real-world (target) datasets. The
model incorporates edge-enhancing skip connections to preserve trabecular edges
and self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, facilitating
motion correction. A visual geometry group (VGG)-based perceptual loss is used
to reconstruct fine micro-structural features. The ESWGAN-GP achieves a mean
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 26.78, structural similarity index measure
(SSIM) of 0.81, and visual information fidelity (VIF) of 0.76 for the source
dataset, while showing improved performance on the target dataset with an SNR
of 29.31, SSIM of 0.87, and VIF of 0.81. The proposed methods address a
simplified representation of real-world motion that may not fully capture the
complexity of in vivo motion artifacts. Nevertheless, because motion artifacts
present one of the foremost challenges to more widespread adoption of this
modality, these methods represent an important initial step toward implementing
deep learning-based motion correction in HR-pQCT.

TL;DR: Analysis of factors affecting gaze-based authentication performance using large-scale VR dataset, examining signal quality, calibration methods, and filtering effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify key factors that influence the performance of state-of-the-art gaze-based authentication systems, particularly in VR/AR contexts using modern hardware.

Method: Conducted experiments on a large dataset of 8,849 subjects using Meta Quest Pro equivalent hardware with 72Hz video oculography. Employed state-of-the-art neural network architecture to study effects of eye tracking signal quality, calibration aspects, and gaze filtering.

Result: Found that using same calibration target depth, fusing calibrated and non-calibrated gaze, and improving signal quality all enhance authentication performance. A simple three-sample moving average filter generally reduces performance, with some exceptions noted.

Conclusion: Specific calibration strategies and signal quality improvements significantly boost gaze authentication accuracy, while simple filtering may negatively impact performance, providing practical guidance for implementing effective gaze-based authentication systems.

Abstract: This paper examines the key factors that influence the performance of
state-of-the-art gaze-based authentication. Experiments were conducted on a
large-scale, in-house dataset comprising 8,849 subjects collected with Meta
Quest Pro equivalent hardware running a video oculography-driven gaze
estimation pipeline at 72Hz. The state-of-the-art neural network architecture
was employed to study the influence of the following factors on authentication
performance: eye tracking signal quality, various aspects of eye tracking
calibration, and simple filtering on estimated raw gaze. We found that using
the same calibration target depth for eye tracking calibration, fusing
calibrated and non-calibrated gaze, and improving eye tracking signal quality
all enhance authentication performance. We also found that a simple
three-sample moving average filter slightly reduces authentication performance
in general. While these findings hold true for the most part, some exceptions
were noted.

TL;DR: TrueSkin dataset with 7,299 images addresses skin tone recognition and generation challenges, revealing biases in existing models and showing significant improvements when used for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin tone recognition and generation are crucial for model fairness, healthcare, and generative AI, but current approaches struggle due to lack of comprehensive datasets and robust methodologies.

Method: Introduced TrueSkin dataset with 7,299 images systematically categorized into 6 classes under diverse conditions. Used it to benchmark existing recognition and generation approaches, and trained/fine-tuned models on this dataset.

Result: LMMs misclassify intermediate skin tones as lighter ones; generative models struggle with accurate skin tone production due to biases from unrelated prompt attributes. Training on TrueSkin improved classification accuracy by >20% and significantly enhanced skin tone fidelity in generation models.

Conclusion: TrueSkin serves as both a benchmark for evaluation and valuable training resource to enhance fairness and accuracy in skin tone recognition and generation tasks, highlighting the need for comprehensive datasets.

Abstract: Skin tone recognition and generation play important roles in model fairness,
healthcare, and generative AI, yet they remain challenging due to the lack of
comprehensive datasets and robust methodologies. Compared to other human image
analysis tasks, state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs) and image
generation models struggle to recognize and synthesize skin tones accurately.
To address this, we introduce TrueSkin, a dataset with 7299 images
systematically categorized into 6 classes, collected under diverse lighting
conditions, camera angles, and capture settings. Using TrueSkin, we benchmark
existing recognition and generation approaches, revealing substantial biases:
LMMs tend to misclassify intermediate skin tones as lighter ones, whereas
generative models struggle to accurately produce specified skin tones when
influenced by inherent biases from unrelated attributes in the prompts, such as
hairstyle or environmental context. We further demonstrate that training a
recognition model on TrueSkin improves classification accuracy by more than
20\% compared to LMMs and conventional approaches, and fine-tuning with
TrueSkin significantly improves skin tone fidelity in image generation models.
Our findings highlight the need for comprehensive datasets like TrueSkin, which
not only serves as a benchmark for evaluating existing models but also provides
a valuable training resource to enhance fairness and accuracy in skin tone
recognition and generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited labeled training data for animal monitoring and the challenge of selecting optimal pre-trained models from numerous neural network architectures, especially for researchers new to the field.

Method: Reinforcement learning framework with upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm to systematically evaluate and rank pre-trained models for animal detection tasks.

Result: Achieved higher detection rate while requiring significantly less computational time compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-based transfer learning framework provides an efficient automated solution for model selection in animal detection applications with limited data.

Abstract: Animal health monitoring and population management are critical aspects of
wildlife conservation and livestock management that increasingly rely on
automated detection and tracking systems. While Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
based systems combined with computer vision offer promising solutions for
non-invasive animal monitoring across challenging terrains, limited
availability of labeled training data remains an obstacle in developing
effective deep learning (DL) models for these applications. Transfer learning
has emerged as a potential solution, allowing models trained on large datasets
to be adapted for resource-limited scenarios such as those with limited data.
However, the vast landscape of pre-trained neural network architectures makes
it challenging to select optimal models, particularly for researchers new to
the field. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based
transfer learning framework that employs an upper confidence bound (UCB)
algorithm to automatically select the most suitable pre-trained model for
animal detection tasks. Our approach systematically evaluates and ranks
candidate models based on their performance, streamlining the model selection
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a higher
detection rate while requiring significantly less computational time compared
to traditional methods.

TL;DR: A prototypical network approach for few-shot fungal species recognition that outperforms the competition baseline by over 30% in Recall@5, effectively handling imbalanced data and rare species identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of automatic fungal species recognition with highly imbalanced class distributions and few training samples for rare species, supporting biodiversity monitoring and mycological research.

Method: Proposed a robust deep learning method based on prototypical networks that enhances prototype representations for few-shot fungal classification.

Result: Exceeded the competition baseline by more than 30 percentage points in Recall@5 on both public and private leaderboards, demonstrating strong performance for both common and rare species.

Conclusion: The prototypical network approach shows strong potential for accurate fungal species identification, particularly for rare and under-documented taxa, supporting the objectives of FungiCLEF 2025.

Abstract: The FungiCLEF 2025 competition addresses the challenge of automatic fungal
species recognition using realistic, field-collected observational data.
Accurate identification tools support both mycologists and citizen scientists,
greatly enhancing large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Effective recognition
systems in this context must handle highly imbalanced class distributions and
provide reliable performance even when very few training samples are available
for many species, especially rare and under-documented taxa that are often
missing from standard training sets. According to competition organizers, about
20\% of all verified fungi observations, representing nearly 20,000 instances,
are associated with these rarely recorded species. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a robust deep learning method based on prototypical networks, which
enhances prototype representations for few-shot fungal classification. Our
prototypical network approach exceeds the competition baseline by more than 30
percentage points in Recall@5 on both the public (PB) and private (PR)
leaderboards. This demonstrates strong potential for accurately identifying
both common and rare fungal species, supporting the main objectives of
FungiCLEF 2025.

*Yuedi Zhang,Zhixiang Xia,Guosheng Yin,Bin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: csMIL is a novel Multi-Instance Learning framework that uses global-local clustering and cluster-level sparsity to handle redundant instances in weakly labeled datasets like whole-slide images, achieving state-of-the-art performance on histopathology benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MIL methods struggle with instance redundancy and lack mechanisms to discard non-informative instances, limiting robustness and interpretability in applications like computational pathology.

Method: csMIL performs global clustering across all bags to establish cluster centers, then local clustering within each bag. It computes attention scores within clusters and applies sparse regularization to cluster weights to selectively retain relevant clusters while discarding irrelevant ones.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows csMIL requires O(s log K) bags to recover s relevant clusters. Empirically, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on CAMELYON16 and TCGA-NSCLC histopathology benchmarks.

Conclusion: csMIL enhances robustness to noisy instances, improves interpretability by identifying critical regions, reduces computational complexity, and provides a principled approach for handling instance redundancy in MIL problems.

Abstract: Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) is pivotal for analyzing complex, weakly
labeled datasets, such as whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology,
where bags comprise unordered collections of instances with sparse diagnostic
relevance. Traditional MIL approaches, including early statistical methods and
recent attention-based frameworks, struggle with instance redundancy and lack
explicit mechanisms for discarding non-informative instances, limiting their
robustness and interpretability. We propose Cluster-level Sparse MIL (csMIL), a
novel framework that integrates global-local instance clustering,
within-cluster attention, and cluster-level sparsity induction to address these
challenges. Our csMIL first performs global clustering across all bags to
establish $K$ cluster centers, followed by local clustering within each bag to
assign cluster labels. Attention scores are computed within each cluster, and
sparse regularization is applied to cluster weights, enabling the selective
retention of diagnostically relevant clusters while discarding irrelevant ones.
This approach enhances robustness to noisy instances, improves interpretability
by identifying critical regions, and reduces computational complexity.

*Canhui Tang,Sanping Zhou,Haoyue Shi,Le Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel zero-shot video anomaly detection framework using skeleton data with action typicality and uniqueness learning, achieving state-of-the-art results without target domain training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ZS-VAD is crucial for practical applications like data privacy and new surveillance deployments. Skeleton-based approaches have inherent generalizability advantages but existing methods only learn low-level representations and rely on domain-limited normality boundaries.

Method: Two-module approach: 1) Language-guided semantic typicality modeling that projects skeleton snippets into action semantic space using LLM knowledge, 2) Test-time context uniqueness analysis to derive scene-adaptive boundaries by analyzing spatio-temporal differences.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results against skeleton-based methods on four large-scale VAD datasets (ShanghaiTech, UBnormal, NWPU, UCF-Crime) featuring over 100 unseen surveillance scenes without using target domain training samples.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully unlocks the potential of skeleton data for zero-shot video anomaly detection through action typicality and uniqueness learning, demonstrating strong generalization to new scenes with different normal/abnormal patterns.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Detection (ZS-VAD) requires temporally localizing
anomalies without target domain training data, which is a crucial task due to
various practical concerns, e.g., data privacy or new surveillance deployments.
Skeleton-based approach has inherent generalizable advantages in achieving
ZS-VAD as it eliminates domain disparities both in background and human
appearance. However, existing methods only learn low-level skeleton
representation and rely on the domain-limited normality boundary, which cannot
generalize well to new scenes with different normal and abnormal behavior
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video anomaly detection
framework, unlocking the potential of skeleton data via action typicality and
uniqueness learning. Firstly, we introduce a language-guided semantic
typicality modeling module that projects skeleton snippets into action semantic
space and distills LLM's knowledge of typical normal and abnormal behaviors
during training. Secondly, we propose a test-time context uniqueness analysis
module to finely analyze the spatio-temporal differences between skeleton
snippets and then derive scene-adaptive boundaries. Without using any training
samples from the target domain, our method achieves state-of-the-art results
against skeleton-based methods on four large-scale VAD datasets: ShanghaiTech,
UBnormal, NWPU, and UCF-Crime, featuring over 100 unseen surveillance scenes.

Conclusion: Organoid Tracker provides an extensible, open-source framework that accelerates kidney development research, PKD modeling, and therapeutic discovery by enabling detailed quantitative analysis without programming expertise.

Abstract: Recent advances in organoid models have revolutionized the study of human
kidney disease mechanisms and drug discovery by enabling scalable,
cost-effective research without the need for animal sacrifice. Here, we present
a kidney organoid platform optimized for efficient screening in polycystic
kidney disease (PKD). While these systems generate rich spatial-temporal

*Zongwu Xie,Kaijie Yun,Yang Liu,Yiming Ji,Han Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Robust multi-modal framework for planetary rover traversability prediction using camera and LiDAR fusion with self-supervised IMU-derived training, showing geometry dominates cost learning with high robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a reliable traversability costmap prediction system for planetary rovers that can handle challenging terrain conditions without requiring manual labeling, using self-supervised learning from sensor data.

Method: Fuses camera and LiDAR data to produce bird's-eye-view terrain costmaps using DINOv3-based image encoder and FiLM-based sensor fusion, trained self-supervised with IMU-derived labels and optimization loss combining Huber and smoothness terms.

Result: Highly robust model with minor performance changes under various ablation tests (MAE increases from ~0.0775 to 0.0915 when LiDAR sparsified), indicating geometry dominates learned cost and model resilience to input variations.

Conclusion: The framework provides a strong multi-modal BEV costmap prediction solution with contributions including high-fidelity simulation, self-supervised labeling pipeline, and robust model architecture, though limited by data diversity and requiring future work on domain generalization.

Abstract: We present a robust multi-modal framework for predicting traversability
costmaps for planetary rovers. Our model fuses camera and LiDAR data to produce
a bird's-eye-view (BEV) terrain costmap, trained self-supervised using
IMU-derived labels. Key updates include a DINOv3-based image encoder,
FiLM-based sensor fusion, and an optimization loss combining Huber and
smoothness terms. Experimental ablations (removing image color, occluding
inputs, adding noise) show only minor changes in MAE/MSE (e.g. MAE increases
from ~0.0775 to 0.0915 when LiDAR is sparsified), indicating that geometry
dominates the learned cost and the model is highly robust. We attribute the
small performance differences to the IMU labeling primarily reflecting terrain
geometry rather than semantics and to limited data diversity. Unlike prior work
claiming large gains, we emphasize our contributions: (1) a high-fidelity,
reproducible simulation environment; (2) a self-supervised IMU-based labeling
pipeline; and (3) a strong multi-modal BEV costmap prediction model. We discuss
limitations and future work such as domain generalization and dataset
expansion.

*Chao Chen,Shunyu Yao,Yuanwu He,Tao Feng,Ruojing Song,Yuliang Guo,Xinyu Huang,Chenxu Wu,Ren Liu,Chen Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAA-Policy is an end-to-end imitation learning system that uses control signals to guide visual attention learning, improving parking policy stability and performance over transformer-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end learning approaches lack effective synergy between perception and control, with transformer-based self-attention producing unstable spatial attention that undermines policy reliability over time.

Method: Proposes Control-Aided Attention (CAA) mechanism trained self-supervised using backpropagated gradients from control outputs, integrates short-horizon waypoint prediction, and adds a motion prediction module for robust target spot tracking.

Result: Extensive CARLA simulator experiments show CAA-Policy consistently surpasses end-to-end learning baseline and modular BEV segmentation + hybrid A* pipeline, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Conclusion: Using control signals to guide attention learning rather than just minimizing training loss leads to more robust and generalizable policies for precise parking tasks.

Abstract: Precise parking requires an end-to-end system where perception adaptively
provides policy-relevant details-especially in critical areas where fine
control decisions are essential. End-to-end learning offers a unified framework
by directly mapping sensor inputs to control actions, but existing approaches
lack effective synergy between perception and control. We find that
transformer-based self-attention, when used alone, tends to produce unstable
and temporally inconsistent spatial attention, which undermines the reliability
of downstream policy decisions over time. Instead, we propose CAA-Policy, an
end-to-end imitation learning system that allows control signal to guide the
learning of visual attention via a novel Control-Aided Attention (CAA)
mechanism. For the first time, we train such an attention module in a
self-supervised manner, using backpropagated gradients from the control outputs
instead of from the training loss. This strategy encourages the attention to
focus on visual features that induce high variance in action outputs, rather
than merely minimizing the training loss-a shift we demonstrate leads to a more
robust and generalizable policy. To further enhance stability, CAA-Policy
integrates short-horizon waypoint prediction as an auxiliary task, and
introduces a separately trained motion prediction module to robustly track the
target spot over time. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator show that
\titlevariable~consistently surpasses both the end-to-end learning baseline and
the modular BEV segmentation + hybrid A* pipeline, achieving superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability. Code is released at

*Zeyu Dong,Yuyang Yin,Yuqi Li,Eric Li,Hao-Xiang Guo,Yikai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt pretrained video diffusion models for high-quality 360° panoramic video generation, requiring only ~1,000 videos for fine-tuning while outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional perspective-view video generation models struggle with panoramic content due to fundamental projection differences. Existing solutions are complex, inefficient, and produce suboptimal results.

Method: Treats panoramic video generation as an adaptation problem using LoRA. Theoretically shows LoRA can model the transformation between perspective and panoramic projections when rank exceeds task degrees of freedom. Efficiently fine-tunes pretrained video diffusion models.

Result: Achieves high-quality panoramic generation with proper projection geometry. Surpasses previous state-of-the-art in visual quality, left-right consistency, and motion diversity.

Conclusion: LoRA-based adaptation provides an efficient and effective solution for panoramic video generation, requiring minimal training data while delivering superior results compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Generating high-quality 360{\deg} panoramic videos remains a significant
challenge due to the fundamental differences between panoramic and traditional
perspective-view projections. While perspective videos rely on a single
viewpoint with a limited field of view, panoramic content requires rendering
the full surrounding environment, making it difficult for standard video
generation models to adapt. Existing solutions often introduce complex
architectures or large-scale training, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal
results. Motivated by the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in style
transfer tasks, we propose treating panoramic video generation as an adaptation
problem from perspective views. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate
that LoRA can effectively model the transformation between these projections
when its rank exceeds the degrees of freedom in the task. Our approach
efficiently fine-tunes a pretrained video diffusion model using only
approximately 1,000 videos while achieving high-quality panoramic generation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains proper projection
geometry and surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality,
left-right consistency, and motion diversity.

*Ruiying Li,Bin Pan,Qiaoying Qu,Xia Xu,Zhenwei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMILE is a multi-task learning framework that integrates super-resolution with hyperspectral unmixing, providing theoretical validation of task affinity and convergence guarantees to enhance unmixing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral unmixing performance is limited by low spatial resolution. Direct integration of super-resolution and unmixing faces challenges with unverified task affinity and lack of convergence guarantees for unmixing.

Method: Proposes SMILE framework with theoretical analysis including relationship, existence, and accessibility theorems. Uses multi-task learning to generalize positive information from super-resolution to unmixing by learning both shared and specific representations.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real datasets substantiate the usefulness of the approach, demonstrating enhanced unmixing performance through super-resolution guidance.

Conclusion: SMILE provides both progressive theoretical support and a practical framework for improving hyperspectral unmixing under super-resolution guidance, with validated task affinity and convergence guarantees.

Abstract: The performance of hyperspectral unmixing may be constrained by low spatial
resolution, which can be enhanced using super-resolution in a multitask
learning way. However, integrating super-resolution and unmixing directly may
suffer two challenges: Task affinity is not verified, and the convergence of
unmixing is not guaranteed. To address the above issues, in this paper, we
provide theoretical analysis and propose super-resolution guided multi-task
learning method for hyperspectral unmixing (SMILE). The provided theoretical
analysis validates feasibility of multitask learning way and verifies task
affinity, which consists of relationship and existence theorems by proving the
positive guidance of super-resolution. The proposed framework generalizes
positive information from super-resolution to unmixing by learning both shared
and specific representations. Moreover, to guarantee the convergence, we
provide the accessibility theorem by proving the optimal solution of unmixing.
The major contributions of SMILE include providing progressive theoretical
support, and designing a new framework for unmixing under the guidance of
super-resolution. Our experiments on both synthetic and real datasets have
substantiate the usefulness of our work.

TL;DR: Proposes Cog-TD, a copula-guided temporal dependency method for multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing that explicitly models temporal dependencies using copula theory to capture dynamical material evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependency and fail to capture dynamical material evolution in multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing. Copula theory's ability to explicitly model dependency structures provides a promising solution.

Method: Defines a new mathematical model incorporating copula theory, constructs a copula-guided framework with two key modules: copula function estimation and temporal dependency guidance, which compute and employ temporal information to guide the unmixing process.

Result: Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of the proposed Cog-TD method for multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing with temporal dependency modeling.

Conclusion: The paper successfully redefines MTHU problem with temporal dependency, proposes a copula-guided framework, develops key modules with theoretical support, and demonstrates effectiveness through experiments, providing a novel approach for capturing dynamical material evolution.

Abstract: Multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing (MTHU) aims to model variable endmembers
and dynamical abundances, which emphasizes the critical temporal information.
However, existing methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependency,
thus fail to capture the dynamical material evolution. Motivated by the ability
of copula theory in modeling dependency structure explicitly, in this paper, we
propose a copula-guided temporal dependency method (Cog-TD) for multitemporal
hyperspectral unmixing. Cog-TD defines new mathematical model, constructs
copula-guided framework and provides two key modules with theoretical support.
The mathematical model provides explicit formulations for MTHU problem
definition, which describes temporal dependency structure by incorporating
copula theory. The copula-guided framework is constructed for utilizing copula
function, which estimates dynamical endmembers and abundances with temporal
dependency. The key modules consist of copula function estimation and temporal
dependency guidance, which computes and employs temporal information to guide
unmixing process. Moreover, the theoretical support demonstrates that estimated
copula function is valid and the represented temporal dependency exists in
hyperspectral images. The major contributions of this paper include redefining
MTHU problem with temporal dependency, proposing a copula-guided framework,
developing two key modules and providing theoretical support. Our experimental
results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of
the proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DAeroRelief is the first 3D benchmark dataset for post-disaster assessment, collected via UAVs over hurricane-damaged areas with dense 3D point clouds and semantic annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D benchmarks focus on urban/indoor scenes and lack disaster contexts, while 2D imagery has limitations like depth absence and occlusions for structural damage assessment.

Method: Used low-cost UAVs to collect data over hurricane-damaged regions, reconstructed dense 3D point clouds via Structure-from-Motion and Multi-View Stereo, with manual 2D labeling projected to 3D space.

Result: Created a dataset capturing large-scale outdoor environments with fine-grained structural damage in real disaster contexts, enabling evaluation of state-of-the-art 3D segmentation models.

Conclusion: 3DAeroRelief serves as a valuable resource for advancing robust 3D vision systems in post-disaster scenarios, highlighting challenges and opportunities for 3D scene understanding in disaster response.

Abstract: Timely assessment of structural damage is critical for disaster response and
recovery. However, most prior work in natural disaster analysis relies on 2D
imagery, which lacks depth, suffers from occlusions, and provides limited
spatial context. 3D semantic segmentation offers a richer alternative, but
existing 3D benchmarks focus mainly on urban or indoor scenes, with little
attention to disaster-affected areas. To address this gap, we present
3DAeroRelief--the first 3D benchmark dataset specifically designed for
post-disaster assessment. Collected using low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) over hurricane-damaged regions, the dataset features dense 3D point
clouds reconstructed via Structure-from-Motion and Multi-View Stereo
techniques. Semantic annotations were produced through manual 2D labeling and
projected into 3D space. Unlike existing datasets, 3DAeroRelief captures 3D
large-scale outdoor environments with fine-grained structural damage in
real-world disaster contexts. UAVs enable affordable, flexible, and safe data
collection in hazardous areas, making them particularly well-suited for
emergency scenarios. To demonstrate the utility of 3DAeroRelief, we evaluate
several state-of-the-art 3D segmentation models on the dataset to highlight
both the challenges and opportunities of 3D scene understanding in disaster
response. Our dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing robust 3D
vision systems in real-world applications for post-disaster scenarios.

*Nhi Kieu,Kien Nguyen,Arnold Wiliem,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEMMNet is a novel generative-enhanced multimodal network that addresses missing modality issues in remote sensing semantic segmentation by using hybrid feature extraction, multiscale fusion, and complementary loss to outperform existing generative and non-generative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal signals in real-world scenarios are prone to missing due to sensor failures and adverse weather, which severely degrades model performance. Existing generative approaches inadequately handle the heterogeneity of remote sensing data and suffer from bias towards dominant modalities.

Method: Proposes GEMMNet with three components: 1) Hybrid Feature Extractor (HyFEx) for modality-specific representations, 2) Hybrid Fusion with Multiscale Awareness (HyFMA) for cross-scale modality-synergistic context, and 3) Complementary Loss (CoLoss) to reduce bias by encouraging modality and task consistency.

Result: GEMMNet outperforms both generative baselines (AE, cGAN) and state-of-the-art non-generative approaches (mmformer, shaspec) on two challenging remote sensing semantic segmentation datasets (Vaihingen and Potsdam).

Conclusion: The proposed GEMMNet effectively addresses missing modality challenges in remote sensing by capturing semantic context across scales while reducing bias, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods in multimodal semantic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has shown significant performance boost compared to
ordinary unimodal models across various domains. However, in real-world
scenarios, multimodal signals are susceptible to missing because of sensor
failures and adverse weather conditions, which drastically deteriorates models'
operation and performance. Generative models such as AutoEncoder (AE) and
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are intuitive solutions aiming to
reconstruct missing modality from available ones. Yet, their efficacy in remote
sensing semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this paper, we first
examine the limitations of existing generative approaches in handling the
heterogeneity of multimodal remote sensing data. They inadequately capture
semantic context in complex scenes with large intra-class and small inter-class
variation. In addition, traditional generative models are susceptible to heavy
dependence on the dominant modality, introducing bias that affects model
robustness under missing modality conditions. To tackle these limitations, we
propose a novel Generative-Enhanced MultiModal learning Network (GEMMNet) with
three key components: (1) Hybrid Feature Extractor (HyFEx) to effectively learn
modality-specific representations, (2) Hybrid Fusion with Multiscale Awareness
(HyFMA) to capture modality-synergistic semantic context across scales and (3)
Complementary Loss (CoLoss) scheme to alleviate the inherent bias by
encouraging consistency across modalities and tasks. Our method, GEMMNet,
outperforms both generative baselines AE, cGAN (conditional GAN), and
state-of-the-art non-generative approaches - mmformer and shaspec - on two
challenging semantic segmentation remote sensing datasets (Vaihingen and
Potsdam). Source code is made available.

Motivation: Current fluid reconstruction methods require controlled lab environments, leaving real-world videos largely unexplored despite recent advances in 3D vision and fluid dynamics rendering.

Method: Targeted techniques including smoke extraction with background removal, initialization of smoke particles and camera poses, and inferring multi-view videos to address three key challenges of reconstructing smoke from real-world videos.

Result: Outperforms previous reconstruction and generation methods with +2.22 average PSNR improvement on wild videos, and enables diverse realistic editing of fluid dynamics through simulation.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges the gap between controlled lab environments and real-world video capture for smoke reconstruction, providing high-quality 4D smoke assets that support interactive design and editing applications.

Abstract: We propose a pipeline to extract and reconstruct dynamic 3D smoke assets from
a single in-the-wild video, and further integrate interactive simulation for
smoke design and editing. Recent developments in 3D vision have significantly
improved reconstructing and rendering fluid dynamics, supporting realistic and
temporally consistent view synthesis. However, current fluid reconstructions
rely heavily on carefully controlled clean lab environments, whereas real-world
videos captured in the wild are largely underexplored. We pinpoint three key
challenges of reconstructing smoke in real-world videos and design targeted
techniques, including smoke extraction with background removal, initialization
of smoke particles and camera poses, and inferring multi-view videos. Our
method not only outperforms previous reconstruction and generation methods with
high-quality smoke reconstructions (+2.22 average PSNR on wild videos), but

*Ashkan Taghipour,Vahid Naghshin,Benjamin Southwell,Farid Boussaid,Hamid Laga,Mohammed Bennamoun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVR-GS introduces spatially variant regularization for 3D Gaussian Splatting, reducing Gaussian count by 1.79× vs MaskGS and 5.63× vs 3DGS with minimal PSNR loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mask-based pruning methods use global mean regularization that doesn't align with per-pixel reconstruction loss, leading to suboptimal sparsity.

Method: Proposes SVR-GS with per-pixel spatial masks from each Gaussian's ray contribution, implementing three spatial-mask aggregation strategies in CUDA with gradient analysis.

Result: Achieves average Gaussian reduction of 1.79× vs MaskGS and 5.63× vs 3DGS with only 0.50 dB and 0.40 dB PSNR drops respectively across Tanks&Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets.

Conclusion: SVR-GS produces significantly smaller, faster, and more memory-efficient models suitable for real-time applications like robotics, AR/VR, and mobile perception.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables fast, high-quality novel view synthesis
but typically relies on densification followed by pruning to optimize the
number of Gaussians. Existing mask-based pruning, such as MaskGS, regularizes
the global mean of the mask, which is misaligned with the local per-pixel
(per-ray) reconstruction loss that determines image quality along individual
camera rays. This paper introduces SVR-GS, a spatially variant regularizer that
renders a per-pixel spatial mask from each Gaussian's effective contribution
along the ray, thereby applying sparsity pressure where it matters: on
low-importance Gaussians. We explore three spatial-mask aggregation strategies,
implement them in CUDA, and conduct a gradient analysis to motivate our final
design. Extensive experiments on Tanks\&Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF360
datasets demonstrate that, on average across the three datasets, the proposed
SVR-GS reduces the number of Gaussians by 1.79\(\times\) compared to MaskGS and
5.63\(\times\) compared to 3DGS, while incurring only 0.50 dB and 0.40 dB PSNR
drops, respectively. These gains translate into significantly smaller, faster,
and more memory-efficient models, making them well-suited for real-time
applications such as robotics, AR/VR, and mobile perception.

TL;DR: A lightweight learning framework that predicts 3D volume and surface area of corals from 2D multi-view RGB images using pre-trained feature extraction and dual DGCNN decoders with uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective reef monitoring requires accurate coral volumetric and surface area quantification, but complex coral morphologies make this challenging. Current methods need scalable solutions for coral growth analysis from sparse image data.

Method: Uses pre-trained VGGT module to extract dense point maps from multi-view RGB images, merges them into unified point clouds with confidence scores, then processes through parallel DGCNN decoder heads to jointly predict volume and surface area with uncertainty estimates using Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy in coral geometry estimation and demonstrates good generalization to unseen coral morphologies.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient and scalable coral geometry estimation directly from sparse image sets, with potential applications in coral growth analysis and reef monitoring programs.

Abstract: Effective reef monitoring requires the quantification of coral growth via
accurate volumetric and surface area estimates, which is a challenging task due
to the complex morphology of corals. We propose a novel, lightweight, and
scalable learning framework that addresses this challenge by predicting the 3D
volume and surface area of coral-like objects from 2D multi-view RGB images.
Our approach utilizes a pre-trained module (VGGT) to extract dense point maps
from each view; these maps are merged into a unified point cloud and enriched
with per-view confidence scores. The resulting cloud is fed to two parallel
DGCNN decoder heads, which jointly output the volume and the surface area of
the coral, as well as their corresponding confidence estimate. To enhance
prediction stability and provide uncertainty estimates, we introduce a
composite loss function based on Gaussian negative log-likelihood in both real
and log domains. Our method achieves competitive accuracy and generalizes well
to unseen morphologies. This framework paves the way for efficient and scalable
coral geometry estimation directly from a sparse set of images, with potential
applications in coral growth analysis and reef monitoring.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TrafficQA and DriveQA benchmarks, with remarkable zero-shot reasoning and cross-scenario generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Traffic-MLLM significantly enhances continuous spatiotemporal feature modeling and logical reasoning for multimodal traffic data analysis through its specialized architecture and knowledge integration approach.

Abstract: As intelligent transportation systems advance, traffic video understanding
plays an increasingly pivotal role in comprehensive scene perception and causal
analysis. Yet, existing approaches face notable challenges in accurately
modeling spatiotemporal causality and integrating domain-specific knowledge,
limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose Traffic-MLLM, a multimodal large language model
tailored for fine-grained traffic analysis. Built on the Qwen2.5-VL backbone,
our model leverages high-quality traffic-specific multimodal datasets and uses
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for lightweight fine-tuning, significantly enhancing
its capacity to model continuous spatiotemporal features in video sequences.
Furthermore, we introduce an innovative knowledge prompting module fusing
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
enabling precise injection of detailed traffic regulations and domain knowledge
into the inference process. This design markedly boosts the model's logical
reasoning and knowledge adaptation capabilities. Experimental results on
TrafficQA and DriveQA benchmarks show Traffic-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, validating its superior ability to process multimodal traffic
data. It also exhibits remarkable zero-shot reasoning and cross-scenario
generalization capabilities.

### [41] [Multispectral-NeRF:a multispectral modeling approach based on neural radiance fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11169)
*Hong Zhang,Fei Guo,Zihan Xie,Dizhao Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multispectral-NeRF extends NeRF to handle 6-band spectral data instead of just RGB, improving 3D reconstruction accuracy and spectral fidelity through architectural modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D reconstruction relies on RGB data, but multispectral sensors provide additional spectral bands. Existing multispectral methods have high costs, low accuracy, and poor geometry. NeRF-based approaches can solve these issues but currently only work with 3-band data.

Method: Enhanced neural architecture derived from NeRF with three key modifications: expanded hidden layers for 6-band inputs, redesigned residual functions for spectral discrepancy optimization, and adapted data compression modules for higher bit-depth multispectral imagery.

Result: Experimental results show Multispectral-NeRF successfully processes multi-band spectral features while accurately preserving original scenes' spectral characteristics.

Conclusion: The proposed Multispectral-NeRF effectively addresses the limitations of current multispectral 3D reconstruction methods by extending NeRF to handle multi-band spectral data, producing high-precision reconstruction results with preserved spectral fidelity.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction technology generates three-dimensional representations of
real-world objects, scenes, or environments using sensor data such as 2D
images, with extensive applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and
virtual reality systems. Traditional 3D reconstruction techniques based on 2D
images typically relies on RGB spectral information. With advances in sensor
technology, additional spectral bands beyond RGB have been increasingly
incorporated into 3D reconstruction workflows. Existing methods that integrate
these expanded spectral data often suffer from expensive scheme prices, low
accuracy and poor geometric features. Three - dimensional reconstruction based
on NeRF can effectively address the various issues in current multispectral 3D
reconstruction methods, producing high - precision and high - quality
reconstruction results. However, currently, NeRF and some improved models such
as NeRFacto are trained on three - band data and cannot take into account the
multi - band information. To address this problem, we propose
Multispectral-NeRF, an enhanced neural architecture derived from NeRF that can
effectively integrates multispectral information. Our technical contributions
comprise threefold modifications: Expanding hidden layer dimensionality to
accommodate 6-band spectral inputs; Redesigning residual functions to optimize
spectral discrepancy calculations between reconstructed and reference images;
Adapting data compression modules to address the increased bit-depth
requirements of multispectral imagery. Experimental results confirm that
Multispectral-NeRF successfully processes multi-band spectral features while
accurately preserving the original scenes' spectral characteristics.

*Zhiwen Yang,Yuxin Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPHERE integrates voxel and Gaussian representations for 3D semantic scene completion, using semantic-guided Gaussian initialization and physical-aware harmonics enhancement to achieve realistic geometric details with semantic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing voxel-based and plane-based SSC methods struggle to capture physical regularities for realistic geometric details, while neural reconstruction methods like NeRF and 3DGS suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence in large-scale autonomous driving scenes.

Method: Proposes SPHERE with two modules: 1) Semantic-guided Gaussian Initialization (SGI) that uses dual-branch 3D scene representations to locate focal voxels as anchors for efficient Gaussian initialization, and 2) Physical-aware Harmonics Enhancement (PHE) that incorporates semantic spherical harmonics to model physical-aware contextual details and promote semantic-geometry consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of SPHERE, achieving superior performance in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

Conclusion: SPHERE successfully integrates voxel and Gaussian representations to jointly exploit semantic and physical information, generating SSC results with realistic details while maintaining computational efficiency in large-scale autonomous driving scenes.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a critical task in
autonomous driving systems, assessing voxel-level geometry and semantics for
holistic scene perception. While existing voxel-based and plane-based SSC
methods have achieved considerable progress, they struggle to capture physical
regularities for realistic geometric details. On the other hand, neural
reconstruction methods like NeRF and 3DGS demonstrate superior physical
awareness, but suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence when
handling large-scale, complex autonomous driving scenes, leading to inferior
semantic accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Semantic-PHysical
Engaged REpresentation (SPHERE) for camera-based SSC, which integrates voxel
and Gaussian representations for joint exploitation of semantic and physical
information. First, the Semantic-guided Gaussian Initialization (SGI) module
leverages dual-branch 3D scene representations to locate focal voxels as
anchors to guide efficient Gaussian initialization. Then, the Physical-aware
Harmonics Enhancement (PHE) module incorporates semantic spherical harmonics to
model physical-aware contextual details and promote semantic-geometry
consistency through focal distribution alignment, generating SSC results with
realistic details. Extensive experiments and analyses on the popular
SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
SPHERE. The code is available at

### [43] [StegOT: Trade-offs in Steganography via Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11178)
*Chengde Lin,Xuezhu Gong,Shuxue Ding,Mingzhe Yang,Xijun Lu,Chengjun Mo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StegOT is an autoencoder-based image steganography model that uses optimal transport theory to address mode collapse issues in existing GAN/VAE-based methods, achieving better information balance between cover and secret images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing steganography models based on GANs and VAEs suffer from mode collapse, which causes information imbalance between cover and secret images in the stego image and negatively affects extraction quality.

Method: Proposes StegOT with a multiple channel optimal transport (MCOT) module that transforms multi-peak feature distributions into single-peak distributions to achieve information trade-off between cover and secret images.

Result: Experiments show the model achieves better trade-off between cover and secret images while enhancing quality of both stego and recovery images.

Conclusion: StegOT effectively addresses mode collapse in image steganography through optimal transport theory, improving information balance and image quality in both hiding and extraction processes.

Abstract: Image hiding is often referred to as steganography, which aims to hide a
secret image in a cover image of the same resolution. Many steganography models
are based on genera-tive adversarial networks (GANs) and variational
autoencoders (VAEs). However, most existing models suffer from mode collapse.
Mode collapse will lead to an information imbalance between the cover and
secret images in the stego image and further affect the subsequent extraction.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes StegOT, an autoencoder-based
steganography model incorporating optimal transport theory. We designed the
multiple channel optimal transport (MCOT) module to transform the feature
distribution, which exhibits multiple peaks, into a single peak to achieve the
trade-off of information. Experiments demonstrate that we not only achieve a
trade-off between the cover and secret images but also enhance the quality of
both the stego and recovery images. The source code will be released on
https://github.com/Rss1124/StegOT.

### [44] [The Impact of Skin Tone Label Granularity on the Performance and Fairness of AI Based Dermatology Image Classification Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11184)
*Partha Shah,Durva Sankhe,Maariyah Rashid,Zakaa Khaled,Esther Puyol-Antón,Tiarna Lee,Maram Alqarni,Sweta Rai,Andrew P. King*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study shows FST scale granularity affects AI skin lesion classification performance and bias, recommending transition to more representative skin tone scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI skin lesion classification models show bias based on skin tone, and the commonly used Fitzpatrick Skin Tone (FST) scale has criticized granularity issues with better representation for lighter skin tones.

Method: Trained multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions using FST-specific data with different granularity levels (three groups: FST 1/2, 3/4, 5/6 vs. reduced granularity approaches).

Result: Models trained on FST-specific three-group data performed better than general FST-balanced models, but reducing FST granularity (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) negatively impacted performance.

Conclusion: FST scale granularity significantly impacts AI model performance and bias, suggesting need to move away from FST scale to alternative scales that better represent human skin tone diversity for fair AI research.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) models to automatically classify skin lesions
from dermatology images have shown promising performance but also
susceptibility to bias by skin tone. The most common way of representing skin
tone information is the Fitzpatrick Skin Tone (FST) scale. The FST scale has
been criticised for having greater granularity in its skin tone categories for
lighter-skinned subjects. This paper conducts an investigation of the impact
(on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST
scale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions
using FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when
training models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and
5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data
compared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the
granularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a
detrimental effect on performance. Our results highlight the importance of the
granularity of FST groups when training lesion classification models. Given the
question marks over possible human biases in the choice of categories in the
FST scale, this paper provides evidence for a move away from the FST scale in
fair AI research and a transition to an alternative scale that better
represents the diversity of human skin tones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic forest data generation pipeline using game engines and LiDAR simulation reduces need for real labeled data in tree segmentation, achieving competitive results with minimal real data fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D forest datasets are too small for robust tree segmentation systems, and synthetic data has shown success in other domains like self-driving, suggesting potential for forest vision tasks.

Method: Developed synthetic data generation pipeline integrating game engines with physics-based LiDAR simulation to create large-scale annotated 3D forest dataset, then used synthetic data for pretraining with minimal real forest plot annotation for fine-tuning.

Result: After fine-tuning on just a single real forest plot (<0.1 hectare), the pretrained model achieves segmentations competitive with models trained on full-scale real data, substantially reducing need for labeled real data.

Conclusion: Synthetic data with physics, diversity, and scale can enable robust 3D forest vision systems, with critical success factors identified for synthetic data usage in this domain.

Abstract: Accurate tree segmentation is a key step in extracting individual tree
metrics from forest laser scans, and is essential to understanding ecosystem
functions in carbon cycling and beyond. Over the past decade, tree segmentation
algorithms have advanced rapidly due to developments in AI. However existing,
public, 3D forest datasets are not large enough to build robust tree
segmentation systems. Motivated by the success of synthetic data in other
domains such as self-driving, we investigate whether similar approaches can
help with tree segmentation. In place of expensive field data collection and
annotation, we use synthetic data during pretraining, and then require only
minimal, real forest plot annotation for fine-tuning.
  We have developed a new synthetic data generation pipeline to do this for
forest vision tasks, integrating advances in game-engines with physics-based
LiDAR simulation. As a result, we have produced a comprehensive, diverse,
annotated 3D forest dataset on an unprecedented scale. Extensive experiments
with a state-of-the-art tree segmentation algorithm and a popular real dataset
show that our synthetic data can substantially reduce the need for labelled
real data. After fine-tuning on just a single, real, forest plot of less than
0.1 hectare, the pretrained model achieves segmentations that are competitive
with a model trained on the full scale real data. We have also identified
critical factors for successful use of synthetic data: physics, diversity, and
scale, paving the way for more robust 3D forest vision systems in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept sliders struggle with no-AIGC images and real-world captured images, creating a need for more robust image manipulation methods that work across diverse image categories.

Method: Integrates GANs and diffusion models with fine-grained textual and visual guidance in an adversarial manner to refine images and improve manipulation capabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments show marked enhancement in image quality and realism, confirming the framework's robustness and versatility across various applications.

Abstract: In the realm of image generation, the quest for realism and customization has
never been more pressing. While existing methods like concept sliders have made
strides, they often falter when it comes to no-AIGC images, particularly images
captured in real world settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Beyond
Sliders, an innovative framework that integrates GANs and diffusion models to
facilitate sophisticated image manipulation across diverse image categories.
Improved upon concept sliders, our method refines the image through fine
grained guidance both textual and visual in an adversarial manner, leading to a
marked enhancement in image quality and realism. Extensive experimental
validation confirms the robustness and versatility of Beyond Sliders across a
spectrum of applications.

*Johann Schmidt,Sebastian Stober*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Probabilistic component-wise Spatial Transformer Networks improve fine-grained visual classification by decomposing affine transformations into rotation, scaling, and shearing components with geometric constraints and uncertainty modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained visual classification is highly sensitive to geometric variability (orientations, scales, perspective distortions). Existing equivariant architectures require substantial computational resources and restrict the hypothesis space.

Method: Revisits Spatial Transformer Networks as a canonicalization tool, proposing a probabilistic component-wise extension that decomposes affine transformations into rotation, scaling, and shearing components. Uses a shared localization encoder with geometric constraints, models each component with Gaussian variational posterior, and performs sampling-based canonicalization. Includes a novel component-wise alignment loss using augmentation parameters.

Result: Experiments on challenging moth classification benchmarks demonstrate that the method consistently improves robustness compared to other STN approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed probabilistic component-wise STN provides a flexible, backbone-agnostic solution for handling geometric variability in fine-grained visual classification, offering improved robustness without architectural constraints.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) remains highly sensitive to
geometric variability, where objects appear under arbitrary orientations,
scales, and perspective distortions. While equivariant architectures address
this issue, they typically require substantial computational resources and
restrict the hypothesis space. We revisit Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs)
as a canonicalization tool for transformer-based vision pipelines, emphasizing
their flexibility, backbone-agnostic nature, and lack of architectural
constraints. We propose a probabilistic, component-wise extension that improves
robustness. Specifically, we decompose affine transformations into rotation,
scaling, and shearing, and regress each component under geometric constraints
using a shared localization encoder. To capture uncertainty, we model each
component with a Gaussian variational posterior and perform sampling-based
canonicalization during inference.A novel component-wise alignment loss
leverages augmentation parameters to guide spatial alignment. Experiments on
challenging moth classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently improves robustness compared to other STNs.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel few-shot learning framework (CCoMAML with MHAFF) for cattle identification using muzzle patterns, achieving 98.46% F1 score without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RFID ear tags are unreliable due to loss, damage, and security vulnerabilities. Biometric identification using cattle muzzle patterns offers a robust alternative, but deep learning models face challenges with limited data and dynamic herd compositions.

Method: Uses Cooperative Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (CCoMAML) with Multi-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) as feature extractor for few-shot learning, enabling efficient adaptation to new data without retraining.

Result: Achieved superior performance with 98.46% and 97.91% F1 scores, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot learning techniques in cattle identification.

Conclusion: The proposed CCoMAML with MHAFF framework provides an effective solution for real-time cattle identification with high accuracy and adaptability to new data without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Cattle identification is critical for efficient livestock farming management,
currently reliant on radio-frequency identification (RFID) ear tags. However,
RFID-based systems are prone to failure due to loss, damage, tampering, and
vulnerability to external attacks. As a robust alternative, biometric
identification using cattle muzzle patterns similar to human fingerprints has
emerged as a promising solution. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated
success in leveraging these unique patterns for accurate identification. But
deep learning models face significant challenges, including limited data
availability, disruptions during data collection, and dynamic herd compositions
that require frequent model retraining. To address these limitations, this
paper proposes a novel few-shot learning framework for real-time cattle
identification using Cooperative Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (CCoMAML) with
Multi-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) as a feature extractor model. This
model offers great model adaptability to new data through efficient learning
from few data samples without retraining. The proposed approach has been
rigorously evaluated against current state-of-the-art few-shot learning
techniques applied in cattle identification. Comprehensive experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed CCoMAML with MHAFF has superior cattle
identification performance with 98.46% and 97.91% F1 scores.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANROT-HELANet is a robust few-shot learning network that uses Hellinger distance-based aggregation and a novel contrastive loss to achieve state-of-the-art performance while being resilient to adversarial attacks and natural noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Bayesian-based FSL methods using KL divergence are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and natural noises, creating a need for more robust approaches.

Method: Implements Hellinger distance-based feature class aggregation, attention mechanisms, and a novel Hellinger Similarity contrastive loss function for variational few-shot inference.

Result: Achieves 1.20% and 1.40% improvements for 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios on miniImageNet, robust to adversarial perturbations (ε=0.30) and Gaussian noise (σ=0.30), with superior FID score of 2.75 for image reconstruction.

Conclusion: ANROT-HELANet establishes new state-of-the-art performance in FSL while maintaining robustness against both adversarial and natural perturbations through its Hellinger-based approach.

Abstract: Few-Shot Learning (FSL), which involves learning to generalize using only a
few data samples, has demonstrated promising and superior performances to
ordinary CNN methods. While Bayesian based estimation approaches using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence have shown improvements, they remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks and natural noises. We introduce
ANROT-HELANet, an Adversarially and Naturally RObusT Hellinger Aggregation
Network that significantly advances the state-of-the-art in FSL robustness and
performance. Our approach implements an adversarially and naturally robust
Hellinger distance-based feature class aggregation scheme, demonstrating
resilience to adversarial perturbations up to $\epsilon=0.30$ and Gaussian
noise up to $\sigma=0.30$. The network achieves substantial improvements across
benchmark datasets, including gains of 1.20\% and 1.40\% for 1-shot and 5-shot
scenarios on miniImageNet respectively. We introduce a novel Hellinger
Similarity contrastive loss function that generalizes cosine similarity
contrastive loss for variational few-shot inference scenarios. Our approach
also achieves superior image reconstruction quality with a FID score of 2.75,
outperforming traditional VAE (3.43) and WAE (3.38) approaches. Extensive
experiments conducted on four few-shot benchmarked datasets verify that
ANROT-HELANet's combination of Hellinger distance-based feature aggregation,
attention mechanisms, and our novel loss function establishes new
state-of-the-art performance while maintaining robustness against both
adversarial and natural perturbations. Our code repository will be available at

TL;DR: MIS-LSTM is a hybrid CNN-LSTM framework with attention fusion and uncertainty-aware ensemble for sleep/stress prediction from multimodal lifelog data, achieving 0.647 Macro-F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust framework for predicting sleep quality and stress from multimodal lifelog data by effectively handling both continuous sensor streams and sparse discrete events while capturing long-range temporal dependencies.

Method: Uses CNN encoders for continuous data (rendered as multi-channel images) and 1D-CNN for discrete events, fused with Convolutional Block Attention Module, then aggregated by LSTM for temporal modeling, with UALRE uncertainty-aware ensemble for robustness.

Result: Achieves Macro-F1 score of 0.615 for base MIS-LSTM and improves to 0.647 with UALRE ensemble, outperforming LSTM, 1D-CNN, and CNN baselines. Ablations confirm benefits of multi-channel imaging, 4-hour blocks, and modality-specific encoding.

Conclusion: The proposed MIS-LSTM framework with UALRE ensemble effectively handles multimodal lifelog data for sleep and stress prediction, demonstrating superior performance through careful architectural design and uncertainty-aware voting.

Abstract: This paper presents MIS-LSTM, a hybrid framework that joins CNN encoders with
an LSTM sequence model for sleep quality and stress prediction at the day level
from multimodal lifelog data. Continuous sensor streams are first partitioned
into N-hour blocks and rendered as multi-channel images, while sparse discrete
events are encoded with a dedicated 1D-CNN. A Convolutional Block Attention
Module fuses the two modalities into refined block embeddings, which an LSTM
then aggregates to capture long-range temporal dependencies. To further boost
robustness, we introduce UALRE, an uncertainty-aware ensemble that overrides
lowconfidence majority votes with high-confidence individual predictions.
Experiments on the 2025 ETRI Lifelog Challenge dataset show that Our base
MISLSTM achieves Macro-F1 0.615; with the UALRE ensemble, the score improves to
0.647, outperforming strong LSTM, 1D-CNN, and CNN baselines. Ablations confirm
(i) the superiority of multi-channel over stacked-vertical imaging, (ii) the
benefit of a 4-hour block granularity, and (iii) the efficacy of

TL;DR: CMLReID is a CLIP-based framework that addresses both same-cloth and clothing-change person re-identification in continual learning settings, using adaptive prompts and knowledge fusion to handle clothing variations and prevent forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world surveillance systems need person re-identification models that can handle clothing changes while maintaining continual learning capabilities, but existing methods treat these as separate problems rather than addressing them together.

Method: CMLReID uses two novel components: Context-Aware Semantic Prompt (CASP) for generating adaptive prompts that align visual cues with semantic text space, and Adaptive Knowledge Fusion and Projection (AKFP) with dual-path learner and Clothing-State-Aware Projection Loss for robust prototypes.

Result: Experiments show CMLReID outperforms all state-of-the-art methods with strong robustness and generalization across various datasets, handling both clothing variations and sequential learning effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the hybrid continual learning problem for person re-identification with clothing changes, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Person Re-Identification (ReID) has several challenges in real-world
surveillance systems due to clothing changes (CCReID) and the need for
maintaining continual learning (LReID). Previous existing methods either
develop models specifically for one application, which is mostly a same-cloth
(SC) setting or treat CCReID as its own separate sub-problem. In this work, we
will introduce the LReID-Hybrid task with the goal of developing a model to
achieve both SC and CC while learning in a continual setting. Mismatched
representations and forgetting from one task to the next are significant
issues, we address this with CMLReID, a CLIP-based framework composed of two
novel tasks: (1) Context-Aware Semantic Prompt (CASP) that generates adaptive
prompts, and also incorporates context to align richly multi-grained visual
cues with semantic text space; and (2) Adaptive Knowledge Fusion and Projection
(AKFP) which produces robust SC/CC prototypes through the use of a dual-path
learner that aligns features with our Clothing-State-Aware Projection Loss.
Experiments performed on a wide range of datasets and illustrate that CMLReID
outperforms all state-of-the-art methods with strong robustness and
generalization despite clothing variations and a sophisticated process of
sequential learning.

### [52] [Cross-Domain Attribute Alignment with CLIP: A Rehearsal-Free Approach for Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11264)
*Kerun Mi,Guoliang Kang,Guangyu Li,Lin Zhao,Tao Zhou,Chen Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation that uses CLIP to extract domain-invariant class-agnostic attributes, represented as key-value pairs, to enable rehearsal-free cross-domain alignment and reduce catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CI-UDA methods require storing rehearsal samples and perform asymmetric alignment, leading to increasing memory usage and knowledge forgetting. The paper aims to address these limitations by mining domain-invariant knowledge.

Method: Extracts class-agnostic attributes using CLIP, represents them as key-value pairs (visual prototype + textual prompt), maintains domain-specific attribute dictionaries, and performs cross-domain alignment through visual attention consistency and prediction consistency.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on three CI-UDA benchmarks and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting without requiring rehearsal samples.

Conclusion: The proposed attribute-based approach successfully mitigates domain shift while reducing catastrophic knowledge forgetting in a rehearsal-free manner, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-UDA) aims to adapt a
model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the
sets of potential target classes appearing at different time steps are disjoint
and are subsets of the source classes. The key to solving this problem lies in
avoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes
during continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works
cumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store
and utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid
catastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between
classes shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will
continuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in
knowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve
domain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task.
Specifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we
name as "attribute". In our framework, we learn a "key-value" pair to represent
an attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value
is the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each
corresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across
domains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention
consistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and
cross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting
while mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on
three CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

TL;DR: A novel evaluation framework for synthetic datasets using cross-validation and transfer learning metrics to assess quality and transferability across real-world benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current synthetic dataset evaluation lacks standardized frameworks, making it difficult to compare quality and guide optimization of synthetic data generation methods.

Method: Proposes a framework with cross-validation experiments and domain transfer learning, using task-specific models trained on both synthetic and real datasets to create a Generalized Cross-Validation Matrix with two key metrics for simulation quality and transfer quality.

Result: Experimental validation on Virtual KITTI demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in assessing synthetic data fidelity, providing scalable and quantifiable evaluation.

Conclusion: The framework overcomes traditional limitations and offers a principled approach to guide synthetic dataset optimization in AI research.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of synthetic dataset generation techniques,
evaluating the quality of synthetic data has become a critical research focus.
Robust evaluation not only drives innovations in data generation methods but
also guides researchers in optimizing the utilization of these synthetic
resources. However, current evaluation studies for synthetic datasets remain
limited, lacking a universally accepted standard framework. To address this,
this paper proposes a novel evaluation framework integrating generalized
cross-validation experiments and domain transfer learning principles, enabling
generalizable and comparable assessments of synthetic dataset quality. The
framework involves training task-specific models (e.g., YOLOv5s) on both
synthetic datasets and multiple real-world benchmarks (e.g., KITTI, BDD100K),
forming a cross-performance matrix. Following normalization, a Generalized
Cross-Validation (GCV) Matrix is constructed to quantify domain
transferability. The framework introduces two key metrics. One measures the
simulation quality by quantifying the similarity between synthetic data and
real-world datasets, while another evaluates the transfer quality by assessing
the diversity and coverage of synthetic data across various real-world
scenarios. Experimental validation on Virtual KITTI demonstrates the
effectiveness of our proposed framework and metrics in assessing synthetic data
fidelity. This scalable and quantifiable evaluation solution overcomes
traditional limitations, providing a principled approach to guide synthetic
dataset optimization in artificial intelligence research.

*Lianjun Liao,Chunhui Zhang,Tong Wu,Henglei Lv,Bailin Deng,Lin Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROSGS is a two-stage pipeline that efficiently reconstructs relightable outdoor scenes using Gaussian Splatting representation, achieving superior relighting accuracy and rendering efficiency compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outdoor scenes present challenges for decomposition into geometry, reflectance, and illumination due to unbounded scenes and varying lighting conditions. Existing NeRF and 3DGS approaches suffer from high computational overhead and low-frequency lighting representations that lead to inefficient rendering and suboptimal relighting accuracy.

Method: ROSGS uses a two-stage approach: 1) Reconstructs scene geometry with compact 2D Gaussian Splatting using monocular normal priors, 2) Decomposes texture and lighting through a hybrid lighting model that combines spherical Gaussian functions for directional sunlight (high-frequency) and Spherical Harmonic coefficients for skylight (low-frequency).

Result: Both quantitative metrics and qualitative comparisons demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in relighting outdoor scenes, with superior relighting accuracy and rendering efficiency.

Conclusion: ROSGS effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods by providing an efficient and accurate solution for outdoor scene relighting using a hybrid lighting model and Gaussian Splatting representation.

Abstract: Image data captured outdoors often exhibit unbounded scenes and
unconstrained, varying lighting conditions, making it challenging to decompose
them into geometry, reflectance, and illumination. Recent works have focused on
achieving this decomposition using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or the 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation but remain hindered by two key
limitations: the high computational overhead associated with neural networks of
NeRF and the use of low-frequency lighting representations, which often result
in inefficient rendering and suboptimal relighting accuracy. We propose ROSGS,
a two-stage pipeline designed to efficiently reconstruct relightable outdoor
scenes using the Gaussian Splatting representation. By leveraging monocular
normal priors, ROSGS first reconstructs the scene's geometry with the compact
2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) representation, providing an efficient and
accurate geometric foundation. Building upon this reconstructed geometry, ROSGS
then decomposes the scene's texture and lighting through a hybrid lighting
model. This model effectively represents typical outdoor lighting by employing
a spherical Gaussian function to capture the directional, high-frequency
components of sunlight, while learning a radiance transfer function via
Spherical Harmonic coefficients to model the remaining low-frequency skylight
comprehensively. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative comparisons
demonstrate that ROSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in relighting
outdoor scenes and highlight its ability to deliver superior relighting
accuracy and rendering efficiency.

### [55] [Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by Self-Injecting Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11287)
*Yifan Lu,Ziqi Zhang,Chunfeng Yuan,Jun Gao,Congxuan Zhang,Xiaojuan Qi,Bing Li,Weiming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APASI is a novel method that autonomously mitigates hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by self-injecting realistic hallucinations to create preference data without external dependencies, achieving comparable performance to methods requiring human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination mitigation methods require external human annotations or auxiliary models for preference data collection, which increases costs and limits sustainable improvement. There's a need for a self-sufficient approach that can continuously improve LVLMs without external dependencies.

Method: APASI leverages the target LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into generated responses based on three key observations of hallucinations, creating preference pairs. It uses iterative alignment training with curriculum learning to periodically update preference data with increasing challenge levels.

Result: Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show APASI effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models and achieves comparable or superior performance to alignment-based methods with external dependencies.

Conclusion: APASI demonstrates an effective and generalizable approach for hallucination mitigation that eliminates the need for external human annotations or auxiliary models, enabling stable and continuous enhancement of LVLMs through autonomous preference alignment.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from serious hallucination
problems, where the model-generated responses are inconsistent with the visual
inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are mainly based on
preference alignment and require external human annotations or auxiliary models
for preference data collection, which increase costs and limit sustainable
improvement. To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference
Alignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that
mitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the
target LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a
pair of responses with varying preference levels. During the self-injection
process, the dis-preferred response is generated based on three key
observations of hallucinations, ensuring it simulates real hallucination
patterns. This fidelity offers an accurate learning signal for hallucination
mitigation. Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training
strategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the
preference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous
enhancement of the LVLM. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show that
APASI not only effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models
but also achieves comparable or even superior performance to alignment-based
methods with external dependency, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and
generalization capability. The code is available at

### [56] [Leveraging Geometric Priors for Unaligned Scene Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11292)
*Ziling Liu,Ziwei Chen,Mingqi Gao,Jinyu Yang,Feng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a training-free framework that leverages geometric priors from a Geometric Foundation Model to address unaligned scene change detection, overcoming limitations of appearance-based methods by enabling reliable overlap identification, robust correspondence, and explicit occlusion detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unaligned scene change detection methods rely solely on 2D visual cues, which fail under large viewpoint changes and lack explicit geometric reasoning. The limited supervision from small-scale datasets restricts learning generalizable multi-view knowledge.

Method: Proposes a training-free framework that integrates geometric priors from a Geometric Foundation Model with visual foundation model representations. This enables reliable identification of visual overlaps, robust correspondence establishment, and explicit occlusion detection without additional training.

Result: Extensive evaluation on PSCD, ChangeSim, and PASLCD datasets demonstrates superior and robust performance compared to existing methods, effectively handling viewpoint misalignment challenges.

Conclusion: The integration of geometric priors with visual foundation models provides a powerful solution for unaligned scene change detection, addressing core challenges of viewpoint variations, correspondence establishment, and occlusion handling without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Unaligned Scene Change Detection aims to detect scene changes between image
pairs captured at different times without assuming viewpoint alignment. To
handle viewpoint variations, current methods rely solely on 2D visual cues to
establish cross-image correspondence to assist change detection. However, large
viewpoint changes can alter visual observations, causing appearance-based
matching to drift or fail. Additionally, supervision limited to 2D change masks
from small-scale SCD datasets restricts the learning of generalizable
multi-view knowledge, making it difficult to reliably identify visual overlaps
and handle occlusions. This lack of explicit geometric reasoning represents a
critical yet overlooked limitation. In this work, we are the first to leverage
geometric priors from a Geometric Foundation Model to address the core
challenges of unaligned SCD, including reliable identification of visual
overlaps, robust correspondence establishment, and explicit occlusion
detection. Building on these priors, we propose a training-free framework that
integrates them with the powerful representations of a visual foundation model
to enable reliable change detection under viewpoint misalignment. Through
extensive evaluation on the PSCD, ChangeSim, and PASLCD datasets, we
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior and robust performance. Our
code will be released at https://github.com/ZilingLiu/GeoSCD.

*Matthias Wüest,Francis Engelmann,Ondrej Miksik,Marc Pollefeys,Daniel Barath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnLoc is an efficient data-driven method for camera localization using floorplans that incorporates uncertainty modeling and leverages pre-trained depth models, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floorplan data is readily available and robust to visual changes, but existing methods lack uncertainty modeling in depth predictions and require custom depth networks trained for each specific environment, limiting generalization.

Method: Proposes a novel probabilistic model that treats depth predictions as explicit probability distributions, incorporating uncertainty estimation. Uses off-the-shelf pre-trained monocular depth models instead of per-environment-trained networks to enhance generalization.

Result: Achieves 2.7x higher localization recall on long sequences (100 frames) and 16.7x higher on short sequences (15 frames) than state-of-the-art methods on the challenging LaMAR HGE dataset. Demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy and robustness on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: UnLoc provides an efficient and generalizable solution for sequential camera localization that overcomes key limitations of previous approaches through probabilistic uncertainty modeling and the use of pre-trained depth models, enabling better performance across diverse environments.

Abstract: We propose UnLoc, an efficient data-driven solution for sequential camera
localization within floorplans. Floorplan data is readily available, long-term
persistent, and robust to changes in visual appearance. We address key
limitations of recent methods, such as the lack of uncertainty modeling in
depth predictions and the necessity for custom depth networks trained for each
environment. We introduce a novel probabilistic model that incorporates
uncertainty estimation, modeling depth predictions as explicit probability
distributions. By leveraging off-the-shelf pre-trained monocular depth models,
we eliminate the need to rely on per-environment-trained depth networks,
enhancing generalization to unseen spaces. We evaluate UnLoc on large-scale
synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over
existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Notably, we achieve $2.7$
times higher localization recall on long sequences (100 frames) and $16.7$
times higher on short ones (15 frames) than the state of the art on the
challenging LaMAR HGE dataset.

### [58] [Motion Estimation for Multi-Object Tracking using KalmanNet with Semantic-Independent Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11323)
*Jian Song,Wei Mei,Yunfeng Xu,Qiang Fu,Renke Kou,Lina Bu,Yucheng Long*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIKNet is a novel learning-aided Kalman filter that uses semantic-independent encoding to improve motion estimation in multi-object tracking, outperforming traditional methods and achieving better robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Kalman filters based on linear constant-velocity models perform poorly when parameters are mismatched and objects move non-stationarily, requiring a more robust motion estimation approach for multi-object tracking.

Method: Proposes Semantic-Independent KalmanNet (SIKNet) with a Semantic-Independent Encoder that uses 1D convolution along homogeneous-semantic elements and fully-connected layers with nonlinear activation for heterogeneous-semantic elements.

Result: SIKNet outperforms traditional Kalman filters and existing learning-aided filters, demonstrating superior robustness and accuracy on a large-scale semi-simulated dataset constructed from open-source MOT datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed SIKNet effectively handles motion estimation challenges in MOT by combining semantic-independent encoding with learning techniques, providing a more robust and accurate solution than traditional approaches.

Abstract: Motion estimation is a crucial component in multi-object tracking (MOT).
  It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their
positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and
identity switches.
  The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of
the most commonly used methods in MOT.
  However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are
mismatched and objects move in non-stationary.
  In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion
estimation of MOT.
  In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet
(SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a
Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps.
  First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves
along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state
vectors to encode independent semantic information.
  Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to
encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between
heterogeneous-semantic elements.
  To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in
MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several
open-source MOT datasets.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the
traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing
learning-aided filters.

### [59] [Toward Next-generation Medical Vision Backbones: Modeling Finer-grained Long-range Visual Dependency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11328)
*Mingyuan Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This doctoral research investigates long-range visual dependency modeling in medical image computing, comparing transformers and MLPs. It finds MLPs are superior for capturing fine-grained dependencies in high-resolution medical images, outperforming transformers and CNNs across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis requires models that capture both global context and local subtle details. While transformers excel at long-range modeling, they struggle with high-resolution features due to computational constraints. MLPs offer a promising but under-explored alternative for efficient long-range dependency modeling in medical images.

Method: The research first explores transformers for pixel-wise and image-wise medical vision tasks, then pioneers MLP-based visual models to capture fine-grained long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments compare these approaches across various medical vision tasks.

Result: Experiments confirm the critical importance of long-range dependency modeling in MIC. MLPs demonstrate feasibility in modeling finer-grained long-range dependencies among higher-resolution medical features containing enriched anatomical/pathological details, consistently outperforming transformers and CNNs.

Conclusion: MLPs establish themselves as a superior paradigm over transformers and CNNs for medical image computing, providing enhanced performance across various vision tasks and paving the way for next-generation medical vision backbones through their ability to handle high-resolution features efficiently.

Abstract: Medical Image Computing (MIC) is a broad research topic covering both
pixel-wise (e.g., segmentation, registration) and image-wise (e.g.,
classification, regression) vision tasks. Effective analysis demands models
that capture both global long-range context and local subtle visual
characteristics, necessitating fine-grained long-range visual dependency
modeling. Compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are limited by
intrinsic locality, transformers excel at long-range modeling; however, due to
the high computational loads of self-attention, transformers typically cannot
process high-resolution features (e.g., full-scale image features before
downsampling or patch embedding) and thus face difficulties in modeling
fine-grained dependency among subtle medical image details. Concurrently,
Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based visual models are recognized as
computation/memory-efficient alternatives in modeling long-range visual
dependency but have yet to be widely investigated in the MIC community. This
doctoral research advances deep learning-based MIC by investigating effective
long-range visual dependency modeling. It first presents innovative use of
transformers for both pixel- and image-wise medical vision tasks. The focus
then shifts to MLPs, pioneeringly developing MLP-based visual models to capture
fine-grained long-range visual dependency in medical images. Extensive
experiments confirm the critical role of long-range dependency modeling in MIC
and reveal a key finding: MLPs provide feasibility in modeling finer-grained
long-range dependency among higher-resolution medical features containing
enriched anatomical/pathological details. This finding establishes MLPs as a
superior paradigm over transformers/CNNs, consistently enhancing performance
across various medical vision tasks and paving the way for next-generation
medical vision backbones.

*Sriram Narayanan,Mani Ramanagopal,Srinivasa G. Narasimhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First method to separate reflected and emitted light components in thermal videos using dual-band thermal cameras with different spectral sensitivities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In near-ambient conditions relevant to computer vision, both reflected environmental light and emitted surface light are comparable and vary over time, making separation essential for understanding object properties like emissivity, temperature, reflectance and shape.

Method: Derived dual-band thermal image formation model and developed algorithms to estimate surface emissivity and time-varying temperature while isolating dynamic background, using two thermal cameras with different spectral sensitivities.

Result: Quantitatively evaluated using carefully calibrated emissivities for various materials and showed qualitative results on complex everyday scenes like glass with hot liquid and people moving in background.

Conclusion: The approach successfully separates reflected and emitted light components in thermal imaging, enabling accurate estimation of material properties and temperature variations in dynamic near-ambient conditions.

Abstract: Long-wave infrared radiation captured by a thermal camera consists of two
components: (a) light from the environment reflected or transmitted by a
surface, and (b) light emitted by the surface after undergoing heat transport
through the object and exchanging heat with the surrounding environment.
Separating these components is essential for understanding object properties
such as emissivity, temperature, reflectance and shape. Previous thermography
studies often assume that only one component is dominant (e.g., in welding) or
that the second component is constant and can be subtracted. However, in
near-ambient conditions, which are most relevant to computer vision
applications, both components are typically comparable in magnitude and vary
over time. We introduce the first method that separates reflected and emitted
components of light in videos captured by two thermal cameras with different
spectral sensitivities. We derive a dual-band thermal image formation model and
develop algorithms to estimate the surface's emissivity and its time-varying
temperature while isolating a dynamic background. We quantitatively evaluate
our approach using carefully calibrated emissivities for a range of materials
and show qualitative results on complex everyday scenes, such as a glass filled
with hot liquid and people moving in the background.

*Huaiyuan Qin,Muli Yang,Siyuan Hu,Peng Hu,Yu Zhang,Chen Gong,Hongyuan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSL can learn meaningful representations even without strict instance consistency, with moderate view diversity enhancing performance while excessive diversity reduces effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SSL assumes instance consistency where different views of the same image are positive pairs, but this breaks down for non-iconic data where views may contain different objects or semantic information.

Method: Extensive ablation studies investigating SSL effectiveness when instance consistency is not guaranteed, using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to measure mutual information between views and quantify view diversity.

Result: SSL still learns meaningful representations without strict instance consistency. Moderate view diversity (zero overlapping or smaller crop scales) enhances downstream performance on classification and dense prediction tasks, but excessive diversity reduces effectiveness.

Conclusion: There is an optimal range for view diversity in SSL frameworks, with moderate EMD values correlating with improved learning, providing insights for future SSL design that works across diverse data sources.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) conventionally relies on the instance
consistency paradigm, assuming that different views of the same image can be
treated as positive pairs. However, this assumption breaks down for non-iconic
data, where different views may contain distinct objects or semantic
information. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of SSL when
instance consistency is not guaranteed. Through extensive ablation studies, we
demonstrate that SSL can still learn meaningful representations even when
positive pairs lack strict instance consistency. Furthermore, our analysis
further reveals that increasing view diversity, by enforcing zero overlapping
or using smaller crop scales, can enhance downstream performance on
classification and dense prediction tasks. However, excessive diversity is
found to reduce effectiveness, suggesting an optimal range for view diversity.
To quantify this, we adopt the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) as an estimator to
measure mutual information between views, finding that moderate EMD values
correlate with improved SSL learning, providing insights for future SSL
framework design. We validate our findings across a range of settings,
highlighting their robustness and applicability on diverse data sources.

*Robin Narsingh Ranabhat,Longwei Wang,Amit Kumar Patel,KC santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two regularization methods to make CNNs more shape-biased and robust to image corruptions by reducing texture reliance and enhancing shape-based representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs are vulnerable to common image corruptions due to their over-reliance on local texture cues rather than global object shapes, unlike human perception which handles such corruptions better.

Method: 1) Auxiliary loss enforcing feature consistency between original and low-frequency filtered inputs to reduce high-frequency texture dependence. 2) Supervised contrastive learning to structure feature space around class-consistent, shape-relevant representations.

Result: Both methods improved corruption robustness on CIFAR-10-C benchmark without degrading clean accuracy.

Conclusion: Loss-level regularization can effectively steer CNNs toward more shape-aware and resilient representations, making them more robust to common corruptions.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at image classification but remain
vulnerable to common corruptions that humans handle with ease. A key reason for
this fragility is their reliance on local texture cues rather than global
object shapes -- a stark contrast to human perception. To address this, we
propose two complementary regularization strategies designed to encourage
shape-biased representations and enhance robustness. The first introduces an
auxiliary loss that enforces feature consistency between original and
low-frequency filtered inputs, discouraging dependence on high-frequency
textures. The second incorporates supervised contrastive learning to structure
the feature space around class-consistent, shape-relevant representations.
Evaluated on the CIFAR-10-C benchmark, both methods improve corruption
robustness without degrading clean accuracy. Our results suggest that
loss-level regularization can effectively steer CNNs toward more shape-aware,
resilient representations.

*Wan Xu,Feng Zhu,Yihan Zeng,Yuanfan Guo,Ming Liu,Hang Xu,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLaVE-Cap is a new video captioning framework that addresses limitations in current local-to-global approaches by introducing TrackFusion for comprehensive local caption generation and CaptionBridge for better local-global interaction, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current local-to-global video captioning paradigms produce less detailed and contextually inconsistent captions due to lack of fine-grained captioning mechanisms and weak interaction between local and global captions.

Method: Proposes GLaVE-Cap with two core modules: TrackFusion (uses vision experts for cross-frame visual prompts with dual-stream structure) and CaptionBridge (establishes local-global interaction using global context to guide local captioning and adaptive summarization). Also creates GLaVE-Bench benchmark and GLaVE-1.2M training dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks. Ablation studies validate effectiveness of proposed modules, and GLaVE-1.2M dataset contributes significantly to video understanding community.

Conclusion: GLaVE-Cap successfully addresses the limitations of current video captioning approaches through improved local caption generation and enhanced local-global interaction, providing comprehensive video descriptions with better detail and consistency.

Abstract: Video detailed captioning aims to generate comprehensive video descriptions
to facilitate video understanding. Recently, most efforts in the video detailed
captioning community have been made towards a local-to-global paradigm, which
first generates local captions from video clips and then summarizes them into a
global caption. However, we find this paradigm leads to less detailed and
contextual-inconsistent captions, which can be attributed to (1) no mechanism
to ensure fine-grained captions, and (2) weak interaction between local and
global captions. To remedy the above two issues, we propose GLaVE-Cap, a
Global-Local aligned framework with Vision Expert integration for Captioning,
which consists of two core modules: TrackFusion enables comprehensive local
caption generation, by leveraging vision experts to acquire cross-frame visual
prompts, coupled with a dual-stream structure; while CaptionBridge establishes
a local-global interaction, by using global context to guide local captioning,
and adaptively summarizing local captions into a coherent global caption.
Besides, we construct GLaVE-Bench, a comprehensive video captioning benchmark
featuring 5X more queries per video than existing benchmarks, covering diverse
visual dimensions to facilitate reliable evaluation. We further provide a
training dataset GLaVE-1.2M containing 16K high-quality fine-grained video
captions and 1.2M related question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments on four
benchmarks show that our GLaVE-Cap achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Besides, the ablation studies and student model analyses further validate the
effectiveness of the proposed modules and the contribution of GLaVE-1.2M to the
video understanding community. The source code, model weights, benchmark, and
dataset will be open-sourced.

Conclusion: Provides a validated tool for clinical and cosmetic skin analysis with applications in diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and skincare efficacy evaluation.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3-D) skin surface reconstruction offers promise for
objective and quantitative dermatological assessment, but no portable,
high-resolution device exists that has been validated and used for depth

TL;DR: MixANT introduces a mixture of experts approach to dynamically select context-dependent forget-gate matrices in State Space Models, enabling better long-term human activity anticipation while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current State Space Models like Mamba have static forget-gate matrices that control temporal memory, limiting their ability to adapt to different contextual inputs for human activity prediction.

Method: Proposes a mixture of experts architecture that dynamically selects appropriate A matrices (forget-gates) based on input features, enhancing representational capacity without computational overhead.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently across 50Salads, Breakfast, and Assembly101 datasets in all evaluation settings.

Conclusion: Input-dependent forget-gate mechanisms are crucial for reliable human behavior prediction in diverse real-world scenarios, and MixANT successfully addresses this need.

Abstract: We present MixANT, a novel architecture for stochastic long-term dense
anticipation of human activities. While recent State Space Models (SSMs) like
Mamba have shown promise through input-dependent selectivity on three key
parameters, the critical forget-gate ($\textbf{A}$ matrix) controlling temporal
memory remains static. We address this limitation by introducing a mixture of
experts approach that dynamically selects contextually relevant $\textbf{A}$
matrices based on input features, enhancing representational capacity without
sacrificing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the 50Salads,
Breakfast, and Assembly101 datasets demonstrate that MixANT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation settings. Our
results highlight the importance of input-dependent forget-gate mechanisms for
reliable prediction of human behavior in diverse real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hypernetwork-based method that dynamically generates classification models conditioned on available medical imaging modalities, enabling robust training and inference with incomplete multi-modal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world clinical environments often have partially incomplete multi-modal medical imaging data, and standard approaches (discarding samples, imputation, or dropout) limit robustness and generalizability.

Method: A hypernetwork learns to predict parameters of task-specific classification models based on available modalities, allowing training and inference on all samples regardless of completeness.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with up to 8% absolute accuracy increase when trained on datasets with 25% completeness (75% missing modalities).

Conclusion: Provides an efficient solution for real-world multi-modal medical data analysis by enabling a single model to generalize across all modality configurations.

Abstract: In real world clinical environments, training and applying deep learning
models on multi-modal medical imaging data often struggles with partially
incomplete data. Standard approaches either discard missing samples, require
imputation or repurpose dropout learning schemes, limiting robustness and
generalizability. To address this, we propose a hypernetwork-based method that
dynamically generates task-specific classification models conditioned on the
set of available modalities. Instead of training a fixed model, a hypernetwork
learns to predict the parameters of a task model adapted to available
modalities, enabling training and inference on all samples, regardless of
completeness. We compare this approach with (1) models trained only on complete
data, (2) state of the art channel dropout methods, and (3) an imputation-based
method, using artificially incomplete datasets to systematically analyze
robustness to missing modalities. Results demonstrate superior adaptability of
our method, outperforming state of the art approaches with an absolute increase
in accuracy of up to 8% when trained on a dataset with 25% completeness (75% of
training data with missing modalities). By enabling a single model to
generalize across all modality configurations, our approach provides an
efficient solution for real-world multi-modal medical data analysis.

TL;DR: A new method for animating Gaussian-based human avatars using weighted rotation blending with quaternion averaging to address artifacts from linear blend skinning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Gaussian splatting methods for human avatars suffer from artifacts when using linear blend skinning for deformation due to non-linear rotation properties of Gaussians.

Method: Proposes a weighted rotation blending approach using quaternion averaging to properly handle Gaussian rotations during animation, requiring only modification of linear blend skinning technique.

Result: Simpler vertex-based Gaussians that can be efficiently animated and integrated into any engine using standard Gaussian rasterizers.

Conclusion: The quaternion-based rotation blending approach provides a more effective solution for animating Gaussian-based human avatars compared to existing mesh-based or corrective offset methods.

Abstract: Radiance field-based methods have recently been used to reconstruct human
avatars, showing that we can significantly downscale the systems needed for
creating animated human avatars. Although this progress has been initiated by
neural radiance fields, their slow rendering and backward mapping from the
observation space to the canonical space have been the main challenges. With
Gaussian splatting overcoming both challenges, a new family of approaches has
emerged that are faster to train and render, while also straightforward to
implement using forward skinning from the canonical to the observation space.
However, the linear blend skinning required for the deformation of the
Gaussians does not provide valid results for their non-linear rotation
properties. To address such artifacts, recent works use mesh properties to
rotate the non-linear Gaussian properties or train models to predict corrective
offsets. Instead, we propose a weighted rotation blending approach that
leverages quaternion averaging. This leads to simpler vertex-based Gaussians
that can be efficiently animated and integrated in any engine by only modifying
the linear blend skinning technique, and using any Gaussian rasterizer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for disentangling biological and technical factors in medical imaging data using latent space rotation, improving cluster consistency and enabling better biomarker discovery in multi-center studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging data suffers from domain shifts due to different vendors and acquisition parameters, which hinders the discovery of biologically meaningful patterns and stable tissue-type clusters across different imaging settings.

Method: The approach actively learns domain shift via post-hoc rotation of the data latent space to disentangle biological and technical factors, creating a representation that separates tissue characteristics from acquisition artifacts.

Result: The method improved cluster consistency by +19.01% (ARI), +16.85% (NMI), and +12.39% (Dice) compared to entangled representations, outperforming four state-of-the-art harmonization methods. It also enhanced Cox survival prediction when quantifying tissue composition in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients.

Conclusion: The proposed label-free framework successfully facilitates biomarker discovery in multi-center routine imaging data by effectively disentangling biological and technical factors through latent space rotation.

Abstract: Identifying new disease-related patterns in medical imaging data with the
help of machine learning enlarges the vocabulary of recognizable findings. This
supports diagnostic and prognostic assessment. However, image appearance varies
not only due to biological differences, but also due to imaging technology
linked to vendors, scanning- or re- construction parameters. The resulting
domain shifts impedes data representation learning strategies and the discovery
of biologically meaningful cluster appearances. To address these challenges, we
introduce an approach to actively learn the domain shift via post-hoc rotation
of the data latent space, enabling disentanglement of biological and technical
factors. Results on real-world heterogeneous clinical data showcase that the
learned disentangled representation leads to stable clusters representing
tissue-types across different acquisition settings. Cluster consistency is
improved by +19.01% (ARI), +16.85% (NMI), and +12.39% (Dice) compared to the
entangled representation, outperforming four state-of-the-art harmonization
methods. When using the clusters to quantify tissue composition on idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis patients, the learned profiles enhance Cox survival
prediction. This indicates that the proposed label-free framework facilitates
biomarker discovery in multi-center routine imaging data. Code is available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A masked autoencoder approach for handling missing MRI sequences in 3D medical imaging, using multi-modal multi-task learning with late-fusion transformers to reconstruct missing data and improve downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing input sequences are common in medical imaging data, posing challenges for deep learning models that require complete input data for effective performance.

Method: Developed a masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm treating each MRI sequence as separate modality, using late-fusion transformer encoder and individual decoder streams for multi-task reconstruction, enabling cross-sequence reasoning for missing inputs.

Result: Achieved absolute improvement of 10.1 overall Dice score and 0.46 MCC over MAE-ViT baselines in downstream segmentation and classification tasks with missing input sequences.

Conclusion: The method provides a flexible and generalizable encoder for brain MRIs that can infer missing sequences and adapt to various downstream applications, demonstrating strong performance and robustness.

Abstract: Missing input sequences are common in medical imaging data, posing a
challenge for deep learning models reliant on complete input data. In this
work, inspired by MultiMAE [2], we develop a masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm
for multi-modal, multi-task learning in 3D medical imaging with brain MRIs. Our
method treats each MRI sequence as a separate input modality, leveraging a
late-fusion-style transformer encoder to integrate multi-sequence information
(multi-modal) and individual decoder streams for each modality for multi-task
reconstruction. This pretraining strategy guides the model to learn rich
representations per modality while also equipping it to handle missing inputs
through cross-sequence reasoning. The result is a flexible and generalizable
encoder for brain MRIs that infers missing sequences from available inputs and
can be adapted to various downstream applications. We demonstrate the
performance and robustness of our method against an MAE-ViT baseline in
downstream segmentation and classification tasks, showing absolute improvement
of $10.1$ overall Dice score and $0.46$ MCC over the baselines with missing
input sequences. Our experiments demonstrate the strength of this pretraining
strategy. The implementation is made available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrajTrack is a lightweight LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking framework that combines explicit motion proposals with implicit trajectory learning from historical bounding boxes, achieving state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D SOT methods face a dilemma: two-frame methods lack temporal context and perform poorly in sparse/occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods are robust but computationally expensive.

Method: Proposes a trajectory-based paradigm that enhances a base two-frame tracker by learning motion continuity from historical bounding box trajectories without additional point cloud inputs. Uses explicit motion proposal followed by implicit motion modeling to predict and refine future trajectories.

Result: Achieves 4.48% improvement in tracking precision over strong baseline on NuScenes benchmark while running at 56 FPS. Demonstrates strong generalizability across different base trackers.

Conclusion: TrajTrack resolves the efficiency-robustness trade-off in 3D SOT by leveraging trajectory-based learning, providing both high performance and computational efficiency without requiring additional point cloud data.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics
and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion
estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are
efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse
or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point
clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this
dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation,
TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame
tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box
trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It
first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit
motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines
and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale
NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong
baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong
generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers. Video is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FusionNet is an end-to-end framework for infrared and visible image fusion that uses modality-aware attention and pixel-wise alpha blending to dynamically integrate complementary features while preserving semantic information in critical regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to combine complementary structural and textural information from different spectral domains, but existing methods lack explicit modeling of inter-modality interaction and semantic preservation in task-critical regions.

Method: Proposes FusionNet with modality-aware attention mechanism to dynamically adjust feature contributions, pixel-wise alpha blending for adaptive content-aware fusion, and target-aware loss using weak ROI supervision to maintain semantic consistency.

Result: Experiments on M3FD dataset show FusionNet generates fused images with enhanced semantic preservation, high perceptual quality, and clear interpretability, benefiting downstream tasks like object detection.

Conclusion: FusionNet provides a general and extensible solution for semantic-aware multi-modal image fusion that effectively integrates complementary information while preserving important semantic content in critical regions.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is a fundamental task in multi-modal
perception that aims to integrate complementary structural and textural cues
from different spectral domains. In this paper, we propose FusionNet, a novel
end-to-end fusion framework that explicitly models inter-modality interaction
and enhances task-critical regions. FusionNet introduces a modality-aware
attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contribution of infrared and
visible features based on their discriminative capacity. To achieve
fine-grained, interpretable fusion, we further incorporate a pixel-wise alpha
blending module, which learns spatially-varying fusion weights in an adaptive
and content-aware manner. Moreover, we formulate a target-aware loss that
leverages weak ROI supervision to preserve semantic consistency in regions
containing important objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). Experiments on the
public M3FD dataset demonstrate that FusionNet generates fused images with
enhanced semantic preservation, high perceptual quality, and clear
interpretability. Our framework provides a general and extensible solution for
semantic-aware multi-modal image fusion, with benefits for downstream tasks
such as object detection and scene understanding.

*Wenhao Tang,Sheng Huang,Heng Fang,Fengtao Zhou,Bo Liu,Qingshan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Multiple Instance Learning framework with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL) that addresses bias towards easy instances in computational pathology by explicitly mining hard examples using a Siamese structure and momentum teacher.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods in computational pathology focus on identifying salient instances via attention mechanisms, leading to bias towards easy-to-classify instances while neglecting challenging ones. Hard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries.

Method: MHIM-MIL uses a Siamese structure with consistency constraint and class-aware instance probability. It employs a momentum teacher to mask salient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student model. Uses large-scale random masking for diverse hard instances and global recycle network to prevent key feature loss. Teacher updates via exponential moving average.

Result: Outperforms latest methods in both performance and efficiency on cancer diagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks across 12 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed MHIM-MIL framework effectively addresses the bias problem in MIL by mining hard instances, demonstrating superior performance across multiple computational pathology tasks.

Abstract: Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has
opened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue
comprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance
Learning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via
attention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify
instances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that
hard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries.
Applying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework
with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure
with a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a
class-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask
salient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student
model. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale
random masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of
losing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an
exponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent
training iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer
diagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate
that MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and
efficiency. The code is available at: https://github.com/DearCaat/MHIM-MIL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camouflaged object detection methods overlook semantic differences in textual prompts and fine-grained frequency features, limiting their ability to accurately segment objects that blend into surroundings.

Method: Proposes SFGNet with Multi-Band Fourier Module (MBFM) for handling complex backgrounds and blurred boundaries, and Interactive Structure Enhancement Block (ISEB) for maintaining structural integrity and boundary details.

Result: Extensive experiments on three COD benchmark datasets show the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The integration of semantic prompts and frequency-domain features with specialized modules effectively improves camouflaged object detection and boundary perception.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to segment objects that blend into
their surroundings. However, most existing studies overlook the semantic
differences among textual prompts of different targets as well as fine-grained
frequency features. In this work, we propose a novel Semantic and Frequency
Guided Network (SFGNet), which incorporates semantic prompts and
frequency-domain features to capture camouflaged objects and improve boundary
perception. We further design Multi-Band Fourier Module(MBFM) to enhance the
ability of the network in handling complex backgrounds and blurred boundaries.
In addition, we design an Interactive Structure Enhancement Block (ISEB) to
ensure structural integrity and boundary details in the predictions. Extensive
experiments conducted on three COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The core code of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot auxiliary reasoning methods (axes, grids, labeled intersections) improve GUI grounding performance in VLMs without fine-tuning, bridging the gap between latent spatial understanding and explicit coordinate output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General vision-language models struggle with GUI grounding despite having latent spatial understanding capabilities, and current fine-tuning approaches require high data/annotation costs.

Method: Three zero-shot auxiliary reasoning methods that provide explicit spatial cues (axes, grids, labeled intersections) as part of input images to help VLMs articulate their implicit spatial understanding.

Result: Substantial performance improvement on four GUI grounding benchmarks across seven open-source and proprietary VLMs, demonstrating effective bridging of the gap between latent potential and explicit coordinate output.

Conclusion: Simple zero-shot spatial cue methods can effectively unlock VLMs' latent GUI grounding capabilities without expensive fine-tuning, making GUI agent development more accessible.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding is a fundamental task for building
GUI agents. However, general vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with this
task due to a lack of specific optimization. We identify a key gap in this
paper: while VLMs exhibit significant latent grounding potential, as
demonstrated by their performance measured by Pointing Game, they underperform
when tasked with outputting explicit coordinates. To address this discrepancy,
and bypass the high data and annotation costs of current fine-tuning
approaches, we propose three zero-shot auxiliary reasoning methods. By
providing explicit spatial cues such as axes, grids and labeled intersections
as part of the input image, these methods enable VLMs to articulate their
implicit spatial understanding capabilities. We evaluate these methods on four
GUI grounding benchmarks across seven open-source and proprietary VLMs. The
evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed methods substantially improve
the performance of GUI grounding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPS-SLAM is a real-time 3D reconstruction system that combines Gaussian and SDF representations to achieve 150+ fps while maintaining quality, addressing computational bottlenecks in Gaussian-based SLAM methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Gaussian-based SLAM methods operate at less than 20 fps due to heavy computational burden from numerous Gaussians and complex optimization, significantly lagging behind geometry-centric approaches that achieve hundreds of fps.

Method: Proposes a Gaussian-SDF hybrid representation: uses colorized Signed Distance Field (SDF) for smooth geometry/appearance via efficient RGB-D fusion, and 3D Gaussians for detail capture. Enables 50% fewer Gaussians and 75% fewer optimization iterations through targeted refinement.

Result: Achieves over 150 fps on real-world Azure Kinect sequences - an order-of-magnitude speedup over state-of-the-art techniques while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The hybrid representation successfully addresses computational bottlenecks in Gaussian-based SLAM, enabling real-time performance without sacrificing reconstruction quality, with plans to release source code and data for future research.

Abstract: While recent Gaussian-based SLAM methods achieve photorealistic
reconstruction from RGB-D data, their computational performance remains a
critical bottleneck. State-of-the-art techniques operate at less than 20 fps,
significantly lagging behind geometry-centric approaches like KinectFusion
(hundreds of fps). This limitation stems from the heavy computational burden:
modeling scenes requires numerous Gaussians and complex iterative optimization
to fit RGB-D data, where insufficient Gaussian counts or optimization
iterations cause severe quality degradation. To address this, we propose a
Gaussian-SDF hybrid representation, combining a colorized Signed Distance Field
(SDF) for smooth geometry and appearance with 3D Gaussians to capture
underrepresented details. The SDF is efficiently constructed via RGB-D fusion
(as in geometry-centric methods), while Gaussians undergo iterative
optimization. Our representation enables drastic Gaussian reduction (50% fewer)
by avoiding full-scene Gaussian modeling, and efficient Gaussian optimization
(75% fewer iterations) through targeted appearance refinement. Building upon
this representation, we develop GPS-SLAM (Gaussian-Plus-SDF SLAM), a real-time
3D reconstruction system achieving over 150 fps on real-world Azure Kinect
sequences -- delivering an order-of-magnitude speedup over state-of-the-art
techniques while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality. We will release
the source code and data to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Hierarchical Identity Learning (HIL) framework with Multi-Center Contrastive Learning and Bidirectional Reverse Selection Transmission to address fine-grained variations in unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cluster-based methods for unsupervised visible-infrared ReID focus only on commonality within clusters but neglect finer-grained differences among images, limiting performance.

Method: HIL framework with secondary clustering to generate multiple memories per cluster, MCCL for representation refinement, and BRST mechanism for reliable cross-modal matching through bidirectional pseudo-label matching.

Result: Extensive experiments on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets show the method outperforms existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical approach effectively captures fine-grained variations and improves cross-modal matching in unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification.

Abstract: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USVI-ReID) aims to
learn modality-invariant image features from unlabeled cross-modal person
datasets by reducing the modality gap while minimizing reliance on costly
manual annotations. Existing methods typically address USVI-ReID using
cluster-based contrastive learning, which represents a person by a single
cluster center. However, they primarily focus on the commonality of images
within each cluster while neglecting the finer-grained differences among them.
To address the limitation, we propose a Hierarchical Identity Learning (HIL)
framework. Since each cluster may contain several smaller sub-clusters that
reflect fine-grained variations among images, we generate multiple memories for
each existing coarse-grained cluster via a secondary clustering. Additionally,
we propose Multi-Center Contrastive Learning (MCCL) to refine representations
for enhancing intra-modal clustering and minimizing cross-modal discrepancies.
To further improve cross-modal matching quality, we design a Bidirectional
Reverse Selection Transmission (BRST) mechanism, which establishes reliable
cross-modal correspondences by performing bidirectional matching of
pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments conducted on the SYSU-MM01 and RegDB
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches.

Result: Validated with EfficientNet, ResNet and ConvNeXt on CIFAR-10 and iNaturalist21 datasets, showing improved and balanced model performance through optimized data distribution.

Conclusion: BiCDO provides an effective approach for bias-controlled class distribution optimization that enhances model reliability and enables targeted performance improvements for critical classes.

Abstract: We propose BiCDO (Bias-Controlled Class Distribution Optimizer), an
iterative, data-centric framework that identifies Pareto optimized class
distributions for multi-class image classification. BiCDO enables performance
prioritization for specific classes, which is useful in safety-critical
scenarios (e.g. prioritizing 'Human' over 'Dog'). Unlike uniform distributions,
BiCDO determines the optimal number of images per class to enhance reliability
and minimize bias and variance in the objective function. BiCDO can be
incorporated into existing training pipelines with minimal code changes and
supports any labelled multi-class dataset. We have validated BiCDO using

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VQA methods produce single numerical scores that lack comprehensiveness and interpretability, which is insufficient for selecting high-quality videos from large-scale datasets used in pre-training modern video generation models.

Method: Created MVQA-68K dataset with over 68,000 videos annotated across seven quality dimensions (aesthetics, camera movement, dynamic degree, texture detail, composition, visual quality, factual consistency) with chain-of-thought reasoning. Used this dataset to train multimodal large language models for VQA tasks.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on internal test set and public benchmarks (LSVQ-test, LSVQ-1080p, LIVE-VQC). Incorporating explicit reasoning process during training substantially boosted zero-shot generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: MVQA-68K provides a comprehensive and interpretable framework for video quality assessment that significantly enhances model performance and generalization, addressing limitations of traditional single-score VQA methods.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Sora, video
quality assessment (VQA) is becoming increasingly crucial for selecting
high-quality videos from large-scale datasets used in pre-training. Traditional
VQA methods, typically producing single numerical scores, often lack
comprehensiveness and interpretability. To address these challenges, we
introduce MVQA-68K, a novel multi-dimensional VQA dataset comprising over
68,000 carefully annotated videos, covering seven essential quality dimensions:
overall aesthetics, camera movement, dynamic degree, texture detail,
composition, visual quality, and factual consistency. Each annotation includes
detailed chain-of-thought reasoning to facilitate interpretability and
comprehensive understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVQA-68K
significantly enhances the performance of various multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) on the VQA task, achieving state-of-the-art results not only on
our internal test set (Fig.1) but also on public benchmarks including
LSVQ-test, LSVQ-1080p, and LIVE-VQC. Meantime, incorporating explicit reasoning
process during VQA training substantially boosts the zero-shot generalization.

*Siming Fu,Sijun Dong,Xiaoliang Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyGDL is a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that addresses shortcut learning in SSL by enforcing content-style disentanglement through an invariance pre-training principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised learning suffers from shortcut learning where models exploit superficial features like texture instead of intrinsic structure, which hinders generalization to unseen domains.

Method: Proposes HyGDL framework with single encoder that analytically defines style as orthogonal component to content via vector projection, systematically varying biases while keeping supervision constant.

Result: Not specified in the abstract - requires full paper analysis.

Conclusion: HyGDL addresses shortcut learning at its core by altering the underlying learning mechanism through explicit content-style disentanglement guided by invariance principles.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), its
generalization is fundamentally hindered by Shortcut Learning, where models
exploit superficial features like texture instead of intrinsic structure. We
experimentally verify this flaw within the generative paradigm (e.g., MAE) and
argue it is a systemic issue also affecting discriminative methods, identifying
it as the root cause of their failure on unseen domains. While existing methods
often tackle this at a surface level by aligning or separating domain-specific
features, they fail to alter the underlying learning mechanism that fosters
shortcut dependency. To address this at its core, we propose HyGDL (Hybrid
Generative-Discriminative Learning Framework), a hybrid framework that achieves
explicit content-style disentanglement. Our approach is guided by the
Invariance Pre-training Principle: forcing a model to learn an invariant
essence by systematically varying a bias (e.g., style) at the input while
keeping the supervision signal constant. HyGDL operates on a single encoder and
analytically defines style as the component of a representation that is
orthogonal to its style-invariant content, derived via vector projection.

Conclusion: The proposed frame allocation strategy and complementary benchmarks provide a more comprehensive evaluation framework for video anomaly detection, enabling better assessment of model generalization across different temporal scales.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is critical for surveillance and public safety.
However, existing benchmarks are limited to either frame-level or video-level

to temporally localized segments and incorporates an abnormality scoring
task.Experiments on UCF-Crime demonstrate improvements at both the frame and
video levels, and ablation studies confirm clear advantages of anomaly-focused
sampling over uniform and random baselines.

reenactment in a fully controllable 3D space. Compared to conventional 2D
deepfake approaches that suffer from geometric inconsistencies and limited
generalization to novel view, our method combines a parametric head model with
dynamic Gaussian representations to support multi-view consistent rendering,
precise expression control, and seamless background integration. To address
editing challenges in point-based representations, we explicitly separate the
head and background Gaussians and use pre-trained 2D guidance to optimize the
facial region across views. We further introduce a repair module to enhance
visual consistency under extreme poses and expressions. Experiments on
NeRSemble and additional evaluation videos demonstrate that our method achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art 2D approaches in identity
preservation, as well as pose and expression consistency, while significantly
outperforming them in multi-view rendering quality and 3D consistency. Our
approach bridges the gap between 3D modeling and deepfake synthesis, enabling
new directions for scene-aware, controllable, and immersive visual forgeries,
revealing the threat that emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting technique could be
used for manipulation attacks.

Motivation: Existing tableware cleaning methods suffer from coarse-grained classification and scarcity of few-shot data, making them inadequate for industrialization requirements in food safety and smart home applications.

Method: DTGen uses generative diffusion models with LoRA for efficient domain specialization, structured prompts for diverse dirty image generation, and CLIP-based cross-modal filtering to ensure data quality.

Result: Under extremely limited real few-shot conditions, DTGen can synthesize virtually unlimited high-quality samples, significantly improving classifier performance and supporting fine-grained dirty tableware recognition.

Conclusion: DTGen validates the value of generative AI in few-shot industrial vision and provides a feasible deployment path for automated tableware cleaning and food safety monitoring, with potential for lightweight deployment in embedded dishwashers.

Abstract: Intelligent tableware cleaning is a critical application in food safety and
smart homes, but existing methods are limited by coarse-grained classification
and scarcity of few-shot data, making it difficult to meet industrialization
requirements. We propose DTGen, a few-shot data augmentation scheme based on
generative diffusion models, specifically designed for fine-grained dirty
tableware recognition. DTGen achieves efficient domain specialization through
LoRA, generates diverse dirty images via structured prompts, and ensures data
quality through CLIP-based cross-modal filtering. Under extremely limited real
few-shot conditions, DTGen can synthesize virtually unlimited high-quality
samples, significantly improving classifier performance and supporting
fine-grained dirty tableware recognition. We further elaborate on lightweight
deployment strategies, promising to transfer DTGen's benefits to embedded
dishwashers and integrate with cleaning programs to intelligently regulate
energy consumption and detergent usage. Research results demonstrate that DTGen
not only validates the value of generative AI in few-shot industrial vision but
also provides a feasible deployment path for automated tableware cleaning and
food safety monitoring.

### [83] [IS-Diff: Improving Diffusion-Based Inpainting with Better Initial Seed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11638)
*Yongzhe Lyu,Yu Wu,Yutian Lin,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IS-Diff is a training-free diffusion model that uses distributional harmonious seeds from unmasked areas to improve inpainting consistency and coherence, avoiding biased results from random noise initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random noise initialization in vanilla diffusion models introduces mismatched semantic information in masked regions, leading to biased inpainting results with low consistency and coherence with unmasked areas.

Method: Proposes Initial Seed refined Diffusion Model (IS-Diff) that samples initial seeds from unmasked areas to imitate masked data distribution, plus a dynamic selective refinement mechanism to detect and adjust unharmonious inpaintings.

Result: Validated on CelebA-HQ, ImageNet, and Places2 datasets for standard and large-mask inpainting tasks, showing effectiveness across all metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: IS-Diff provides a training-free approach that produces harmonious inpainting results by using distributional harmonious seeds and dynamic refinement, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promising results in free-form inpainting. Recent
studies based on refined diffusion samplers or novel architectural designs led
to realistic results and high data consistency. However, random initialization
seed (noise) adopted in vanilla diffusion process may introduce mismatched
semantic information in masked regions, leading to biased inpainting results,
e.g., low consistency and low coherence with the other unmasked area. To
address this issue, we propose the Initial Seed refined Diffusion Model
(IS-Diff), a completely training-free approach incorporating distributional
harmonious seeds to produce harmonious results. Specifically, IS-Diff employs
initial seeds sampled from unmasked areas to imitate the masked data
distribution, thereby setting a promising direction for the diffusion
procedure. Moreover, a dynamic selective refinement mechanism is proposed to
detect severe unharmonious inpaintings in intermediate latent and adjust the
strength of our initialization prior dynamically. We validate our method on
both standard and large-mask inpainting tasks using the CelebA-HQ, ImageNet,
and Places2 datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness across all metrics
compared to state-of-the-art inpainting methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MindVL is a multimodal large language model trained on Ascend NPUs that achieves performance comparable to Qwen2.5-VL using only 1/10 of the training data, featuring native-resolution Vision Transformers and specialized training framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient multimodal model that can process images at original variable resolutions without degradation from fixed-resolution tiling, particularly for visually dense content like charts and diagrams, while being optimized for Ascend NPUs.

Method: Uses native-resolution Vision Transformers, three-phase training (warm-up, multitask training, supervised instruction tuning), Mindspeed-MLLM distributed framework, multimodal data packaging, hybrid parallelism, test-time resolution search, and model weight averaging.

Result: Achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL in general multimodal understanding and document/table comprehension despite using only 1/10 of the training data, with leading performance in OCR assessments.

Conclusion: MindVL demonstrates that efficient training frameworks and native-resolution processing can achieve state-of-the-art multimodal performance with significantly reduced training data requirements, particularly excelling in OCR tasks.

Abstract: We propose MindVL, a multimodal large langauge model trained on Ascend NPUs.
Similar to Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL adopts native-resolution Vision Transformers,
which enables it to process images at their original variable resolutions. This
design avoids the degradation caused by fixed-resolution tiling while
preserving fine-grained details and global layouts, which is crucial for
visually dense content such as complex charts and diagrams. To ensure the
smooth training of MindVL on Ascend NPUs, we develop Mindspeed-MLLM, a
distributed multimodal training framework tailored for Ascend NPUs. To maintain
training accuracy, we implement equivalent replacements for certain operators.
MindVL undergoes a three-phase training process, namely the warm-up phase,
multitask training phase, and supervised instruction tuning phase, to gradually
enhance its capabilities. This process starts with basic visual and multimodal
pre-training, followed by large-scale multiask trainging and instruction
tuning. We also adopt multimodal data packaging and hybrid parallelism
techniques, which significantly improve end-to-end training speed. To further
boost model performance, we specifically introduce test-time resolution search
and model weight averaging. Notably, despite using about 1/10 of the training
data required by Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL
in evaluations of general multimodal understanding and document/table
comprehension. Beyond overall scores, MindVL also delivers leading performance
in OCR assessments.

Method: Created a comprehensive real-world dataset with image pairs captured under various weather conditions (rain, snow, haze), diverse outdoor scenes, and illumination settings. Provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images for supervised learning.

Result: The dataset enables rigorous evaluation and benchmarking of task-specific, task-general, and all-in-one restoration methods. Comprehensive experiments were conducted to validate its utility.

Conclusion: The dataset provides a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical all-in-one image restoration in real-world scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released to support further research.

Abstract: Existing all-in-one image restoration approaches, which aim to handle
multiple weather degradations within a single framework, are predominantly
trained and evaluated using mixed single-weather synthetic datasets. However,
these datasets often differ significantly in resolution, style, and domain
characteristics, leading to substantial domain gaps that hinder the development
and fair evaluation of unified models. Furthermore, the lack of a large-scale,
real-world all-in-one weather restoration dataset remains a critical bottleneck
in advancing this field. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
all-in-one adverse weather image restoration benchmark dataset, which contains
image pairs captured under various weather conditions, including rain, snow,
and haze, as well as diverse outdoor scenes and illumination settings. The
resulting dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images,
enabling supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of task-specific, task-general, and
all-in-one restoration methods on our dataset. Our dataset offers a valuable
foundation for advancing robust and practical all-in-one image restoration in
real-world scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released and is available

a novel architecture integrating multiple feature extraction modules with the
Mamba state-space model. Moreover, existing joint segmentation models for OCTA
data exhibit performance imbalance between different tasks. To simultaneously
improve the segmentation of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and mitigate this

TL;DR: DGMap is a dual-decoding framework that addresses uneven trajectory density issues in map inference by improving keypoint detection in sparse areas and suppressing false connections in dense regions using global context awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uneven trajectory density causes fragmented roads in sparse areas and redundant segments in dense regions, posing challenges for existing map inference methods from trajectory data.

Method: Proposes DGMap with Multi-scale Grid Encoding, Mask-enhanced Keypoint Extraction, and Global Context-aware Relation Prediction to integrate global semantic context with local geometric features.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5% in APLS on three real-world datasets, with notable performance gains on Didi Chuxing platform trajectory data.

Conclusion: DGMap effectively addresses trajectory density challenges through global context integration, reducing fragmentation in sparse areas and suppressing false connections in dense regions.

Abstract: Trajectory data has become a key resource for automated map in-ference due to
its low cost, broad coverage, and continuous availability. However, uneven
trajectory density often leads to frag-mented roads in sparse areas and
redundant segments in dense regions, posing significant challenges for existing
methods. To address these issues, we propose DGMap, a dual-decoding framework
with global context awareness, featuring Multi-scale Grid Encoding,
Mask-enhanced Keypoint Extraction, and Global Context-aware Relation
Prediction. By integrating global semantic context with local geometric
features, DGMap improves keypoint detection accuracy to reduce road
fragmentation in sparse-trajectory areas. Additionally, the Global
Context-aware Relation Prediction module suppresses false connections in
dense-trajectory regions by modeling long-range trajectory patterns.
Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that DGMap outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by 5% in APLS, with notable performance gains on

*Haiduo Huang,Fuwei Yang,Zhenhua Liu,Xuanwu Yin,Dong Li,Pengju Ren,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecVLM accelerates vision-language models using speculative decoding with an elastic visual compressor and online training protocol, achieving 2.5-2.9x speedups while maintaining lossless decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct speculative decoding for VLMs faces challenges due to visual token dominance in prefill stage, causing compute/memory inflation from high-resolution images and videos requiring large KV cache.

Method: Combines EAGLE-2-style baseline (EagleVLM) with elastic visual compressor that adaptively selects compression primitives (pruning, pooling, convolution, resampler) and online-logit distillation protocol using teacher logits and features with cross-entropy + Smooth L1 loss.

Result: Achieves 1.5-2.3x speedups with baseline, and 2.5-2.9x end-to-end speedups within 5 epochs across LLaVA and MMMU models, consistent across resolutions and task difficulties while preserving output distribution.

Conclusion: SpecVLM provides practical acceleration for VLMs through adaptive visual compression and efficient online training, demonstrating training-time scaling effects and maintaining lossless decoding performance.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a powerful way to accelerate autoregressive large
language models (LLMs), but directly porting it to vision-language models
(VLMs) faces unique systems constraints: the prefill stage is dominated by
visual tokens whose count scales with image resolution and video length,
inflating both compute and memory, especially the key-value (KV) cache. We
study speculative decoding for VLMs and introduce SpecVLM, a practical system
that (1) establishes a strong EAGLE-2-style baseline, EagleVLM, delivering
1.5--2.3x end-to-end speedups over full autoregressive inference, and (2)
further accelerates VLM inference with an elastic visual compressor that
adaptively selects among pruning, pooling, convolution, and resampler
primitives to balance FLOPs/parameters and accuracy per input. To avoid costly
offline distillation corpora, we propose an online-logit distillation protocol
that trains the draft model with on-the-fly teacher logits and penultimate
features using a combined cross-entropy and Smooth L1 objective, eliminating
storage and preprocessing while remaining compute-efficient. This protocol
reveals a training-time scaling effect: longer online training monotonically
increases the draft model's average accepted length, improving speculative
efficiency. Empirically, SpecVLM achieves additional acceleration, culminating
in 2.5--2.9x end-to-end speedups within 5 epochs across LLaVA and MMMU,
consistently over resolutions and task difficulties, while preserving the
target model's output distribution (lossless decoding). Our code is available
at https://github.com/haiduo/SpecVLM.

Abstract: Paper maps remain widely used for hiking and sightseeing because they contain
curated trails and locally relevant annotations that are often missing from
digital navigation applications such as Google Maps. We propose a pipeline to
extract navigable trails from scanned maps, enabling their use in GPS-based

components, showing that the approach can robustly recover trail networks from
diverse map styles and generate GPS routes suitable for practical use.

TL;DR: A scalable probabilistic verification framework for semantic segmentation networks that combines sampling-based reachability analysis with conformal inference to provide reliable safety guarantees while reducing conservatism in high-dimensional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing probabilistic verification approaches struggle to scale with modern segmentation tasks' complexity and dimensionality, yielding overly conservative guarantees that limit practical applicability in safety-critical domains like medical imaging and autonomous driving.

Method: Combines sampling-based reachability analysis with conformal inference (CI), introducing novel strategies to reduce CI's conservatism in high-dimensional settings while maintaining rigor. The approach is architecture-agnostic and scalable to high-dimensional outputs.

Result: Empirical evaluation on large-scale segmentation models across CamVid, OCTA-500, Lung Segmentation, and Cityscapes demonstrates reliable safety guarantees with substantially tighter bounds compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a practical solution for probabilistic verification of semantic segmentation networks, offering provable guarantees without excessive conservatism, along with an open-source toolbox implementation.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation networks (SSNs) play a critical role in domains such as
medical imaging, autonomous driving, and environmental monitoring, where safety
hinges on reliable model behavior under uncertainty. Yet, existing
probabilistic verification approaches struggle to scale with the complexity and
dimensionality of modern segmentation tasks, often yielding guarantees that are
too conservative to be practical. We introduce a probabilistic verification
framework that is both architecture-agnostic and scalable to high-dimensional
outputs. Our approach combines sampling-based reachability analysis with
conformal inference (CI) to deliver provable guarantees while avoiding the
excessive conservatism of prior methods. To counteract CI's limitations in
high-dimensional settings, we propose novel strategies that reduce conservatism
without compromising rigor. Empirical evaluation on large-scale segmentation
models across CamVid, OCTA-500, Lung Segmentation, and Cityscapes demonstrates
that our method provides reliable safety guarantees while substantially
tightening bounds compared to SOTA. We also provide a toolbox implementing this
technique, available on Github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation benchmarks use everyday textured objects, limiting generalization to industrial settings where objects are metallic, texture-less, and highly reflective.

Method: Created IMD dataset with 45 true-to-scale industrial components captured using RGB-D camera under natural lighting and varied arrangements. Evaluated state-of-the-art models (XMem, SAM2, BundleTrack, BundleSDF) on three tasks: video segmentation, 6D pose tracking, and one-shot pose estimation.

Result: The industrial dataset proved more challenging than existing household object datasets, highlighting performance gaps in current models when applied to industrial scenarios.

Conclusion: IMD provides a baseline for developing and comparing segmentation and pose estimation algorithms that better generalize to industrial robotics applications.

Abstract: Object 6DoF (6D) pose estimation is essential for robotic perception,
especially in industrial settings. It enables robots to interact with the
environment and manipulate objects. However, existing benchmarks on object 6D
pose estimation primarily use everyday objects with rich textures and
low-reflectivity, limiting model generalization to industrial scenarios where
objects are often metallic, texture-less, and highly reflective. To address
this gap, we propose a novel dataset and benchmark namely \textit{Industrial
Metallic Dataset (IMD)}, tailored for industrial applications. Our dataset
comprises 45 true-to-scale industrial components, captured with an RGB-D camera
under natural indoor lighting and varied object arrangements to replicate
real-world conditions. The benchmark supports three tasks, including video
object segmentation, 6D pose tracking, and one-shot 6D pose estimation. We
evaluate existing state-of-the-art models, including XMem and SAM2 for
segmentation, and BundleTrack and BundleSDF for pose estimation, to assess
model performance in industrial contexts. Evaluation results show that our
industrial dataset is more challenging than existing household object datasets.
This benchmark provides the baseline for developing and comparing segmentation

Motivation: Current vision language models for video QA rely on shallow correlations and lack strong temporal grounding and interpretability. Symbolic scene graphs can provide structured object-relation representations to complement VLM reasoning.

Method: SG-VLM is a modular framework that combines frozen VLMs with scene graph grounding through prompting and visual localization techniques, using symbolic scene graphs as intermediate grounding signals.

Result: SG-VLM improves causal and temporal reasoning across three benchmarks (NExT-QA, iVQA, ActivityNet-QA) with multiple VLMs (QwenVL, InternVL), outperforming prior baselines though gains over strong VLMs are limited.

Conclusion: Symbolic scene graph grounding shows promise but has current limitations, offering guidance for future hybrid VLM-symbolic approaches in video understanding.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) requires models to reason over spatial,
temporal, and causal cues in videos. Recent vision language models (VLMs)
achieve strong results but often rely on shallow correlations, leading to weak
temporal grounding and limited interpretability. We study symbolic scene graphs
(SGs) as intermediate grounding signals for VQA. SGs provide structured
object-relation representations that complement VLMs holistic reasoning. We
introduce SG-VLM, a modular framework that integrates frozen VLMs with scene
graph grounding via prompting and visual localization. Across three benchmarks
(NExT-QA, iVQA, ActivityNet-QA) and multiple VLMs (QwenVL, InternVL), SG-VLM
improves causal and temporal reasoning and outperforms prior baselines, though
gains over strong VLMs are limited. These findings highlight both the promise

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Ensembles improve medical image segmentation but increase training and testing costs with more ensembles. Need for efficient uncertainty estimation in retinal vessel analysis.

Method: Propose Ensemble Distillation to distill knowledge from multiple ensemble models into a single model, reducing computational complexity.

Result: Achieves comparable performance via calibration and segmentation metrics on DRIVE and FIVES datasets while significantly reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Ensemble Distillation provides an efficient and reliable approach for uncertainty estimation in retinal vessel segmentation, making it promising for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is critical for reliable medical image segmentation,
particularly in retinal vessel analysis, where accurate predictions are
essential for diagnostic applications. Deep Ensembles, where multiple networks
are trained individually, are widely used to improve medical image segmentation
performance. However, training and testing costs increase with the number of
ensembles. In this work, we propose Ensemble Distillation as a robust
alternative to commonly used uncertainty estimation techniques by distilling
the knowledge of multiple ensemble models into a single model. Through
extensive experiments on the DRIVE and FIVES datasets, we demonstrate that
Ensemble Distillation achieves comparable performance via calibration and
segmentation metrics, while significantly reducing computational complexity.
These findings suggest that Ensemble distillation provides an efficient and
reliable approach for uncertainty estimation in the segmentation of the retinal
vessels, making it a promising tool for medical imaging applications.

TL;DR: Depthwise separable CNNs naturally converge to just 8 universal filters that are linear shifts of fundamental patterns like Difference of Gaussians, achieving strong performance even when frozen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the Master Key Filters Hypothesis by showing that DS-CNNs inherently converge to a minimal set of universal filters regardless of architecture or dataset.

Method: Systematic unsupervised search across different architectures and datasets to extract fundamental filter patterns, then testing networks initialized with these 8 frozen filters.

Result: Networks with just 8 unique frozen filters achieve over 80% ImageNet accuracy and outperform models with thousands of trainable parameters on smaller datasets.

Conclusion: Depthwise convolutional layers naturally gravitate toward fundamental spatial operators similar to classical image processing and biological visual systems, providing insights for generalization and transfer learning.

Abstract: A recent study has proposed the "Master Key Filters Hypothesis" for
convolutional neural network filters. This paper extends this hypothesis by
radically constraining its scope to a single set of just 8 universal filters
that depthwise separable convolutional networks inherently converge to. While
conventional DS-CNNs employ thousands of distinct trained filters, our analysis
reveals these filters are predominantly linear shifts (ax+b) of our discovered
universal set. Through systematic unsupervised search, we extracted these
fundamental patterns across different architectures and datasets. Remarkably,
networks initialized with these 8 unique frozen filters achieve over 80%
ImageNet accuracy, and even outperform models with thousands of trainable
parameters when applied to smaller datasets. The identified master key filters
closely match Difference of Gaussians (DoGs), Gaussians, and their derivatives,
structures that are not only fundamental to classical image processing but also
strikingly similar to receptive fields in mammalian visual systems. Our
findings provide compelling evidence that depthwise convolutional layers
naturally gravitate toward this fundamental set of spatial operators regardless
of task or architecture. This work offers new insights for understanding
generalization and transfer learning through the universal language of these
master key filters.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a flexible framework for incremental 3DSSG prediction that works without full scene reconstructions, making it suitable for real-world robotics and embodied AI applications.

Abstract: 3D semantic scene graphs (3DSSG) provide compact structured representations
of environments by explicitly modeling objects, attributes, and relationships.
While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing
methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from
semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to
complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world,
incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model
for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal
information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing
process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and
local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene
reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that
GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g.,
CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for
complex, real-world environments. The full source code of the presented
architecture will be made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel open-vocabulary segmentation framework (RSKT-Seg) for remote sensing images that addresses domain gaps through multi-directional cost map aggregation, efficient fusion, and knowledge transfer, achieving significant performance improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (OVRSIS) is underexplored due to lack of standardized benchmarks and domain gaps between natural and remote sensing images, requiring specialized solutions.

Method: Proposed RSKT-Seg framework with three components: Multi-Directional Cost Map Aggregation (RS-CMA) for rotation-invariant features, Efficient Cost Map Fusion (RS-Fusion) transformer for spatial-semantic modeling, and Remote Sensing Knowledge Transfer (RS-Transfer) module for domain adaptation.

Result: Outperforms strong OVS baselines by +3.8 mIoU and +5.9 mACC while achieving 2x faster inference through efficient aggregation on the established OVRSISBench benchmark.

Conclusion: RSKT-Seg effectively bridges the domain gap in remote sensing segmentation and provides a standardized evaluation framework, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency for open-vocabulary remote sensing image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (OVRSIS), an emerging task
that adapts Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) to the remote sensing (RS)
domain, remains underexplored due to the absence of a unified evaluation
benchmark and the domain gap between natural and RS images. To bridge these
gaps, we first establish a standardized OVRSIS benchmark (\textbf{OVRSISBench})
based on widely-used RS segmentation datasets, enabling consistent evaluation
across methods. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate several
representative OVS/OVRSIS models and reveal their limitations when directly
applied to remote sensing scenarios. Building on these insights, we propose
\textbf{RSKT-Seg}, a novel open-vocabulary segmentation framework tailored for
remote sensing. RSKT-Seg integrates three key components: (1) a
Multi-Directional Cost Map Aggregation (RS-CMA) module that captures
rotation-invariant visual cues by computing vision-language cosine similarities
across multiple directions; (2) an Efficient Cost Map Fusion (RS-Fusion)
transformer, which jointly models spatial and semantic dependencies with a
lightweight dimensionality reduction strategy; and (3) a Remote Sensing
Knowledge Transfer (RS-Transfer) module that injects pre-trained knowledge and
facilitates domain adaptation via enhanced upsampling. Extensive experiments on
the benchmark show that RSKT-Seg consistently outperforms strong OVS baselines
by +3.8 mIoU and +5.9 mACC, while achieving 2x faster inference through
efficient aggregation. Our code is

TL;DR: SMARLI is a novel framework that integrates layout constraints into autoregressive image generation using structured masking and reinforcement learning, achieving superior layout control without compromising generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models face challenges in layout-conditioned image generation due to sparse layout conditions and feature entanglement risks, requiring better integration of spatial constraints.

Method: Uses structured masking strategy in attention computation to control interactions between global prompt, layout, and image tokens, plus Group Relative Policy Optimization with layout reward functions for post-training.

Result: Achieves seamless integration of layout tokens with text and image tokens, maintaining generation quality while providing superior layout-aware control with structural simplicity.

Conclusion: SMARLI effectively addresses layout-conditioned generation challenges in AR models through structured masking and reinforcement learning, preserving generation efficiency while enabling precise layout control.

Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated remarkable success in
image generation, extending them to layout-conditioned generation remains
challenging due to the sparse nature of layout conditions and the risk of
feature entanglement. We present Structured Masking for AR-based
Layout-to-Image (SMARLI), a novel framework for layoutto-image generation that
effectively integrates spatial layout constraints into AR-based image
generation. To equip AR model with layout control, a specially designed
structured masking strategy is applied to attention computation to govern the
interaction among the global prompt, layout, and image tokens. This design
prevents mis-association between different regions and their descriptions while
enabling sufficient injection of layout constraints into the generation
process. To further enhance generation quality and layout accuracy, we
incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based post-training
scheme with specially designed layout reward functions for next-set-based AR
models. Experimental results demonstrate that SMARLI is able to seamlessly
integrate layout tokens with text and image tokens without compromising
generation quality. It achieves superior layoutaware control while maintaining
the structural simplicity and generation efficiency of AR models.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) that can effectively learn ultrasound
representations by integrating multi-source data holds significant promise for
advancing clinical care. However, the scarcity of large labeled datasets in
real-world clinical environments and the limited generalizability of
task-specific models have hindered the development of generalizable clinical AI
models for ultrasound applications. In this study, we present EchoCare, a novel
ultrasound foundation model for generalist clinical use, developed via
self-supervised learning on our curated, publicly available, large-scale
dataset EchoCareData. EchoCareData comprises 4.5 million ultrasound images,
sourced from over 23 countries across 5 continents and acquired via a diverse
range of distinct imaging devices, thus encompassing global cohorts that are
multi-center, multi-device, and multi-ethnic. Unlike prior studies that adopt

hierarchical classifier into EchoCare to enable joint learning of pixel-level
and representation-level features, capturing both global anatomical contexts
and local ultrasound characteristics. With minimal training, EchoCare
outperforms state-of-the-art comparison models across 10 representative
ultrasound benchmarks of varying diagnostic difficulties, spanning disease
diagnosis, lesion segmentation, organ detection, landmark prediction,
quantitative regression, imaging enhancement and report generation. The code

### [102] [Lost in Embeddings: Information Loss in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11986)
*Wenyan Li,Raphael Tang,Chengzu Li,Caiqi Zhang,Ivan Vulić,Anders Søgaard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs suffer from significant information loss when projecting visual representations into language space through connectors, causing 40-60% distortion in nearest neighbors and degraded performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify and analyze the information loss that occurs when vision encoders project visual inputs into language model embedding space through connector components in vision-language models.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Analyze semantic preservation by comparing k-nearest neighbor relationships before/after projection, 2) Measure information loss by reconstructing visual embeddings from projected representations at patch level.

Result: Connectors substantially distort local geometry of visual representations (40-60% divergence in k-NN), correlating with retrieval performance degradation. Patch-level reconstruction shows high information loss areas predict where models struggle on visual QA tasks.

Conclusion: The projection step in VLMs causes significant information loss that impacts model capabilities, and patch-level analysis provides interpretable insights for understanding model failures.

Abstract: Vision--language models (VLMs) often process visual inputs through a
pretrained vision encoder, followed by a projection into the language model's
embedding space via a connector component. While crucial for modality fusion,
the potential information loss induced by this projection step and its direct
impact on model capabilities remain understudied. We introduce two
complementary approaches to examine and quantify this loss by analyzing the
latent representation space. First, we evaluate semantic information
preservation by analyzing changes in k-nearest neighbor relationships between
image representations, before and after projection. Second, we directly measure
information loss by reconstructing visual embeddings from the projected
representation, localizing loss at an image patch level. Experiments reveal
that connectors substantially distort the local geometry of visual
representations, with k-nearest neighbors diverging by 40--60\%
post-projection, correlating with degradation in retrieval performance. The
patch-level embedding reconstruction provides interpretable insights for model
behavior on visually grounded question-answering tasks, finding that areas of
high information loss reliably predict instances where models struggle.

TL;DR: Proposes MSMA framework for 3D face reconstruction from single unconstrained images using multi-scale feature fusion and multi-attribute learning with large-kernel attention to improve feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with detailed and multi-scale feature capture under diverse facial conditions, require substantial 3D data which is costly to obtain, and often produce incomplete or inaccurate reconstructions.

Method: Multi-Scale Feature Fusion with Multi-Attribute (MSMA) framework that integrates multi-scale feature fusion with multi-attribute learning and uses large-kernel attention module for enhanced precision in feature extraction across scales.

Result: Achieves results on par with current state-of-the-art methods on MICC Florence, Facewarehouse and custom datasets, and surpasses SOTA performance in some challenging conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed MSMA framework effectively addresses limitations in capturing detailed multi-scale features for 3D face reconstruction from unconstrained images, demonstrating competitive and sometimes superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D face from a single unconstrained image remains a
challenging problem due to diverse conditions in unconstrained environments.
Recently, learning-based methods have achieved notable results by effectively
capturing complex facial structures and details across varying conditions.
Consequently, many existing approaches employ projection-based losses between
generated and input images to constrain model training. However, learning-based
methods for 3D face reconstruction typically require substantial amounts of 3D
facial data, which is difficult and costly to obtain. Consequently, to reduce
reliance on labeled 3D face datasets, many existing approaches employ
projection-based losses between generated and input images to constrain model
training. Nonetheless, despite these advancements, existing approaches
frequently struggle to capture detailed and multi-scale features under diverse
facial attributes and conditions, leading to incomplete or less accurate
reconstructions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion with
Multi-Attribute (MSMA) framework for 3D face reconstruction from unconstrained
images. Our method integrates multi-scale feature fusion with a focus on
multi-attribute learning and leverages a large-kernel attention module to
enhance the precision of feature extraction across scales, enabling accurate 3D
facial parameter estimation from a single 2D image. Comprehensive experiments
on the MICC Florence, Facewarehouse and custom-collect datasets demonstrate
that our approach achieves results on par with current state-of-the-art
methods, and in some instances, surpasses SOTA performance across challenging
conditions.

Motivation: Accurate segmentation of dental anatomies in CBCT is critical for clinical applications but remains time-consuming and challenging, requiring more efficient and effective solutions.

Method: Integrates Mamba2 state space models into U-Net architecture, incorporates interactive click prompts with cross-attention blocks, uses self-supervised pre-training, and embeds dental domain knowledge.

Result: Achieved mean Dice of 0.792 and HD95 of 93.19 in Task 1, and mean Dice of 0.852 and HD95 of 7.39 in Task 2, securing top 3 positions in both tasks of ToothFairy3 challenge.

Conclusion: U-Mamba2 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency for dental CBCT segmentation, providing a state-of-the-art solution that balances performance with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is a widely used 3D imaging technique in
dentistry, providing volumetric information about the anatomical structures of
jaws and teeth. Accurate segmentation of these anatomies is critical for
clinical applications such as diagnosis and surgical planning, but remains
time-consuming and challenging. In this paper, we present U-Mamba2, a new
neural network architecture designed for multi-anatomy CBCT segmentation in the
context of the ToothFairy3 challenge. U-Mamba2 integrates the Mamba2 state
space models into the U-Net architecture, enforcing stronger structural
constraints for higher efficiency without compromising performance. In
addition, we integrate interactive click prompts with cross-attention blocks,
pre-train U-Mamba2 using self-supervised learning, and incorporate dental
domain knowledge into the model design to address key challenges of dental
anatomy segmentation in CBCT. Extensive experiments, including independent
tests, demonstrate that U-Mamba2 is both effective and efficient, securing top

TL;DR: Reflection-V enhances visual reasoning in VLMs by improving visual reflection through vision-centered data construction and visual attention rewards during RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models show limited visual reflection capability - their attention to visual information diminishes with longer responses, hindering effective visual reasoning.

Method: 1) Construct vision-centered reasoning data using an agent that interacts between VLMs and reasoning LLMs for cold-start learning. 2) Use visual attention-based reward model during reinforcement learning to encourage visual information-based reasoning.

Result: Significant improvements across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks. Maintains stronger and more consistent reliance on visual information during reasoning.

Conclusion: Reflection-V effectively enhances visual reflection capabilities in vision-language models, enabling better visual reasoning performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-only "slow-thinking" reasoning have prompted efforts
to transfer this capability to vision-language models (VLMs), for training
visual reasoning models (\textbf{VRMs}). owever, such transfer faces critical
challenges: Effective "slow thinking" in VRMs requires \textbf{visual
reflection}, the ability to check the reasoning process based on visual
information. Through quantitative analysis, we observe that current VRMs
exhibit limited visual reflection, as their attention to visual information
diminishes rapidly with longer generated responses. To address this challenge,
we propose a new VRM \textbf{Reflection-V}, which enhances visual reflection
based on reasoning data construction for cold-start and reward design for
reinforcement learning (RL). Firstly, we construct vision-centered reasoning
data by leveraging an agent that interacts between VLMs and reasoning LLMs,
enabling cold-start learning of visual reflection patterns. Secondly, a visual
attention based reward model is employed during RL to encourage reasoning based
on visual information. Therefore, \textbf{Reflection-V} demonstrates
significant improvements across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.
Furthermore, \textbf{Reflection-V} maintains a stronger and more consistent
reliance on visual information during visual reasoning, indicating effective
enhancement in visual reflection capabilities.

Motivation: Autonomous systems need robust MOT capabilities, but existing foundation models like SAM2 have limitations in identity management and memory efficiency when applied to MOTS tasks.

Method: Integrates pre-trained object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module for track initialization, management, and reinforcement. Uses a sliding-window memory strategy and remains detector-agnostic without requiring fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance, ranking 4th overall on KITTI MOTS benchmarks for car and pedestrian classes, establishes new benchmark in association accuracy (AssA), and reduces memory usage by 75% with negligible performance degradation.

Conclusion: Seg2Track-SAM2 advances MOTS by combining robust zero-shot tracking, enhanced identity preservation, and efficient memory utilization, supporting deployment under resource constraints.

Abstract: Autonomous systems require robust Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) capabilities to
operate reliably in dynamic environments. MOT ensures consistent object
identity assignment and precise spatial delineation. Recent advances in
foundation models, such as SAM2, have demonstrated strong zero-shot
generalization for video segmentation, but their direct application to MOTS
(MOT+Segmentation) remains limited by insufficient identity management and
memory efficiency. This work introduces Seg2Track-SAM2, a framework that
integrates pre-trained object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module
to address track initialization, track management, and reinforcement. The
proposed approach requires no fine-tuning and remains detector-agnostic.
Experimental results on KITTI MOT and KITTI MOTS benchmarks show that
Seg2Track-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, ranking fourth
overall in both car and pedestrian classes on KITTI MOTS, while establishing a
new benchmark in association accuracy (AssA). Furthermore, a sliding-window
memory strategy reduces memory usage by up to 75% with negligible performance
degradation, supporting deployment under resource constraints. These results

Motivation: Existing SA-UNet underuses attention in skip connections and fails to address severe foreground-background imbalance in retinal vessel segmentation, which is crucial for early disease diagnosis.

Method: Proposes SA-UNetv2 with cross-scale spatial attention injected into all skip connections for better multi-scale feature fusion, and uses weighted BCE plus MCC loss to handle class imbalance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DRIVE and STARE datasets with only 1.2MB memory, 0.26M parameters (less than 50% of SA-UNet), and 1 second CPU inference on 592x592x3 images.

Conclusion: SA-UNetv2 demonstrates strong efficiency and deployability in resource-constrained, CPU-only settings for retinal vessel segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of diseases such
as diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, and neurodegenerative disorders.
Although SA-UNet introduces spatial attention in the bottleneck, it underuses
attention in skip connections and does not address the severe
foreground-background imbalance. We propose SA-UNetv2, a lightweight model that
injects cross-scale spatial attention into all skip connections to strengthen
multi-scale feature fusion and adopts a weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
plus Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) loss to improve robustness to class
imbalance. On the public DRIVE and STARE datasets, SA-UNetv2 achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1.2MB memory and 0.26M parameters (less
than 50% of SA-UNet), and 1 second CPU inference on 592 x 592 x 3 images,

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has
shown potential in general video understanding but faces significant challenges
when applied to the inherently complex domain of sports videos. In this work,
we propose FineQuest, the first training-free framework that leverages
dual-mode reasoning inspired by cognitive science: i) Reactive Reasoning for

Result: Best model achieved 78.98% accuracy, 76.54% sensitivity, 81.58% specificity, 81.58% precision, and 78.98% F1-score using stratified 10-fold cross-validation on REST-meta-MDD dataset. Atlas-based models consistently outperformed cube-based approach.

Conclusion: The proposed ViT+GNN pipeline effectively detects MDD from sMRI data, with atlas-based methods showing superior performance, highlighting the importance of domain-specific anatomical priors for accurate MDD detection.

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental health condition that
negatively impacts both individual well-being and global public health.
Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI)
and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving
diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods
employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations
built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex
brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and
Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for
defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and
functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are
trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches.
Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional
relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were
conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of
our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained
78.98% accuracy, 76.54% sensitivity, 81.58% specificity, 81.58% precision, and
78.98% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the
cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific
anatomical priors for MDD detection.

*Ang Nan Gu,Michael Tsang,Hooman Vaseli,Purang Abolmaesumi,Teresa Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that uses neural network training dynamics to generate uncertainty-aware pseudo-labels for medical image diagnosis, addressing the problem of overconfident predictions from one-hot labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical AI systems use simplistic one-hot labels that ignore diagnostic uncertainty and inter-rater variability, leading to overconfident predictions especially with noisy or ambiguous medical images.

Method: Leverages neural network training dynamics to assess sample difficulty, aggregates and calibrates model predictions during training to generate uncertainty-aware pseudo-labels that can be applied to any supervised learning pipeline.

Result: Superior performance on echocardiography classification benchmark compared to specialized baselines in calibration, selective classification, and multi-view fusion.

Conclusion: The proposed uncertainty-aware label augmentation framework enhances model robustness and uncertainty estimation in medical diagnosis systems, making them more reliable for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis systems must make critical decisions from medical
images that are often noisy, ambiguous, or conflicting, yet today's models are
trained on overly simplistic labels that ignore diagnostic uncertainty. One-hot
labels erase inter-rater variability and force models to make overconfident
predictions, especially when faced with incomplete or artifact-laden inputs. We
address this gap by introducing a novel framework that brings uncertainty back
into the label space. Our method leverages neural network training dynamics
(NNTD) to assess the inherent difficulty of each training sample. By
aggregating and calibrating model predictions during training, we generate
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labels that reflect the ambiguity encountered during
learning. This label augmentation approach is architecture-agnostic and can be
applied to any supervised learning pipeline to enhance uncertainty estimation
and robustness. We validate our approach on a challenging echocardiography
classification benchmark, demonstrating superior performance over specialized
baselines in calibration, selective classification, and multi-view fusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for retinal vessel segmentation struggle with extracting tiny vessels and have high computational costs, making them unsuitable for real-world clinical settings with limited resources.

Method: Incorporates focal modulation attention at the encoder-decoder bottleneck and region-aware attention in selective skip connections to enhance feature representation and regional focus while capturing local and global dependencies efficiently.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art models on DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB datasets with Dice scores of 84.28%, 88.44%, 85.50% and Jaccard indices of 72.86%, 79.31%, 74.70% respectively, while maintaining lightweight characteristics.

Conclusion: LFRA-Net provides an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and computational cost, making it suitable for real-time clinical applications in resource-limited areas.

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is critical for the early diagnosis of
vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in real-world clinical
settings with limited computational resources. Although significant
improvements have been made in deep learning-based segmentation methods,
current models still face challenges in extracting tiny vessels and suffer from
high computational costs. In this study, we present LFRA-Net by incorporating
focal modulation attention at the encoder-decoder bottleneck and region-aware
attention in the selective skip connections. LFRA-Net is a lightweight network
optimized for precise and effective retinal vascular segmentation. It enhances
feature representation and regional focus by efficiently capturing local and
global dependencies. LFRA-Net outperformed many state-of-the-art models while
maintaining lightweight characteristics with only 0.17 million parameters, 0.66
MB memory size, and 10.50 GFLOPs. We validated it on three publicly available
datasets: DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE\_DB. It performed better in terms of Dice
score (84.28\%, 88.44\%, and 85.50\%) and Jaccard index (72.86\%, 79.31\%, and
74.70\%) on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE\_DB datasets, respectively. LFRA-Net
provides an ideal ratio between segmentation accuracy and computational cost
compared to existing deep learning methods, which makes it suitable for
real-time clinical applications in areas with limited resources. The code can

*Liying Wang,Xiaoli Zhang,Chuanmin Jia,Siwei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAFS is a unified network that simultaneously handles infrared-visible image fusion and semantic segmentation through parallel sub-networks with mutual promotion between tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods don't explore the reciprocal relationship between pixel-level image fusion and cross-modal feature fusion from a task-level perspective, limiting performance in both areas.

Method: Parallel structure with fusion and segmentation sub-networks, heterogeneous feature fusion strategy, multi-stage Transformer decoder, and dynamic weighting based on max-min fairness allocation for multi-task training.

Result: Achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods in both image fusion quality and semantic segmentation performance.

Conclusion: The proposed MAFS framework successfully demonstrates that joint optimization of image fusion and semantic segmentation tasks can mutually enhance each other's performance through knowledge transfer and adaptive multi-task learning.

Abstract: Infrared-visible image fusion methods aim at generating fused images with
good visual quality and also facilitate the performance of high-level tasks.
Indeed, existing semantic-driven methods have considered semantic information
injection for downstream applications. However, none of them investigates the
potential for reciprocal promotion between pixel-wise image fusion and
cross-modal feature fusion perception tasks from a macroscopic task-level
perspective. To address this limitation, we propose a unified network for image
fusion and semantic segmentation. MAFS is a parallel structure, containing a
fusion sub-network and a segmentation sub-network. On the one hand, We devise a
heterogeneous feature fusion strategy to enhance semantic-aware capabilities
for image fusion. On the other hand, by cascading the fusion sub-network and a
segmentation backbone, segmentation-related knowledge is transferred to promote
feature-level fusion-based segmentation. Within the framework, we design a
novel multi-stage Transformer decoder to aggregate fine-grained multi-scale
fused features efficiently. Additionally, a dynamic factor based on the max-min
fairness allocation principle is introduced to generate adaptive weights of two
tasks and guarantee smooth training in a multi-task manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results compared
with state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

*Johanna Karras,Yingwei Li,Yasamin Jafarian,Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloGarment enables 360° novel view synthesis of real-world garments from 1-3 images or videos by bridging synthetic-real domain gap with implicit training and garment atlas representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely on synthetic 3D training data of static, unoccluded objects, which poorly generalizes to real-world garments with occlusions, complex poses, and deformations.

Method: Uses novel implicit training paradigm combining large-scale real video data with small-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize shared garment embedding space. Creates garment "atlas" representation during inference for dynamic video-to-360° NVS.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on novel view synthesis of in-the-wild garments, robustly handling wrinkling, pose variation, occlusion while maintaining photorealism, view consistency, fine texture details, and accurate geometry.

Conclusion: HoloGarment effectively bridges the synthetic-real domain gap for garment NVS, enabling high-quality 360° view generation from limited real-world input while handling challenging real-world artifacts.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) of in-the-wild garments is a challenging task due
significant occlusions, complex human poses, and cloth deformations. Prior
methods rely on synthetic 3D training data consisting of mostly unoccluded and
static objects, leading to poor generalization on real-world clothing. In this
paper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3
images or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates
360{\deg} novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to
bridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit
training paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and
small-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.
During inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic
video-to-360{\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment "atlas"
representation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world
video. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all
viewpoints, independent of body pose or motion. Extensive experiments show that
HoloGarment achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS of in-the-wild
garments from images and videos. Notably, our method robustly handles
challenging real-world artifacts -- such as wrinkling, pose variation, and
occlusion -- while maintaining photorealism, view consistency, fine texture
details, and accurate geometry. Visit our project page for additional results:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper bridges generative VLMs and dense vision-language alignment by using synthetic descriptions from VLMs for zero-shot segmentation, achieving better performance and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative vision-language models lack spatially dense alignment between vision and language, while existing dense alignment methods don't leverage the high-level semantic understanding from generative VLMs.

Method: Densely align images with synthetic descriptions generated by vision-language models, using these inexpensive and scalable synthetic captions as a source of high-level semantic understanding.

Result: Outperforms prior work on standard zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks/datasets while being more data-efficient.

Conclusion: Synthetic captions from VLMs provide an excellent scalable source for dense vision-language alignment, effectively bridging generative capabilities with dense representation learning.

Abstract: Generative vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong high-level image
understanding but lack spatially dense alignment between vision and language
modalities, as our findings indicate. Orthogonal to advancements in generative
VLMs, another line of research has focused on representation learning for
vision-language alignment, targeting zero-shot inference for dense tasks like
segmentation. In this work, we bridge these two directions by densely aligning
images with synthetic descriptions generated by VLMs. Synthetic captions are
inexpensive, scalable, and easy to generate, making them an excellent source of
high-level semantic understanding for dense alignment methods. Empirically, our
approach outperforms prior work on standard zero-shot open-vocabulary
segmentation benchmarks/datasets, while also being more data-efficient.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDI-GS is a method that uses segmentation to reduce 3D Gaussian count by 50% while maintaining rendering quality, enabling faster training and lower memory usage in sparse-view 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods struggle with sparse-view settings due to reliance on SfM for camera poses or generate massive Gaussian counts from MVS models, leading to high memory costs and inefficiency.

Method: Leverages region-based segmentation to identify structurally significant regions, enabling selective downsampling of dense point clouds to preserve scene fidelity while substantially reducing Gaussian count.

Result: Reduces Gaussian count by up to 50%, achieves comparable or superior rendering quality in PSNR and SSIM metrics, with only marginal degradation in LPIPS, while enabling faster training and lower memory footprint.

Conclusion: SDI-GS advances the practicality of 3D Gaussian Splatting for constrained-view scenarios by significantly improving efficiency without compromising rendering quality.

Abstract: Sparse-view synthesis remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of
recovering accurate geometry and appearance from limited observations. While
recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time
rendering with competitive quality, existing pipelines often rely on
Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for camera pose estimation, an approach that
struggles in genuinely sparse-view settings. Moreover, several SfM-free methods
replace SfM with multi-view stereo (MVS) models, but generate massive numbers
of 3D Gaussians by back-projecting every pixel into 3D space, leading to high
memory costs. We propose Segmentation-Driven Initialization for Gaussian
Splatting (SDI-GS), a method that mitigates inefficiency by leveraging
region-based segmentation to identify and retain only structurally significant
regions. This enables selective downsampling of the dense point cloud,
preserving scene fidelity while substantially reducing Gaussian count.
Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that SDI-GS reduces Gaussian count
by up to 50% and achieves comparable or superior rendering quality in PSNR and
SSIM, with only marginal degradation in LPIPS. It further enables faster
training and lower memory footprint, advancing the practicality of 3DGS for
constrained-view scenarios.

Conclusion: Dr.V provides a practical blueprint for robust video understanding in real-world scenarios by systematically addressing hallucination issues through human-like comprehension pipeline.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video models (LVMs) have significantly enhance
video understanding. However, these models continue to suffer from
hallucinations, producing content that conflicts with input videos. To address
this issue, we propose Dr.V, a hierarchical framework covering perceptive,
temporal, and cognitive levels to diagnose video hallucination by fine-grained
spatial-temporal grounding. Dr.V comprises of two key components: a benchmark

10k instances drawn from 4,974 videos spanning diverse tasks, each enriched
with detailed spatial-temporal annotation. Dr.V-Agent detects hallucinations in
LVMs by systematically applying fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding at the
perceptive and temporal levels, followed by cognitive level reasoning. This
step-by-step pipeline mirrors human-like video comprehension and effectively
identifies hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dr.V-Agent is
effective in diagnosing hallucination while enhancing interpretability and
reliability, offering a practical blueprint for robust video understanding in
real-world scenarios. All our data and code are available at

TL;DR: MOT methods outperform traditional MAT tools for long-term pig tracking, showing better accuracy and reliability for livestock monitoring applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precision livestock farming needs advanced monitoring tools. Current multi-animal tracking (MAT) tools underperform compared to state-of-the-art multi-object tracking (MOT) methods, leading to inaccurate behavior analysis and health monitoring.

Method: Benchmarked both MAT tools (DeepLabCut, idTracker) and MOT methods (ByteTrack, DeepSORT, cross-input consistency, Track-Anything, PromptTrack) on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset.

Result: MOT approaches overall outperformed traditional MAT tools, even for long-term tracking scenarios.

Conclusion: Recent MOT techniques have strong potential to enhance accuracy and reliability of automated livestock tracking for precision farming applications.

Abstract: Precision livestock farming requires advanced monitoring tools to meet the
increasing management needs of the industry. Computer vision systems capable of
long-term multi-animal tracking (MAT) are essential for continuous behavioral
monitoring in livestock production. MAT, a specialized subset of multi-object
tracking (MOT), shares many challenges with MOT, but also faces domain-specific
issues including frequent animal occlusion, highly similar appearances among
animals, erratic motion patterns, and a wide range of behavior types.
  While some existing MAT tools are user-friendly and widely adopted, they
often underperform compared to state-of-the-art MOT methods, which can result
in inaccurate downstream tasks such as behavior analysis, health state
estimation, and related applications. In this study, we benchmarked both MAT
and MOT approaches for long-term tracking of pigs. We compared tools such as
DeepLabCut and idTracker with MOT-based methods including ByteTrack, DeepSORT,
cross-input consistency, and newer approaches like Track-Anything and
PromptTrack.
  All methods were evaluated on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset. Our results
demonstrate that, overall, MOT approaches outperform traditional MAT tools,
even for long-term tracking scenarios. These findings highlight the potential
of recent MOT techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated
livestock tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Weighted Prompt Manipulation (WPM) technique for zero-shot image generation from poems, using diffusion models and LLMs to dynamically adjust word importance for better visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poetry invites multiple interpretations based on readers' emotions and backgrounds, so there's a need to generate and modify images for poems that can adapt to different audience requirements.

Method: Introduces Weighted Prompt Manipulation (WPM) that systematically modifies attention weights and text embeddings in diffusion models, using LLMs like GPT with poetry datasets to dynamically adjust word importance.

Result: The approach produces semantically richer and more contextually accurate visualizations of poems by enhancing or suppressing specific word influences in generated images.

Conclusion: This represents the first integration of weighted prompt manipulation for enhancing imagery in poetic language, providing a comprehensive methodology for improved literary image generation.

Abstract: Poetry is an expressive form of art that invites multiple interpretations, as
readers often bring their own emotions, experiences, and cultural backgrounds
into their understanding of a poem. Recognizing this, we aim to generate images
for poems and improve these images in a zero-shot setting, enabling audiences
to modify images as per their requirements. To achieve this, we introduce a
novel Weighted Prompt Manipulation (WPM) technique, which systematically
modifies attention weights and text embeddings within diffusion models. By
dynamically adjusting the importance of specific words, WPM enhances or
suppresses their influence in the final generated image, leading to
semantically richer and more contextually accurate visualizations. Our approach
exploits diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) such as GPT in
conjunction with existing poetry datasets, ensuring a comprehensive and
structured methodology for improved image generation in the literary domain. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at integrating weighted
prompt manipulation for enhancing imagery in poetic language.

TL;DR: SAM-TTT enhances Segment Anything Model for camouflaged object detection by suppressing adverse parameters and reinforcing advantageous ones using reverse parameter configuration and test-time training layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAM-based COD models focus on enhancing favorable features but neglect adverse parameters that impair semantic understanding in downstream tasks.

Method: Proposes Reverse SAM Parameter Configuration Module to mitigate adverse parameters train-free, and T-Visioner Module with Test-Time Training layers to strengthen advantageous parameters.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on various COD benchmarks, significantly improving SAM's semantic understanding.

Conclusion: SAM-TTT sets a new benchmark in camouflaged object detection by simultaneously addressing both adverse and advantageous parameters through innovative train-free configuration and vision-adapted test-time training.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new Segment Anything Model (SAM) that leverages
reverse parameter configuration and test-time training to enhance its
performance on Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), named SAM-TTT. While most
existing SAM-based COD models primarily focus on enhancing SAM by extracting
favorable features and amplifying its advantageous parameters, a crucial gap is
identified: insufficient attention to adverse parameters that impair SAM's
semantic understanding in downstream tasks. To tackle this issue, the Reverse
SAM Parameter Configuration Module is proposed to effectively mitigate the
influence of adverse parameters in a train-free manner by configuring SAM's
parameters. Building on this foundation, the T-Visioner Module is unveiled to
strengthen advantageous parameters by integrating Test-Time Training layers,
originally developed for language tasks, into vision tasks. Test-Time Training
layers represent a new class of sequence modeling layers characterized by
linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. By integrating two modules,
SAM-TTT simultaneously suppresses adverse parameters while reinforcing
advantageous ones, significantly improving SAM's semantic understanding in COD
task. Our experimental results on various COD benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting a new
benchmark in the field. The code will be available at

*Francis Xiatian Zhang,Emile Mackute,Mohammadreza Kasaei,Kevin Dhaliwal,Robert Thomson,Mohsen Khadem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Brea-Depth is a novel framework that integrates airway-specific geometric priors into depth foundation models for more accurate bronchoscopic depth estimation, addressing overfitting to local textures and improving anatomical structure awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current depth foundation models for bronchoscopy lack anatomical awareness, overfitting to local textures rather than capturing global airway structure, especially under ambiguous depth cues and poor lighting conditions.

Method: Proposes Brea-Depth framework with depth-aware CycleGAN to bridge domain gap between real bronchoscopic images and airway geometries, plus airway structure awareness loss to enforce depth consistency within airway lumen while preserving smooth transitions.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on both collected ex vivo human lung dataset and open bronchoscopic dataset, demonstrating superior anatomical depth preservation and more robust 3D airway reconstructions.

Conclusion: Incorporating anatomical priors through Brea-Depth enhances model generalization and yields more accurate bronchoscopic depth estimation, with the proposed Airway Depth Structure Evaluation metric providing better assessment of structural consistency.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation in bronchoscopy can significantly improve
real-time navigation accuracy and enhance the safety of interventions in
complex, branching airways. Recent advances in depth foundation models have
shown promise for endoscopic scenarios, yet these models often lack anatomical
awareness in bronchoscopy, overfitting to local textures rather than capturing
the global airway structure, particularly under ambiguous depth cues and poor
lighting. To address this, we propose Brea-Depth, a novel framework that
integrates airway-specific geometric priors into foundation model adaptation
for bronchoscopic depth estimation. Our method introduces a depth-aware
CycleGAN, refining the translation between real bronchoscopic images and airway
geometries from anatomical data, effectively bridging the domain gap. In
addition, we introduce an airway structure awareness loss to enforce depth
consistency within the airway lumen while preserving smooth transitions and
structural integrity. By incorporating anatomical priors, Brea-Depth enhances
model generalization and yields more robust, accurate 3D airway
reconstructions. To assess anatomical realism, we introduce Airway Depth
Structure Evaluation, a new metric for structural consistency. We validate
BREA-Depth on a collected ex vivo human lung dataset and an open bronchoscopic
dataset, where it outperforms existing methods in anatomical depth
preservation.

*Akito Shinohara,Kohei Fukuda,Hiroaki Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes logit-space mixing technique for improved out-of-distribution detection by smoothing class relationships and enhancing separation between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Outlier Exposure methods struggle to effectively learn class relationships and clearly distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, especially for data close to decision boundaries.

Method: Linear interpolation in logit space to mix in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, with consistency enforcement between logit-space and input-space mixing results.

Result: Reduces abrupt output fluctuations near decision boundaries, creates smoother separation between distributions, and improves performance on fine-grained detection tasks.

Conclusion: Logit-space mixing provides an effective approach for enhancing out-of-distribution detection by leveraging the distinct properties of class-wise distributions in logit space.

Abstract: The ability to detect out-of-distribution data is essential not only for
ensuring robustness against unknown or unexpected input data but also for
improving the generalization performance of the model. Among various
out-of-distribution detection methods, Outlier Exposure and Mixture Outlier
Exposure are promising approaches that enhance out-of-distribution detection
performance by exposing the outlier data during training. However, even with
these sophisticated techniques, it remains challenging for models to learn the
relationships between classes effectively and to distinguish data sampling from
in-distribution and out-of-distribution clearly. Therefore, we focus on the
logit space, where the properties between class-wise distributions are
distinctly separated from those in the input or feature spaces. Specifically,
we propose a linear interpolation technique in the logit space that mixes
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data to facilitate smoothing logits
between classes and improve the out-of-distribution detection performance,
particularly for out-of-distribution data that lie close to the in-distribution
data. Additionally, we enforce consistency between the logits obtained through
mixing in the logit space and those generated via mixing in the input space.
Our experiments demonstrate that our logit-space mixing technique reduces the
abrupt fluctuations in the model outputs near the decision boundaries,
resulting in smoother and more reliable separation between in-distribution and
out-of-distribution data. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a fine-grained out-of-distribution detection task.

Motivation: FER models trained only on pixels fail to generalize across datasets because facial appearance is an indirect and biased proxy for underlying affect. Brain signals provide more direct affective information that can improve model robustness.

Method: Cross-modal distillation framework with teacher trained on EEG topographic maps producing frozen 5x5 V/A prototype grid. Student trained with conventional loss plus Proto-KD (cosine alignment to prototypes) and D-Geo (depression-inspired geometric prior shaping embedding space).

Result: Method improves both within-domain (FERPlus validation) and cross-dataset performance (AffectNet-mini, CK+), with consistent gains attributed to prototypes and D-Geo. 5x5 grid favored over denser grids for stability.

Conclusion: Simple, deployable framework that improves FER robustness without architectural complexity, transferring brain-informed priors to image-only models without requiring EEG signals during deployment.

Abstract: Facial emotion recognition (FER) models trained only on pixels often fail to
generalize across datasets because facial appearance is an indirect and biased
proxy for underlying affect. We present NeuroGaze-Distill, a cross-modal
distillation framework that transfers brain-informed priors into an image-only
FER student via static Valence/Arousal (V/A) prototypes and a
depression-inspired geometric prior (D-Geo). A teacher trained on EEG
topographic maps from DREAMER (with MAHNOB-HCI as unlabeled support) produces a
consolidated 5x5 V/A prototype grid that is frozen and reused; no EEG-face
pairing and no non-visual signals at deployment are required. The student
(ResNet-18/50) is trained on FERPlus with conventional CE/KD and two
lightweight regularizers: (i) Proto-KD (cosine) aligns student features to the
static prototypes; (ii) D-Geo softly shapes the embedding geometry in line with
affective findings often reported in depression research (e.g., anhedonia-like
contraction in high-valence regions). We evaluate both within-domain (FERPlus
validation) and cross-dataset protocols (AffectNet-mini; optional CK+),
reporting standard 8-way scores alongside present-only Macro-F1 and balanced
accuracy to fairly handle label-set mismatch. Ablations attribute consistent
gains to prototypes and D-Geo, and favor 5x5 over denser grids for stability.
The method is simple, deployable, and improves robustness without architectural
complexity.

*Bo Cao,Fan Yu,Mengmeng Feng,SenHao Zhang,Xin Meng,Yue Zhang,Zhen Qian,Jie Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VMD method uses variation inference and multimodal knowledge distillation to leverage radiologists' domain knowledge for automated carotid plaque vulnerability diagnosis from 3D MRI images and radiology reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing carotid plaque vulnerability from 3D MRI images is challenging for both radiologists and conventional 3D vision networks. Clinical practice uses multimodal approaches combining various imaging modalities and domain expertise, suggesting the need for multimodal diagnostic networks.

Method: Variation inference and Multimodal knowledge Distillation (VMD) strategy that harnesses cross-modality prior knowledge from limited image annotations and radiology reports to enhance diagnostic accuracy for unannotated 3D MRI images.

Result: Conducted in-depth experiments on an in-house dataset and verified the effectiveness of the proposed VMD strategy.

Conclusion: The VMD method provides an effective approach to automate carotid plaque vulnerability diagnosis by leveraging radiologists' domain knowledge through multimodal learning and knowledge distillation techniques.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has attracted much attention in recent years due to its
ability to effectively utilize data features from a variety of different
modalities. Diagnosing the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques directly
from carotid 3D MRI images is relatively challenging for both radiologists and
conventional 3D vision networks. In clinical practice, radiologists assess
patient conditions using a multimodal approach that incorporates various
imaging modalities and domain-specific expertise, paving the way for the
creation of multimodal diagnostic networks. In this paper, we have developed an
effective strategy to leverage radiologists' domain knowledge to automate the
diagnosis of carotid plaque vulnerability through Variation inference and
Multimodal knowledge Distillation (VMD). This method excels in harnessing
cross-modality prior knowledge from limited image annotations and radiology
reports within training data, thereby enhancing the diagnostic network's
accuracy for unannotated 3D MRI images. We conducted in-depth experiments on
the dataset collected in-house and verified the effectiveness of the VMD
strategy we proposed.

*Xue Zhang,Bingshuo Hu,Gene Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel neural network initialization method using graph theory and Douglas-Rachford iterations for image interpolation, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional DNNs use random initialization and SGD optimization, which risks poor local minima. The authors aim to develop a more reliable initialization and optimization approach for image interpolation.

Method: Leverage a theorem mapping linear interpolators to directed graph filters, initialize graph adjacency matrix from known interpolator, learn perturbation matrices from data, and implement restoration via unrolled Douglas-Rachford iterations into an interpretable neural net.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art image interpolation performance while drastically reducing the number of network parameters compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective alternative to random initialization and SGD, offering better performance with fewer parameters through graph-based initialization and unrolled optimization iterations.

Abstract: Conventional deep neural nets (DNNs) initialize network parameters at random
and then optimize each one via stochastic gradient descent (SGD), resulting in
substantial risk of poor-performing local minima.Focusing on the image
interpolation problem and leveraging a recent theorem that maps a
(pseudo-)linear interpolator {\Theta} to a directed graph filter that is a
solution to a MAP problem regularized with a graph shift variation (GSV) prior,
we first initialize a directed graph adjacency matrix A based on a known
interpolator {\Theta}, establishing a baseline performance.Then, towards
further gain, we learn perturbation matrices P and P(2) from data to augment A,
whose restoration effects are implemented via Douglas-Rachford (DR) iterations,
which we unroll into a lightweight interpretable neural net.Experimental
results demonstrate state-of-the-art image interpolation results, while
drastically reducing network parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of immersive applications requires new approaches for processing 360° content. While saliency estimation is well-established for 2D content, there are few effective methods for 360° video saliency detection, which is crucial for optimizing transmission and processing.

Method: The paper introduces Sphere-GAN, a Generative Adversarial Network that employs spherical convolutions specifically designed for 360° video content to detect visually relevant areas.

Result: Extensive experiments on a public 360° video saliency dataset show that Sphere-GAN achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models in accurately predicting saliency maps.

Conclusion: Sphere-GAN represents an effective solution for 360° video saliency estimation, demonstrating the value of using GANs with spherical convolutions for immersive content analysis and optimization.

Abstract: The recent success of immersive applications is pushing the research
community to define new approaches to process 360{\deg} images and videos and
optimize their transmission. Among these, saliency estimation provides a
powerful tool that can be used to identify visually relevant areas and,
consequently, adapt processing algorithms. Although saliency estimation has
been widely investigated for 2D content, very few algorithms have been proposed
for 360{\deg} saliency estimation. Towards this goal, we introduce Sphere-GAN,
a saliency detection model for 360{\deg} videos that leverages a Generative
Adversarial Network with spherical convolutions. Extensive experiments were
conducted using a public 360{\deg} video saliency dataset, and the results
demonstrate that Sphere-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in accurately
predicting saliency maps.

TL;DR: Proposed CLAIRE - a dual encoder architecture with cross-modality attention fusion for land cover classification using optical and SAR imagery, addressing class imbalance with RIFT loss function and adding interpretability through language model explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Land cover classification from satellite imagery faces challenges due to complex natural landscapes, visual similarity between classes, and significant class imbalance in datasets, requiring better fusion of multi-modal data and handling of underrepresented categories.

Method: Dual encoder architecture independently extracts features from optical and SAR imagery, fused using cross-modality attention module (CLAIRE). Uses hybrid RIFT loss (Weighted Focal + Tversky Loss) for class imbalance. Includes metric-driven reasoning module with Small Language Model (Phi-3) for explanations.

Result: Achieved mIoU of 56.02% and OA of 84.56% on WHU-OPT-SAR; mIoU 59.89% and OA 73.92% on OpenEarthMap-SAR; mIoU 86.86% and OA 94.58% on PIE-RGB-SAR under cloud-obstructed conditions. Demonstrated strong generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed CLAIRE architecture effectively addresses land cover classification challenges by leveraging complementary multi-modal features, handling class imbalance, and providing interpretable explanations through language model integration, achieving competitive performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate land cover classification from satellite imagery is crucial in
environmental monitoring and sustainable resource management. However, it
remains challenging due to the complexity of natural landscapes, the visual
similarity between classes, and the significant class imbalance in the
available datasets. To address these issues, we propose a dual encoder
architecture that independently extracts modality-specific features from
optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, which are then fused using
a cross-modality attention-fusion module named Cross-modality Land cover
segmentation with Attention and Imbalance-aware Reasoning-Enhanced Explanations
(CLAIRE). This fusion mechanism highlights complementary spatial and textural
features, enabling the network to better capture detailed and diverse land
cover patterns. We incorporate a hybrid loss function that utilizes Weighted
Focal Loss and Tversky Loss named RIFT (Rare-Instance Focal-Tversky) to address
class imbalance and improve segmentation performance across underrepresented
categories. Our model achieves competitive performance across multiple
benchmarks: a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 56.02% and Overall
Accuracy (OA) of 84.56% on the WHU-OPT-SAR dataset; strong generalization with
a mIoU of 59.89% and OA of 73.92% on the OpenEarthMap-SAR dataset; and
remarkable robustness under cloud-obstructed conditions, achieving an mIoU of
86.86% and OA of 94.58% on the PIE-RGB-SAR dataset. Additionally, we introduce
a metric-driven reasoning module generated by a Small Language Model (Phi-3),
which generates expert-level, sample-specific justifications for model
predictions, thereby enhancing transparency and interpretability.

Motivation: LiDAR generation remains underexplored despite its importance for accurate 3D perception, and extending generation to 4D LiDAR data introduces challenges in controllability, temporal stability, and evaluation.

Method: Parses instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, uses tri-branch diffusion model for object layouts/trajectories/shapes, range-image diffusion for initial scan, and autoregressive module for temporal coherence. Supports object-level editing.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency on nuScenes dataset. Provides EvalSuite benchmark for comprehensive evaluation.

Conclusion: LiDARCrafter offers a foundation for LiDAR-based simulation and data augmentation, addressing key challenges in 4D LiDAR generation with strong performance across multiple metrics.

Abstract: While generative world models have advanced video and occupancy-based data
synthesis, LiDAR generation remains underexplored despite its importance for
accurate 3D perception. Extending generation to 4D LiDAR data introduces
challenges in controllability, temporal stability, and evaluation. We present
LiDARCrafter, a unified framework that converts free-form language into
editable LiDAR sequences. Instructions are parsed into ego-centric scene
graphs, which a tri-branch diffusion model transforms into object layouts,
trajectories, and shapes. A range-image diffusion model generates the initial
scan, and an autoregressive module extends it into a temporally coherent
sequence. The explicit layout design further supports object-level editing,
such as insertion or relocation. To enable fair assessment, we provide
EvalSuite, a benchmark spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level metrics. On
nuScenes, LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency, offering a foundation for LiDAR-based simulation and data

*Zixuan Fu,Yan Ren,Finn Carter,Chenyue Wen,Le Ku,Daheng Yu,Emily Davis,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCORE is a novel framework for robust concept removal in diffusion models that formulates erasure as an adversarial independence problem, providing theoretical guarantees and outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 12.5% in erasure efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models pose increasing risks in privacy, fairness, and security, creating a growing demand to erase sensitive or harmful concepts (NSFW content, private individuals, artistic styles) while preserving overall generative capabilities.

Method: SCORE formulates concept erasure as an adversarial independence problem, minimizing mutual information between target concepts and generated outputs. It integrates adversarial optimization, trajectory consistency, and saliency-driven fine-tuning to provide provable erasure guarantees.

Result: SCORE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods (EraseAnything, ANT, MACE, ESD, UCE) across four benchmarks: object erasure, NSFW removal, celebrity face suppression, and artistic style unlearning, achieving up to 12.5% higher erasure efficacy while maintaining comparable or superior image quality.

Conclusion: SCORE sets a new standard for secure and robust concept erasure in diffusion models by providing theoretical convergence guarantees, formal upper bounds on residual concept leakage, and superior empirical performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation but
pose increasing risks in terms of privacy, fairness, and security. A growing
demand exists to \emph{erase} sensitive or harmful concepts (e.g., NSFW
content, private individuals, artistic styles) from these models while
preserving their overall generative capabilities. We introduce \textbf{SCORE}
(Secure and Concept-Oriented Robust Erasure), a novel framework for robust
concept removal in diffusion models. SCORE formulates concept erasure as an
\emph{adversarial independence} problem, theoretically guaranteeing that the
model's outputs become statistically independent of the erased concept. Unlike
prior heuristic methods, SCORE minimizes the mutual information between a
target concept and generated outputs, yielding provable erasure guarantees. We
provide formal proofs establishing convergence properties and derive upper
bounds on residual concept leakage. Empirically, we evaluate SCORE on Stable
Diffusion and FLUX across four challenging benchmarks: object erasure, NSFW
removal, celebrity face suppression, and artistic style unlearning. SCORE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods including EraseAnything, ANT,
MACE, ESD, and UCE, achieving up to \textbf{12.5\%} higher erasure efficacy
while maintaining comparable or superior image quality. By integrating
adversarial optimization, trajectory consistency, and saliency-driven
fine-tuning, SCORE sets a new standard for secure and robust concept erasure in
diffusion models.

*Zilong Zhang,Chujie Qin,Chunle Guo,Yong Zhang,Chao Xue,Ming-Ming Cheng,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAM++ is a two-stage framework for all-in-one image restoration that integrates semantic understanding with texture generation, achieving robust performance across various degradation types through adaptive masking and feature regularization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing degradation-oriented methods struggle with extreme scenarios where degradations are strongly coupled with image structures, and face challenges like unbalanced performance across tasks, overfitting to seen degradations, and weak generalization to unseen ones.

Method: RAM++ uses three key designs: 1) Adaptive Semantic-Aware Mask (AdaSAM) for pretraining with pixel-level masks on semantically rich regions, 2) Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC) for selective fine-tuning of high-contribution layers, and 3) Robust Feature Regularization (RFR) leveraging DINOv2's degradation-invariant representations with efficient feature fusion.

Result: RAM++ achieves robust, well-balanced, and state-of-the-art performance across seen, unseen, extreme, and mixed degradations in image restoration tasks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates high-level semantic understanding with low-level texture generation, providing content-oriented robust restoration that addresses limitations of existing degradation-oriented approaches.

Abstract: This work presents Robust Representation Learning via Adaptive Mask (RAM++),
a two-stage framework for all-in-one image restoration. RAM++ integrates
high-level semantic understanding with low-level texture generation to achieve
content-oriented robust restoration. It addresses the limitations of existing
degradation-oriented methods in extreme scenarios (e.g., degradations strongly
coupled with image structures). RAM++ also mitigates common challenges such as
unbalanced performance across tasks, overfitting to seen degradations, and weak
generalization to unseen ones through three key designs: 1) Adaptive
Semantic-Aware Mask (AdaSAM): a pretraining strategy that applies pixel-level
masks to semantically rich and textured regions. This design enables the
network to learn both generative priors and image content priors from various
degradations. 2) Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC): a selective fine-tuning
strategy that adjusts the layers with higher contributions to bridge the
integrity gap between masked pretraining and full-image fine-tuning while
retaining learned priors. 3) Robust Feature Regularization (RFR): a strategy
that leverages DINOv2's semantically consistent and degradation-invariant
representations, together with efficient feature fusion, to achieve faithful
and semantically coherent restoration. With these designs, RAM++ achieves
robust, well-balanced, and state-of-the-art performance across seen, unseen,
extreme, and mixed degradations. Our code and model will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarSync is an autoregressive framework that generates realistic talking-head animations from a single image using text/audio input, addressing flicker and identity drift issues through a two-stage phoneme-based approach with improved temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GAN and diffusion-based talking-head animation methods suffer from inter-frame flicker, identity drift, and slow inference speeds, limiting their practical applications.

Method: Two-stage autoregressive framework: 1) Facial Keyframe Generation using phoneme representations with Text-Frame Causal Attention Mask, 2) Inter-frame interpolation with timestamp-aware adaptive strategy based on selective state space model for bidirectional context reasoning.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in visual fidelity, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency with reduced latency while maintaining visual quality.

Conclusion: AvatarSync provides a scalable and controllable solution for realistic talking-head animation that addresses key limitations of previous approaches through its phoneme-based autoregressive framework and optimized inference pipeline.

Abstract: Existing talking-head animation approaches based on Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) or diffusion models often suffer from inter-frame flicker,
identity drift, and slow inference. These limitations inherent to their video
generation pipelines restrict their suitability for applications. To address
this, we introduce AvatarSync, an autoregressive framework on phoneme
representations that generates realistic and controllable talking-head
animations from a single reference image, driven directly text or audio input.
In addition, AvatarSync adopts a two-stage generation strategy, decoupling
semantic modeling from visual dynamics, which is a deliberate "Divide and
Conquer" design. The first stage, Facial Keyframe Generation (FKG), focuses on
phoneme-level semantic representation by leveraging the many-to-one mapping
from text or audio to phonemes. A Phoneme-to-Visual Mapping is constructed to
anchor abstract phonemes to character-level units. Combined with a customized
Text-Frame Causal Attention Mask, the keyframes are generated. The second
stage, inter-frame interpolation, emphasizes temporal coherence and visual
smoothness. We introduce a timestamp-aware adaptive strategy based on a
selective state space model, enabling efficient bidirectional context
reasoning. To support deployment, we optimize the inference pipeline to reduce
latency without compromising visual fidelity. Extensive experiments show that
AvatarSync outperforms existing talking-head animation methods in visual
fidelity, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency, providing a
scalable and controllable solution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cross-population data augmentation framework that enables fetal pose estimation models to generalize to younger gestational ages using only annotated data from older gestational age cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fetal motion quantification is challenging at early gestational ages due to anatomical changes and lack of annotated data. Current methods fail to generalize to early GAs.

Method: Developed a fetal-specific augmentation strategy that simulates the intrauterine environment and fetal positioning of early GAs using only annotated images from older GA cohorts.

Result: Cross-population augmentation yields reduced variability and significant improvements across both older GA and challenging early GA cases.

Conclusion: Enables more reliable pose estimation across gestation, facilitating early clinical detection and intervention in 4D fetal imaging.

Abstract: Fetal motion is a critical indicator of neurological development and
intrauterine health, yet its quantification remains challenging, particularly
at earlier gestational ages (GA). Current methods track fetal motion by
predicting the location of annotated landmarks on 3D echo planar imaging (EPI)
time-series, primarily in third-trimester fetuses. The predicted landmarks
enable simplification of the fetal body for downstream analysis. While these
methods perform well within their training age distribution, they consistently
fail to generalize to early GAs due to significant anatomical changes in both
mother and fetus across gestation, as well as the difficulty of obtaining
annotated early GA EPI data. In this work, we develop a cross-population data
augmentation framework that enables pose estimation models to robustly
generalize to younger GA clinical cohorts using only annotated images from
older GA cohorts. Specifically, we introduce a fetal-specific augmentation
strategy that simulates the distinct intrauterine environment and fetal
positioning of early GAs. Our experiments find that cross-population
augmentation yields reduced variability and significant improvements across
both older GA and challenging early GA cases. By enabling more reliable pose
estimation across gestation, our work potentially facilitates early clinical
detection and intervention in challenging 4D fetal imaging settings. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImplMORe is an end-to-end deep learning method using implicit surface representations for multi-organ reconstruction from 3D medical images, outperforming discrete explicit representation approaches by providing higher resolution surface details than the input image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained surface reconstruction of organs from 3D medical imaging provides advanced diagnostic support and surgical planning, but traditional methods are limited by resolution constraints and high memory/computing requirements. Implicit representations offer compact solutions but cannot be directly applied to medical images due to architectural and data-related differences.

Method: ImplMORe uses a 3D CNN encoder to incorporate local features and performs multi-scale interpolation to learn features in the continuous domain using occupancy functions. The method is applied for single and multiple organ reconstructions using the totalsegmentator dataset.

Result: The approach outperforms discrete explicit representation based surface reconstruction methods by leveraging the continuous nature of occupancy functions, providing fine-grained surface details of organs at a resolution higher than the given input image.

Conclusion: ImplMORe successfully addresses the limitations of traditional medical image reconstruction by adapting implicit surface representations to medical imaging, enabling higher resolution organ reconstruction with better detail preservation than previous approaches.

Abstract: The fine-grained surface reconstruction of different organs from 3D medical
imaging can provide advanced diagnostic support and improved surgical planning.
However, the representation of the organs is often limited by the resolution,
with a detailed higher resolution requiring more memory and computing
footprint. Implicit representations of objects have been proposed to alleviate
this problem in general computer vision by providing compact and differentiable
functions to represent the 3D object shapes. However, architectural and
data-related differences prevent the direct application of these methods to
medical images. This work introduces ImplMORe, an end-to-end deep learning
method using implicit surface representations for multi-organ reconstruction
from 3D medical images. ImplMORe incorporates local features using a 3D CNN
encoder and performs multi-scale interpolation to learn the features in the
continuous domain using occupancy functions. We apply our method for single and
multiple organ reconstructions using the totalsegmentator dataset. By
leveraging the continuous nature of occupancy functions, our approach
outperforms the discrete explicit representation based surface reconstruction
approaches, providing fine-grained surface details of the organ at a resolution
higher than the given input image. The source code will be made publicly

TL;DR: A novel trajectory-controllable unfolding framework for CASSI that ensures smooth optimization paths from noisy estimates to high-quality hyperspectral reconstructions, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep unfolding networks for CASSI reconstruction suffer from uncontrollable trajectories causing abrupt quality jumps and non-gradual refinement across stages.

Method: Proposes trajectory-controllable unfolding framework inspired by diffusion trajectories and flow matching, with efficient spatial-spectral Transformer and frequency-domain fusion module for feature consistency.

Result: Achieves better reconstruction quality and efficiency than prior state-of-the-art approaches on both simulation and real data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses trajectory control issues in CASSI reconstruction, delivering superior performance through smooth optimization paths and efficient architectural design.

Abstract: Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) retrieves a 3D hyperspectral
image (HSI) from a single 2D compressed measurement, which is a highly
challenging reconstruction task. Recent deep unfolding networks (DUNs),
empowered by explicit data-fidelity updates and implicit deep denoisers, have
achieved the state of the art in CASSI reconstruction. However, existing
unfolding approaches suffer from uncontrollable reconstruction trajectories,
leading to abrupt quality jumps and non-gradual refinement across stages.
Inspired by diffusion trajectories and flow matching, we propose a novel
trajectory-controllable unfolding framework that enforces smooth, continuous
optimization paths from noisy initial estimates to high-quality
reconstructions. To achieve computational efficiency, we design an efficient
spatial-spectral Transformer tailored for hyperspectral reconstruction, along
with a frequency-domain fusion module to gurantee feature consistency.
Experiments on simulation and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
better reconstruction quality and efficiency than prior state-of-the-art
approaches.

TL;DR: TetHeart is an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 4D cardiac motion from both complete CMR stacks and sparse intra-procedural slices using deep deformable tetrahedra representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cardiac motion reconstruction methods require complete CMR stacks, limiting their utility in intra-procedural scenarios where only sparse slice observations are available.

Method: Uses deep deformable tetrahedra (explicit-implicit hybrid representation) with attentive slice-adaptive 2D-3D feature assembly and two-stage weakly supervised motion learning requiring only keyframe annotations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization on three large public datasets and external evaluation on private interventional datasets in both pre- and intra-procedural settings.

Conclusion: TetHeart enables unified 4D heart mesh recovery from both full-stack and sparse-slice observations, making it suitable for both offline analysis and intra-procedural applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing cardiac motion from cine CMR sequences is critical for
diagnosis, prediction, and intervention. Existing methods rely on complete CMR
stacks to infer full heart motion, limiting their utility in intra-procedural
scenarios where only sparse observations are available. We present TetHeart,
the first end-to-end framework that unifies full 4D multi-structure heart mesh
recovery from both offline full-stack acquisitions and intra-procedural
sparse-slice observations. Our method leverages deep deformable tetrahedra, an
explicit-implicit hybrid representation, to capture shape and motion in a
coherent space shared across cardiac structures. It is initialized from
high-quality pre-procedural or offline-acquired full stacks to build detailed,
patient-specific heart meshes, which can then be updated using whatever slices
are available, from full stacks down to a single slice. We further incorporate
several key innovations: (i) an attentive mechanism for slice-adaptive 2D-3D
feature assembly that dynamically integrates information from arbitrary numbers
of slices at any position, combined with a distillation strategy from
full-slice to sparse-slice settings to ensure accurate reconstruction under
extreme sparsity; and (ii) a two-stage weakly supervised motion learning scheme
requiring only keyframe (e.g., ED and ES) annotations. Trained and validated on
three large public datasets and externally evaluated zero-shot on additional
private interventional and public CMR datasets, TetHeart achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization in both pre- and
intra-procedural settings.

Result: Achieves remarkable results on PASCAL-5i, COCO-20i and FSS-1000 datasets with excellent computational efficiency during inference.

Conclusion: FS-SAM2 effectively adapts SAM2 for few-shot segmentation with minimal parameter updates, demonstrating strong performance and efficiency across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation has recently attracted great attention. The
goal is to develop a model capable of segmenting unseen classes using only a
few annotated samples. Most existing approaches adapt a pre-trained model by
training from scratch an additional module. Achieving optimal performance with
these approaches requires extensive training on large-scale datasets. The
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) is a foundational model for zero-shot image and
video segmentation with a modular design. In this paper, we propose a Few-Shot
segmentation method based on SAM2 (FS-SAM2), where SAM2's video capabilities
are directly repurposed for the few-shot task. Moreover, we apply a Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) to the original modules in order to handle the diverse images
typically found in standard datasets, unlike the temporally connected frames
used in SAM2's pre-training. With this approach, only a small number of
parameters is meta-trained, which effectively adapts SAM2 while benefiting from
its impressive segmentation performance. Our method supports any K-shot
configuration. We evaluate FS-SAM2 on the PASCAL-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$ and
FSS-1000 datasets, achieving remarkable results and demonstrating excellent
computational efficiency during inference. Code is available at

### [137] [RailSafeNet: Visual Scene Understanding for Tram Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12125)
*Ing. Ondrej Valach,Ing. Ivan Gruber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RailSafeNet is a real-time AI framework that uses monocular video to detect track intrusions and assess collision risks by combining semantic segmentation, object detection, and distance analysis with rail gauge standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tram-human interaction safety is critical as trams operate in dense urban areas where collisions can cause serious injuries or fatalities. The paper aims to improve safety for pedestrians, drivers, cyclists, pets, and tram passengers through AI-powered detection.

Method: The RailSafeNet framework fuses semantic segmentation (SegFormer B3 model) for rail detection, object detection (YOLOv8) for nearby object localization, and a rule-based Distance Assessor that compares projected distances with the standard 1435mm rail gauge to classify risk levels.

Result: On the RailSem19 dataset, the system achieved 65% IoU for rail segmentation and 75.6% mAP for object detection at IoU threshold 0.50, demonstrating accurate real-time scene understanding with minimal annotation requirements.

Conclusion: RailSafeNet provides an effective annotation-light solution for real-time track intrusion detection and risk assessment, enabling early warnings to tram drivers before dangerous situations escalate, thereby improving urban tram safety.

Abstract: Tram-human interaction safety is an important challenge, given that trams
frequently operate in densely populated areas, where collisions can range from
minor injuries to fatal outcomes. This paper addresses the issue from the
perspective of designing a solution leveraging digital image processing, deep
learning, and artificial intelligence to improve the safety of pedestrians,
drivers, cyclists, pets, and tram passengers. We present RailSafeNet, a
real-time framework that fuses semantic segmentation, object detection and a
rule-based Distance Assessor to highlight track intrusions. Using only
monocular video, the system identifies rails, localises nearby objects and
classifies their risk by comparing projected distances with the standard 1435mm
rail gauge. Experiments on the diverse RailSem19 dataset show that a
class-filtered SegFormer B3 model achieves 65% intersection-over-union (IoU),
while a fine-tuned YOLOv8 attains 75.6% mean average precision (mAP) calculated
at an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.50. RailSafeNet therefore
delivers accurate, annotation-light scene understanding that can warn drivers
before dangerous situations escalate. Code available at

TL;DR: OpenHOUSE system combines online action localization with hierarchical event grouping and free-form description generation, significantly improving streaming video understanding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of datasets with hierarchical temporal annotations and extend streaming action perception beyond simple classification to include event grouping and description generation.

Method: Uses LLMs to group atomic actions into higher-level events, and proposes OpenHOUSE with a specialized streaming module for accurate boundary detection between adjacent actions.

Result: The method nearly doubles performance compared to direct extensions of existing methods for detecting boundaries between closely adjacent actions.

Conclusion: OpenHOUSE represents a key step toward integrating powerful generative models for streaming action perception, enabling hierarchical online video understanding with free-form descriptions.

Abstract: We introduce Hierarchical Streaming Video Understanding, a task that combines
online temporal action localization with free-form description generation.
Given the scarcity of datasets with hierarchical and fine-grained temporal
annotations, we demonstrate that LLMs can effectively group atomic actions into
higher-level events, enriching existing datasets. We then propose OpenHOUSE
(Open-ended Hierarchical Online Understanding System for Events), which extends
streaming action perception beyond action classification. OpenHOUSE features a
specialized streaming module that accurately detects boundaries between closely
adjacent actions, nearly doubling the performance of direct extensions of
existing methods. We envision the future of streaming action perception in the
integration of powerful generative models, with OpenHOUSE representing a key
step in that direction.

TL;DR: LoRA fine-tuning for vision models (DinoV2, SwinV2) achieves comparable/superior performance to full fine-tuning for RILI diagnosis from CT scans, with significantly reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the efficiency and robustness of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning large vision models to diagnose Radiation-Induced Lung Injury from CT scans, comparing it with traditional methods.

Method: Used LoRA fine-tuning on DinoV2 and SwinV2 models with cropped CT images (50mm3 and 75mm3) centered at treatment isocenter, comparing against full fine-tuning and inference-only approaches with different 2D-to-3D adaptation techniques.

Result: LoRA achieved comparable or superior performance to traditional fine-tuning while significantly reducing computational costs and training times by requiring fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: LoRA is an efficient and effective alternative to traditional full fine-tuning for adapting large vision models to medical imaging tasks like RILI diagnosis, offering performance benefits with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for
fine-tuning large Vision Models, DinoV2 and SwinV2, to diagnose
Radiation-Induced Lung Injury (RILI) from X-ray CT scans following Stereotactic
Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). To evaluate the robustness and efficiency of
this approach, we compare LoRA with traditional full fine-tuning and
inference-only (no fine-tuning) methods. Cropped images of two sizes (50 mm3
and 75 mm3), centered at the treatment isocenter, in addition to different
adaptation techniques for adapting the 2D LVMs for 3D data were used to
determine the sensitivity of the models to spatial context. Experimental
results show that LoRA achieves comparable or superior performance to
traditional fine-tuning while significantly reducing computational costs and
training times by requiring fewer trainable parameters.

TL;DR: Self-supervised learning with domain-adaptive pretraining significantly improves action recognition for primate behavior analysis, outperforming state-of-the-art methods without requiring labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer vision for animal behavior research faces high labeling costs as a bottleneck for large-scale datasets. There's a need for data-efficient learning approaches to support ecology, cognition research, and conservation efforts.

Method: Utilized self-supervised learning with a pretrained V-JEPA model and applied domain-adaptive pretraining (DAP) by continuing pretraining with in-domain primate behavior data. The approach doesn't require labeled samples.

Result: Outperformed published state-of-the-art action recognition models by 6.1% accuracy on PanAf dataset and 6.3% mAP on ChimpACT dataset. Most performance gains came from the domain-adaptive pretraining component.

Conclusion: The method shows great potential for improving animal behavior recognition since DAP doesn't require labeled samples, making it highly scalable for large-scale wildlife monitoring and research applications.

Abstract: Computer vision for animal behavior offers promising tools to aid research in
ecology, cognition, and to support conservation efforts. Video camera traps
allow for large-scale data collection, but high labeling costs remain a
bottleneck to creating large-scale datasets. We thus need data-efficient
learning approaches. In this work, we show that we can utilize self-supervised
learning to considerably improve action recognition on primate behavior. On two
datasets of great ape behavior (PanAf and ChimpACT), we outperform published
state-of-the-art action recognition models by 6.1 %pt. accuracy and 6.3 %pt.
mAP, respectively. We achieve this by utilizing a pretrained V-JEPA model and
applying domain-adaptive pretraining (DAP), i.e. continuing the pretraining
with in-domain data. We show that most of the performance gain stems from the
DAP. Our method promises great potential for improving the recognition of
animal behavior, as DAP does not require labeled samples. Code is available at

TL;DR: OmniWorld is a large-scale multi-domain dataset for 4D world modeling that addresses data limitations in current benchmarks, enabling better 4D reconstruction and video generation through richer modality coverage and realistic dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 4D world modeling is constrained by limited data availability - existing datasets lack dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and proper spatiotemporal annotations needed for tasks like 4D reconstruction and future prediction.

Method: Introduces OmniWorld dataset consisting of newly collected OmniWorld-Game data and curated public datasets across diverse domains, providing richer modality coverage and more realistic dynamic interactions than existing synthetic datasets.

Result: Fine-tuning state-of-the-art methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, and the benchmark exposes limitations of current approaches in modeling complex 4D environments.

Conclusion: OmniWorld serves as a powerful resource for training and evaluation that will accelerate development of general-purpose 4D world models and advance machines' holistic understanding of the physical world.

Abstract: The field of 4D world modeling - aiming to jointly capture spatial geometry
and temporal dynamics - has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years,
driven by advances in large-scale generative models and multimodal learning.
However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally
constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and
benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and
spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric
reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To
address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain,
multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld
consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public
datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets,
OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more
realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a
challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning
existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains
across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating
OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision
OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D
world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the
physical world.

*Zixin Yin,Xili Dai,Duomin Wang,Xianfang Zeng,Lionel M. Ni,Gang Yu,Heung-Yeung Shum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LazyDrag is a novel drag-based image editing method that eliminates implicit point matching through explicit correspondence maps, enabling stable full-strength inversion without test-time optimization while unifying precise geometric control with text guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing drag-based editing methods rely on implicit point matching via attention, which compromises inversion strength and requires costly test-time optimization, limiting diffusion models' generative capabilities for high-fidelity inpainting and text-guided creation.

Method: Generates explicit correspondence maps from user drag inputs as reliable references to boost attention control, enabling stable full-strength inversion process without test-time optimization. Supports multi-round workflows with simultaneous move and scale operations.

Result: Outperforms baselines in drag accuracy and perceptual quality on DragBench, validated by VIEScore and human evaluation. Enables complex edits like opening mouths, generating new objects, and context-aware changes for ambiguous drags.

Conclusion: LazyDrag establishes new state-of-the-art performance and paves a new way for editing paradigms by directly eliminating implicit point matching reliance and unlocking the full generative capability of diffusion models.

Abstract: The reliance on implicit point matching via attention has become a core
bottleneck in drag-based editing, resulting in a fundamental compromise on
weakened inversion strength and costly test-time optimization (TTO). This
compromise severely limits the generative capabilities of diffusion models,
suppressing high-fidelity inpainting and text-guided creation. In this paper,
we introduce LazyDrag, the first drag-based image editing method for
Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers, which directly eliminates the reliance on
implicit point matching. In concrete terms, our method generates an explicit
correspondence map from user drag inputs as a reliable reference to boost the
attention control. This reliable reference opens the potential for a stable
full-strength inversion process, which is the first in the drag-based editing
task. It obviates the necessity for TTO and unlocks the generative capability
of models. Therefore, LazyDrag naturally unifies precise geometric control with
text guidance, enabling complex edits that were previously out of reach:
opening the mouth of a dog and inpainting its interior, generating new objects
like a ``tennis ball'', or for ambiguous drags, making context-aware changes
like moving a hand into a pocket. Additionally, LazyDrag supports multi-round
workflows with simultaneous move and scale operations. Evaluated on the
DragBench, our method outperforms baselines in drag accuracy and perceptual
quality, as validated by VIEScore and human evaluation. LazyDrag not only
establishes new state-of-the-art performance, but also paves a new way to
editing paradigms.

TL;DR: Audio-visual pipeline for animated character recognition using online-sourced character banks, enabling accessibility applications like audio descriptions and character-aware subtitling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Animated characters pose challenges for conventional recognition systems due to extreme diversity in appearance, motion, and deformation, requiring new approaches for character-centric understanding.

Method: Automatic construction of audio-visual character bank from online sources containing visual exemplars and voice samples, enabling multi-modal character recognition despite long-tailed appearance distributions.

Result: Significant improvements in accessibility and narrative comprehension for animated content over prior face-detection-based approaches, with new CMD-AM dataset of 75 animated movies.

Conclusion: The audio-visual pipeline enables robust animated character recognition and supports downstream accessibility applications, advancing character-centric understanding of animated movies.

Abstract: Animated movies are captivating for their unique character designs and
imaginative storytelling, yet they pose significant challenges for existing
recognition systems. Unlike the consistent visual patterns detected by
conventional face recognition methods, animated characters exhibit extreme
diversity in their appearance, motion, and deformation. In this work, we
propose an audio-visual pipeline to enable automatic and robust animated
character recognition, and thereby enhance character-centric understanding of
animated movies. Central to our approach is the automatic construction of an
audio-visual character bank from online sources. This bank contains both visual
exemplars and voice (audio) samples for each character, enabling subsequent
multi-modal character recognition despite long-tailed appearance distributions.
Building on accurate character recognition, we explore two downstream
applications: Audio Description (AD) generation for visually impaired
audiences, and character-aware subtitling for the hearing impaired. To support
research in this domain, we introduce CMD-AM, a new dataset of 75 animated
movies with comprehensive annotations. Our character-centric pipeline
demonstrates significant improvements in both accessibility and narrative
comprehension for animated content over prior face-detection-based approaches.

*Gang Cheng,Haibo Jin,Wenbin Zhang,Haohan Wang,Jun Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Risk-Concealment Attacks (RCA), a multi-turn framework that successfully bypasses financial LLM safety measures by concealing regulatory risks, achieving 93.18% average attack success rate on mainstream models including GPT-4.1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing red-teaming research focuses on harmful content but neglects regulatory risks in financial LLMs, creating a critical gap in safety evaluation for financial applications.

Method: Developed Risk-Concealment Attacks (RCA) - a multi-turn framework that iteratively conceals regulatory risks to provoke regulatory-violating responses. Created FIN-Bench, a domain-specific benchmark for systematic evaluation of LLM safety in financial contexts.

Result: RCA achieved 93.18% average attack success rate across nine mainstream LLMs, including 98.28% on GPT-4.1 and 97.56% on OpenAI o1, demonstrating severe vulnerabilities in current financial LLM safety measures.

Conclusion: Reveals critical gaps in current alignment techniques and underscores urgent need for stronger moderation mechanisms in financial domains. Provides practical insights for advancing robust, domain-aware LLM alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into financial
applications, yet existing red-teaming research primarily targets harmful
content, largely neglecting regulatory risks. In this work, we aim to
investigate the vulnerability of financial LLMs through red-teaming approaches.
We introduce Risk-Concealment Attacks (RCA), a novel multi-turn framework that
iteratively conceals regulatory risks to provoke seemingly compliant yet
regulatory-violating responses from LLMs. To enable systematic evaluation, we
construct FIN-Bench, a domain-specific benchmark for assessing LLM safety in
financial contexts. Extensive experiments on FIN-Bench demonstrate that RCA
effectively bypasses nine mainstream LLMs, achieving an average attack success
rate (ASR) of 93.18%, including 98.28% on GPT-4.1 and 97.56% on OpenAI o1.
These findings reveal a critical gap in current alignment techniques and
underscore the urgent need for stronger moderation mechanisms in financial
domains. We hope this work offers practical insights for advancing robust and
domain-aware LLM alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can internally predict answer correctness before generating responses using linear probes on activations, with predictive power emerging in intermediate layers and generalizing across domains except mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLMs can internally anticipate when their answers will be correct before generating them, and to study the emergence of self-assessment capabilities during computation.

Method: Extract activations after question reading but before token generation, train linear probes to predict forthcoming answer correctness across three open-source model families (7-70B parameters), test generalization on diverse knowledge datasets.

Result: Linear probes trained on trivia questions successfully predict correctness in-distribution and out-of-distribution, outperforming black-box baselines and verbal confidence. Predictive power saturates in intermediate layers. Generalization fails on mathematical reasoning. Same direction captures confidence for "I don't know" responses.

Conclusion: LLMs develop internal self-assessment capabilities mid-computation that generalize across knowledge domains but not mathematical reasoning, providing essential insights into LLM internals and complementing previous findings on truthfulness.

Abstract: Do large language models (LLMs) anticipate when they will answer correctly?
To study this, we extract activations after a question is read but before any
tokens are generated, and train linear probes to predict whether the model's
forthcoming answer will be correct. Across three open-source model families
ranging from 7 to 70 billion parameters, projections on this "in-advance
correctness direction" trained on generic trivia questions predict success in
distribution and on diverse out-of-distribution knowledge datasets,
outperforming black-box baselines and verbalised predicted confidence.
Predictive power saturates in intermediate layers, suggesting that
self-assessment emerges mid-computation. Notably, generalisation falters on
questions requiring mathematical reasoning. Moreover, for models responding "I
don't know", doing so strongly correlates with the probe score, indicating that
the same direction also captures confidence. By complementing previous results
on truthfulness and other behaviours obtained with probes and sparse
auto-encoders, our work contributes essential findings to elucidate LLM
internals.

TL;DR: Computational morphology tools like GlossLM show strong technical performance but fail to meet real-world usability needs in language documentation, requiring User-Centered Design integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the disconnect between computational morphology research and practical language documentation needs, where research outputs see limited real-world use despite technical advances.

Method: Position paper with case study of GlossLM (multilingual IGT generation model), including small-scale user study with three documentary linguists to evaluate usability in real documentation contexts.

Result: Despite strong metric-based performance, the system fails to meet core usability needs. User study revealed new research questions around model constraints, label standardization, segmentation, and personalization.

Conclusion: Centering users through User-Centered Design not only produces more effective tools but surfaces richer, more relevant research directions, preventing the field from becoming decontextualized and ineffectual.

Abstract: Computational morphology has the potential to support language documentation
through tasks like morphological segmentation and the generation of Interlinear
Glossed Text (IGT). However, our research outputs have seen limited use in
real-world language documentation settings. This position paper situates the
disconnect between computational morphology and language documentation within a
broader misalignment between research and practice in NLP and argues that the
field risks becoming decontextualized and ineffectual without systematic
integration of User-Centered Design (UCD). To demonstrate how principles from
UCD can reshape the research agenda, we present a case study of GlossLM, a
state-of-the-art multilingual IGT generation model. Through a small-scale user
study with three documentary linguists, we find that despite strong metric
based performance, the system fails to meet core usability needs in real
documentation contexts. These insights raise new research questions around
model constraints, label standardization, segmentation, and personalization. We
argue that centering users not only produces more effective tools, but surfaces
richer, more relevant research directions

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Entropy neurons in LLMs suppress context copying behavior when contextual information conflicts with parametric knowledge, and ablating these neurons significantly alters generation processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs behave inconsistently when facing conflicting contextual and parametric information, and to investigate the role of entropy neurons in resolving such conflicts.

Method: Analyzed entropy neurons in autoregressive transformer models, examined their impact on output entropy and token ranking, and performed ablation studies to observe changes in generation behavior.

Result: Entropy neurons are responsible for suppressing context copying across various LLMs, and their ablation leads to significant changes in the generation process when handling conflicting information.

Conclusion: These findings enhance our understanding of LLM internal dynamics, particularly how specific neurons manage conflicts between contextual and parametric knowledge.

Abstract: The behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) when facing contextual
information that conflicts with their internal parametric knowledge is
inconsistent, with no generally accepted explanation for the expected outcome
distribution. Recent work has identified in autoregressive transformer models a
class of neurons -- called entropy neurons -- that produce a significant effect
on the model output entropy while having an overall moderate impact on the
ranking of the predicted tokens. In this paper, we investigate the preliminary
claim that these neurons are involved in inhibiting context copying behavior in
transformers by looking at their role in resolving conflicts between contextual
and parametric information. We show that entropy neurons are responsible for
suppressing context copying across a range of LLMs, and that ablating them
leads to a significant change in the generation process. These results enhance
our understanding of the internal dynamics of LLMs when handling conflicting
information.

TL;DR: EthosAgents is a lightweight pluralistic alignment approach that simulates diverse perspectives and values to improve LLM outputs in healthcare and other high-stakes domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment approaches fail to adequately address healthcare-specific pluralism where personal, cultural, and situational factors shape diverse values and perspectives.

Method: Proposed EthosAgents approach designed to simulate diverse perspectives and values, tested across seven varying-sized open and closed models for three different modes.

Result: Empirically demonstrated advancement in pluralistic alignment across all three modes and seven different models, showing improved respect for diversity.

Conclusion: Health-related pluralism requires adaptable and normatively aware approaches, providing insights for better respecting diversity in other high-stakes domains beyond healthcare.

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such
as healthcare, ensuring their outputs reflect the diverse values and
perspectives held across populations is critical. However, existing alignment
approaches, including pluralistic paradigms like Modular Pluralism, often fall
short in the health domain, where personal, cultural, and situational factors
shape pluralism. Motivated by the aforementioned healthcare challenges, we
propose a first lightweight, generalizable, pluralistic alignment approach,
EthosAgents, designed to simulate diverse perspectives and values. We
empirically show that it advances the pluralistic alignment for all three modes
across seven varying-sized open and closed models. Our findings reveal that
health-related pluralism demands adaptable and normatively aware approaches,
offering insights into how these models can better respect diversity in other
high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: Struct-Bench is a benchmark framework for evaluating differentially private synthetic data generation methods on structured datasets containing natural language, using context-free grammars to represent data structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic data evaluation techniques struggle to capture structural properties and correlations in structured datasets with natural language components, which are common in enterprise settings but lack proper evaluation standards.

Method: Proposes a framework requiring users to represent dataset structure as Context-Free Grammars (CFGs), includes 5 real-world and 2 synthetic datasets with CFG annotations, and provides reference implementations of metrics and a leaderboard.

Result: The benchmark demonstrates significant challenges for state-of-the-art DP synthetic data generation methods and provides a standardized evaluation platform for researchers.

Conclusion: Struct-Bench enables standardized evaluation and improvement of privacy-preserving synthetic data generation methods for structured datasets with natural language components, with publicly available benchmark and leaderboard.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation is a promising
technique for utilizing private datasets that otherwise cannot be exposed for
model training or other analytics. While much research literature has focused
on generating private unstructured text and image data, in enterprise settings,
structured data (e.g., tabular) is more common, often including natural
language fields or components. Existing synthetic data evaluation techniques
(e.g., FID) struggle to capture the structural properties and correlations of
such datasets. In this work, we propose Struct-Bench, a framework and benchmark
for evaluating synthetic datasets derived from structured datasets that contain
natural language data. The Struct-Bench framework requires users to provide a
representation of their dataset structure as a Context-Free Grammar (CFG). Our
benchmark comprises 5 real-world and 2 synthetically generated datasets, each
annotated with CFGs. We show that these datasets demonstrably present a great
challenge even for state-of-the-art DP synthetic data generation methods.
Struct-Bench also includes reference implementations of different metrics and a
leaderboard, thereby providing researchers a standardized evaluation platform
to benchmark and investigate privacy-preserving synthetic data generation
methods. Further, we also present a case study showing how to use Struct-Bench
to improve the synthetic data quality of Private Evolution (PE) on structured
data. The benchmark and the leaderboard have been publicly made available at

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their remarkable capabilities in text generation and reasoning. However,
these models face critical challenges when deployed in real-world applications,
including hallucination generation, outdated knowledge, and limited domain
expertise. Retrieval And Structuring (RAS) Augmented Generation addresses these
limitations by integrating dynamic information retrieval with structured
knowledge representations. This survey (1) examines retrieval mechanisms
including sparse, dense, and hybrid approaches for accessing external
knowledge; (2) explore text structuring techniques such as taxonomy
construction, hierarchical classification, and information extraction that
transform unstructured text into organized representations; and (3) investigate
how these structured representations integrate with LLMs through prompt-based
methods, reasoning frameworks, and knowledge embedding techniques. It also
identifies technical challenges in retrieval efficiency, structure quality, and
knowledge integration, while highlighting research opportunities in multimodal
retrieval, cross-lingual structures, and interactive systems. This
comprehensive overview provides researchers and practitioners with insights
into RAS methods, applications, and future directions.

### [152] [SearchInstruct: Enhancing Domain Adaptation via Retrieval-Based Instruction Dataset Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10708)
*Iman Barati,Mostafa Amiri,Heshaam Faili*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SearchInstruct is a method for automatically creating high-quality instruction datasets for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs by expanding human-generated questions with LLMs and retrieving domain-specific resources for answer generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating suitable training datasets for supervised fine-tuning in specific domains is challenging due to domain constraints and data scarcity, requiring an automated approach to generate diverse and high-quality instruction-response pairs.

Method: The approach starts with a limited set of human-generated domain-specific questions, systematically expands them using a large language model, and dynamically retrieves domain-relevant resources to generate accurate and contextually appropriate answers for each augmented question.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows that SearchInstruct enhances both diversity and quality of SFT datasets, leading to measurable improvements in LLM performance within specialized domains, and also facilitates tasks like model editing.

Conclusion: SearchInstruct provides an effective automated solution for generating high-quality instruction datasets for domain-specific SFT, with demonstrated performance improvements and additional applications in model editing, supported by publicly available implementation and resources.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is essential for training large language models
(LLMs), significantly enhancing critical capabilities such as instruction
following and in-context learning. Nevertheless, creating suitable training
datasets tailored for specific domains remains challenging due to unique domain
constraints and data scarcity. In this paper, we propose SearchInstruct, an
innovative method explicitly designed to construct high quality instruction
datasets for SFT. Our approach begins with a limited set of domain specific,
human generated questions, which are systematically expanded using a large
language model. Subsequently, domain relevant resources are dynamically
retrieved to generate accurate and contextually appropriate answers for each
augmented question. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that SearchInstruct
enhances both the diversity and quality of SFT datasets, leading to measurable
improvements in LLM performance within specialized domains. Additionally, we
show that beyond dataset generation, the proposed method can also effectively
facilitate tasks such as model editing, enabling efficient updates to existing
models. To facilitate reproducibility and community adoption, we provide full
implementation details, the complete set of generated instruction response
pairs, and the source code in a publicly accessible Git repository:

*Zaur Gouliev,Jennifer Waters,Chengqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic comparison of 5 multilingual transformer models for disinformation detection across 25+ languages, introducing a new 60K+ statement corpus showing performance variations with RemBERT excelling in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most AI models are benchmarked only on English despite disinformation spreading rapidly across linguistic boundaries, creating a gap in multilingual disinformation detection capabilities.

Method: Compared mBERT, XLM, XLM-RoBERTa, RemBERT, and mT5 on fake-vs-true classification using the novel PolyTruth Disinfo Corpus of 60,486 statement pairs spanning 25+ languages across 5 language families.

Result: Performance variations observed - RemBERT achieved better overall accuracy, particularly in low-resource languages, while mBERT and XLM showed limitations with scarce training data.

Conclusion: Findings reveal both potential and current limitations of AI systems for multilingual disinformation detection, with dataset made publicly available to encourage further research.

Abstract: Disinformation spreads rapidly across linguistic boundaries, yet most AI
models are still benchmarked only on English. We address this gap with a
systematic comparison of five multilingual transformer models: mBERT, XLM,
XLM-RoBERTa, RemBERT, and mT5 on a common fake-vs-true machine learning
classification task. While transformer-based language models have demonstrated
notable success in detecting disinformation in English, their effectiveness in
multilingual contexts still remains up for debate. To facilitate evaluation, we
introduce PolyTruth Disinfo Corpus, a novel corpus of 60,486 statement pairs
(false claim vs. factual correction) spanning over twenty five languages that
collectively cover five language families and a broad topical range from
politics, health, climate, finance, and conspiracy, half of which are
fact-checked disinformation claims verified by an augmented MindBugs Discovery
dataset. Our experiments revealed performance variations. Models such as
RemBERT achieved better overall accuracy, particularly excelling in
low-resource languages, whereas models like mBERT and XLM exhibit considerable
limitations when training data is scarce. We provide a discussion of these
performance patterns and implications for real-world deployment. The dataset is
publicly available on our GitHub repository to encourage further
experimentation and advancement. Our findings illuminate both the potential and
the current limitations of AI systems for multilingual disinformation
detection.

### [154] [Reasoning Under Uncertainty: Exploring Probabilistic Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10739)
*Mobina Pournemat,Keivan Rezaei,Gaurang Sriramanan,Arman Zarei,Jiaxiang Fu,Yang Wang,Hamid Eghbalzadeh,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show inconsistent probabilistic reasoning abilities, with larger models performing better but still having significant limitations in handling probability distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively evaluate how large language models handle probabilistic reasoning tasks with explicit discrete probability distributions, as current models exhibit unclear and inconsistent behavior in this area.

Method: Evaluated LLMs on three tasks (mode identification, maximum likelihood estimation, and sample generation) using observations from probability distributions, testing both joint distribution and conditional queries to probe frequency analysis, marginalization, and generative capabilities.

Result: Larger models showed stronger inference and surprising sample generation capabilities compared to smaller models, but exhibited sensitivity to notation variations and performance degradation of over 60% with increasing context length.

Conclusion: There's a clear performance gap between model sizes in probabilistic reasoning, with notable limitations that need addressing for future improvements in LLM capabilities.

Abstract: Despite widespread success in language understanding and generation, large
language models (LLMs) exhibit unclear and often inconsistent behavior when
faced with tasks that require probabilistic reasoning. In this work, we present
the first comprehensive study of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs over
explicit discrete probability distributions. Given observations from a
probability distribution, we evaluate models on three carefully designed tasks,
mode identification, maximum likelihood estimation, and sample generation, by
prompting them to provide responses to queries about either the joint
distribution or its conditionals. These tasks thus probe a range of
probabilistic skills, including frequency analysis, marginalization, and
generative behavior. Through comprehensive empirical evaluations, we
demonstrate that there exists a clear performance gap between smaller and
larger models, with the latter demonstrating stronger inference and surprising
capabilities in sample generation. Furthermore, our investigations reveal
notable limitations, including sensitivity to variations in the notation
utilized to represent probabilistic outcomes and performance degradation of
over 60% as context length increases. Together, our results provide a detailed
understanding of the probabilistic reasoning abilities of LLMs and identify key
directions for future improvement.

*Ozan Gokdemir,Neil Getty,Robert Underwood,Sandeep Madireddy,Franck Cappello,Arvind Ramanathan,Ian T. Foster,Rick L. Stevens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A scalable framework for automatically generating multiple-choice question benchmarks from scientific papers, with a case study showing reasoning-trace retrieval helps small models outperform GPT-4 on cancer biology exams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific knowledge grows rapidly, requiring evolving benchmarks to test language models on current literature and ensure they reflect new discoveries.

Method: Automated pipeline for MCQA creation including PDF parsing, semantic chunking, question generation, and model evaluation. Uses retrieval-augmented generation with paper-derived semantic chunks and reasoning traces from GPT-4.1.

Result: Generated 16,000+ MCQs from 22,000 radiation/cancer biology papers. Reasoning-trace retrieval consistently improved performance, enabling small models (1.1B-14B parameters) to surpass GPT-4 on 2023 Astro Radiation and Cancer Biology exam.

Conclusion: The framework provides scalable benchmark generation, and reasoning-trace retrieval is an effective method for enhancing small language model performance on scientific question-answering tasks.

Abstract: As scientific knowledge grows at an unprecedented pace, evaluation benchmarks
must evolve to reflect new discoveries and ensure language models are tested on
current, diverse literature. We propose a scalable, modular framework for
generating multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) benchmarks directly from
large corpora of scientific papers. Our pipeline automates every stage of MCQA
creation, including PDF parsing, semantic chunking, question generation, and
model evaluation. As a case study, we generate more than 16,000 MCQs from
22,000 open-access articles in radiation and cancer biology. We then evaluate a
suite of small language models (1.1B-14B parameters) on these questions,
comparing baseline accuracy with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) from
paper-derived semantic chunks and from reasoning traces distilled from GPT-4.1.
We find that reasoning-trace retrieval consistently improves performance on
both synthetic and expert-annotated benchmarks, enabling several small models
to surpass GPT-4 on the 2023 Astro Radiation and Cancer Biology exam.

### [156] [RECAP: Transparent Inference-Time Emotion Alignment for Medical Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10746)
*Adarsh Srinivasan,Jacob Dineen,Muhammad Umar Afzal,Muhammad Uzair Sarfraz,Irbaz B. Riaz,Ben Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP is an inference-time framework that enhances emotional reasoning in medical LLMs by adding structured emotional appraisal without retraining, improving emotional intelligence by 22-28% on smaller models while maintaining medical accuracy and accountability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current healthcare LLMs deliver medically sound but emotionally flat advice, missing critical emotional cues that are essential for distressed and vulnerable patients who require empathic communication to support safety, adherence, and trust.

Method: RECAP (Reflect-Extract-Calibrate-Align-Produce) framework decomposes empathy into transparent appraisal-theoretic stages using structured emotional reasoning at inference time without retraining, exposing per-dimension Likert signals for auditable responses.

Result: Across EmoBench, SECEU, and EQ-Bench, RECAP improves emotional reasoning by 22-28% on 8B models and 10-13% on larger models over zero-shot baselines. Clinician evaluations confirm superior empathetic communication.

Conclusion: Modular, theory-grounded prompting can systematically enhance emotional intelligence in medical AI while preserving the accountability required for clinical deployment, demonstrating that structured emotional reasoning frameworks can bridge the empathy gap in healthcare LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models in healthcare often miss critical emotional cues,
delivering medically sound but emotionally flat advice. This is especially
problematic in clinical contexts where patients are distressed and vulnerable,
and require empathic communication to support safety, adherence, and trust. We
present RECAP (Reflect-Extract-Calibrate-Align-Produce), an inference-time
framework that adds structured emotional reasoning without retraining. By
decomposing empathy into transparent appraisal-theoretic stages and exposing
per-dimension Likert signals, RECAP produces nuanced, auditable responses.
Across EmoBench, SECEU, and EQ-Bench, RECAP improves emotional reasoning by
22-28% on 8B models and 10-13% on larger models over zero-shot baselines.
Clinician evaluations further confirm superior empathetic communication. RECAP
shows that modular, theory-grounded prompting can systematically enhance
emotional intelligence in medical AI while preserving the accountability
required for deployment.

### [157] [Judge Q: Trainable Queries for Optimized Information Retention in KV Cache Eviction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10798)
*Yijun Liu,Yixuan Wang,Yuzhuang Xu,Shiyu Ji,Yang Xu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Judge Q is a novel training method that uses soft tokens to improve KV cache eviction by capturing global information, reducing performance degradation while maintaining low training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KV cache eviction methods focus too much on local information from the last window, potentially missing crucial global context, which affects memory usage and decoding efficiency in large language models.

Method: Proposes Judge Q method that trains soft tokens appended to input sequences. Only tunes the embedding layer at low cost. Soft tokens' attention maps align with actual decoded tokens to capture global information for better KV importance evaluation.

Result: Under same eviction budget, shows less performance degradation. Improves LongBench by ~1 point and RULER by over 3 points. Validated on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 models.

Conclusion: The method effectively maintains decoding quality during KV cache eviction by capturing global information through soft tokens, with minimal training overhead and seamless integration into existing models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) utilize key-value (KV) cache to store historical
information during sequence processing. The size of KV cache grows linearly as
the length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and
decoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize
the last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV
importance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it
tends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect
or omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose
Judge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This
method only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By
concatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train
these tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that
of the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the
soft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the
importance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining
decoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our
method exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction
approaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models
such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks
including LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Results indicate an
improvement of approximately 1 point on the LongBench and over 3 points on
RULER. This proposed methodology can be seamlessly integrated into existing
open-source models with minimal training overhead, thereby enhancing
performance in KV cache eviction scenarios.

### [158] [Towards Automated Error Discovery: A Study in Conversational AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10833)
*Dominic Petrak,Thy Thy Tran,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework called Automated Error Discovery with SEEED implementation that detects unknown errors in conversational AI using enhanced contrastive learning, outperforming LLM baselines like GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle to detect errors not explicitly specified in instructions, especially those from model updates or user behavior shifts, creating deployment risks.

Method: Proposes SEEED - an encoder-based approach using enhanced Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss with amplified negative sample weighting and Label-Based Sample Ranking for better contrastive representation learning.

Result: Outperforms GPT-4o and Phi-4 baselines across multiple error-annotated dialogue datasets, improving unknown error detection accuracy by up to 8 points with strong generalization to unknown intent detection.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the limitation of LLMs in discovering unspecified errors, providing a robust solution for error detection in evolving conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Although LLM-based conversational agents demonstrate strong fluency and
coherence, they still produce undesirable behaviors (errors) that are
challenging to prevent from reaching users during deployment. Recent research
leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect errors and guide
response-generation models toward improvement. However, current LLMs struggle
to identify errors not explicitly specified in their instructions, such as
those arising from updates to the response-generation model or shifts in user
behavior. In this work, we introduce Automated Error Discovery, a framework for
detecting and defining errors in conversational AI, and propose SEEED (Soft
Clustering Extended Encoder-Based Error Detection), as an encoder-based
approach to its implementation. We enhance the Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss by
amplifying distance weighting for negative samples and introduce Label-Based
Sample Ranking to select highly contrastive examples for better representation
learning. SEEED outperforms adapted baselines -- including GPT-4o and Phi-4 --
across multiple error-annotated dialogue datasets, improving the accuracy for
detecting unknown errors by up to 8 points and demonstrating strong
generalization to unknown intent detection.

### [159] [Evaluating Large Language Models for Evidence-Based Clinical Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10843)
*Can Wang,Yiqun Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show promise but limitations in evidence-based clinical QA. Performance varies by source type (90% on structured guidelines vs 60-70% on narrative/systematic reviews). Retrieval-augmented prompting significantly improves accuracy when using gold-standard sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate LLMs' ability to answer nuanced, evidence-based clinical questions from diverse sources including Cochrane reviews and clinical guidelines, to understand their potential and limitations in healthcare applications.

Method: Curated multi-source benchmark from Cochrane systematic reviews and clinical guidelines. Tested GPT-4o-mini and GPT-5 with various prompting strategies including retrieval-augmented prompting using gold-source abstracts and PubMed search results.

Result: Accuracy highest on structured guidelines (90%), lower on narrative/systematic reviews (60-70%). Citation count strongly correlated with accuracy. Retrieval-augmented prompting with gold-source abstracts improved accuracy to 0.79, while PubMed abstracts (top 3 relevant) improved to 0.23. Random abstracts reduced accuracy.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for evidence-based clinical QA but have limitations. Source clarity and targeted retrieval are crucial for performance. Retrieval-augmented prompting improves factual accuracy, and stratified evaluation by specialty/question type is essential for understanding model capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial progress in
biomedical and clinical applications, motivating rigorous evaluation of their
ability to answer nuanced, evidence-based questions. We curate a multi-source
benchmark drawing from Cochrane systematic reviews and clinical guidelines,
including structured recommendations from the American Heart Association and
narrative guidance used by insurers. Using GPT-4o-mini and GPT-5, we observe
consistent performance patterns across sources and clinical domains: accuracy
is highest on structured guideline recommendations (90%) and lower on narrative
guideline and systematic review questions (60--70%). We also find a strong
correlation between accuracy and the citation count of the underlying
systematic reviews, where each doubling of citations is associated with roughly
a 30% increase in the odds of a correct answer. Models show moderate ability to
reason about evidence quality when contextual information is supplied. When we
incorporate retrieval-augmented prompting, providing the gold-source abstract
raises accuracy on previously incorrect items to 0.79; providing top 3 PubMed
abstracts (ranked by semantic relevance) improves accuracy to 0.23, while
random abstracts reduce accuracy (0.10, within temperature variation). These
effects are mirrored in GPT-4o-mini, underscoring that source clarity and
targeted retrieval -- not just model size -- drive performance. Overall, our
results highlight both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for
evidence-based clinical question answering. Retrieval-augmented prompting
emerges as a useful strategy to improve factual accuracy and alignment with
source evidence, while stratified evaluation by specialty and question type
remains essential to understand current knowledge access and to contextualize
model performance.

### [160] [GAPrune: Gradient-Alignment Pruning for Domain-Aware Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10844)
*Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GAPrune is a novel pruning framework that selectively compresses domain-specific embedding models by considering both domain importance and general linguistic preservation, achieving near-original performance at 50% sparsity and even performance improvements with retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific embedding models outperform general models but are based on large LLMs that are challenging to deploy in resource-constrained environments. Existing pruning methods treat all parameters uniformly and fail to distinguish between general semantic representations and domain-specific patterns.

Method: GAPrune uses Fisher Information to measure importance and general-domain gradient alignment to assess parameter behavior, combining these signals using Domain Alignment Importance (DAI) scoring. Lower DAI scores indicate parameters that are less important for domain tasks or create conflicts between domain and general objectives.

Result: GAPrune maintains performance within 2.5% of dense models in one-shot pruning at 50% sparsity. With 100-step retraining, it achieves +4.51% improvement on FinMTEB and +1.73% on ChemTEB, outperforming all baselines.

Conclusion: Principled pruning strategies can achieve both model compression and enhanced domain specialization, providing a new approach for developing efficient domain-specific embedding models.

Abstract: Domain-specific embedding models have shown promise for applications that
require specialized semantic understanding, such as coding agents and financial
retrieval systems, often achieving higher performance gains than general
models. However, state-of-the-art embedding models are typically based on LLMs,
which contain billions of parameters, making deployment challenging in
resource-constrained environments. Model compression through pruning offers a
promising solution, but existing pruning methods treat all parameters
uniformly, failing to distinguish between general semantic representations and
domain-specific patterns, leading to suboptimal pruning decisions. Thus, we
propose GAPrune, a pruning framework that addresses this challenge by
considering both domain importance and preserving general linguistic
foundation. Our method uses Fisher Information to measure importance and
general-domain gradient alignment to assess parameter behavior, then combines
these signals using our Domain Alignment Importance (DAI) scoring. Lower DAI
scores indicate that the parameter is either less important for the domain task
or creates conflicts between domain and general objectives. Experiments on two
domain benchmarks, FinMTEB and ChemTEB, show that GAPrune maintains performance
within 2.5% of dense models in one-shot pruning at 50% sparsity, while
outperforming all baselines. With retraining in 100 steps, GAPrune achieves
+4.51% improvement on FinMTEB and +1.73% on ChemTEB, demonstrating that our
pruning strategy not only preserves but enhances domain-specific capabilities.
Our findings demonstrate that principled pruning strategies can achieve model
compression and enhanced domain specialization, providing the research
community with a new approach for development.

### [161] [Text2Sign Diffusion: A Generative Approach for Gloss-Free Sign Language Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10845)
*Liqian Feng,Lintao Wang,Kun Hu,Dehui Kong,Zhiyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text2SignDiff is a gloss-free sign language production method that uses diffusion models to directly translate spoken text to sign language sequences without intermediate gloss annotations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLP methods rely on gloss annotations which are often unavailable and language-specific, limiting flexibility and generalization. The goal is to bridge the communication gap for deaf communities without requiring gloss.

Method: A gloss-free latent diffusion model generates sign sequences from noisy latent codes and spoken text through non-autoregressive iterative denoising. A cross-modal signing aligner learns a shared latent space to bridge visual and textual content.

Result: Extensive experiments on PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, showing the method's effectiveness in accurate and contextually relevant sign language generation.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion-based approach successfully eliminates the need for gloss annotations while achieving superior performance, making SLP more flexible and generalizable across languages.

Abstract: Sign language production (SLP) aims to translate spoken language sentences
into a sequence of pose frames in a sign language, bridging the communication
gap and promoting digital inclusion for deaf and hard-of-hearing communities.
Existing methods typically rely on gloss, a symbolic representation of sign
language words or phrases that serves as an intermediate step in SLP. This
limits the flexibility and generalization of SLP, as gloss annotations are
often unavailable and language-specific. Therefore, we present a novel
diffusion-based generative approach - Text2Sign Diffusion (Text2SignDiff) for
gloss-free SLP. Specifically, a gloss-free latent diffusion model is proposed
to generate sign language sequences from noisy latent sign codes and spoken
text jointly, reducing the potential error accumulation through a
non-autoregressive iterative denoising process. We also design a cross-modal
signing aligner that learns a shared latent space to bridge visual and textual
content in sign and spoken languages. This alignment supports the conditioned
diffusion-based process, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant sign
language generation without gloss. Extensive experiments on the commonly used
PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving the state-of-the-art performance.

### [162] [A funny companion: Distinct neural responses to perceived AI- versus human- generated humor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10847)
*Xiaohui Rao,Hanlin Wu,Zhenguang G. Cai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EEG study shows people find AI humor as funny as human humor but process it differently - AI humor requires less cognitive effort but elicits greater surprise and emotional response, with effects improving over time as expectations adapt.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how people cognitively and emotionally respond to AI humor as AI companions become capable of human-like communication including joke-telling.

Method: Used electroencephalography (EEG) to compare neural processing of humor from AI versus human sources, analyzing behavioral ratings and neurophysiological data including N400 and LPP components.

Result: Participants rated AI and human humor as equally funny. Neurophysiological data showed AI humor elicited smaller N400 (reduced cognitive effort) but larger LPP (greater surprise/emotional response). AI humor showed increasing efficiency and emotional reward over time, while human humor showed habituation effects.

Conclusion: The brain responds to AI humor with surprisingly positive and intense reactions, demonstrating how cognitive adaptation to AI's language patterns can lead to intensified emotional reward, challenging algorithm aversion and highlighting humor's potential for genuine human-AI engagement.

Abstract: As AI companions become capable of human-like communication, including
telling jokes, understanding how people cognitively and emotionally respond to
AI humor becomes increasingly important. This study used electroencephalography
(EEG) to compare how people process humor from AI versus human sources.
Behavioral analysis revealed that participants rated AI and human humor as
comparably funny. However, neurophysiological data showed that AI humor
elicited a smaller N400 effect, suggesting reduced cognitive effort during the
processing of incongruity. This was accompanied by a larger Late Positive
Potential (LPP), indicating a greater degree of surprise and emotional
response. This enhanced LPP likely stems from the violation of low initial
expectations regarding AI's comedic capabilities. Furthermore, a key temporal
dynamic emerged: human humor showed habituation effects, marked by an
increasing N400 and a decreasing LPP over time. In contrast, AI humor
demonstrated increasing processing efficiency and emotional reward, with a
decreasing N400 and an increasing LPP. This trajectory reveals how the brain
can dynamically update its predictive model of AI capabilities. This process of
cumulative reinforcement challenges "algorithm aversion" in humor, as it
demonstrates how cognitive adaptation to AI's language patterns can lead to an
intensified emotional reward. Additionally, participants' social attitudes
toward AI modulated these neural responses, with higher perceived AI
trustworthiness correlating with enhanced emotional engagement. These findings
indicate that the brain responds to AI humor with surprisingly positive and
intense reactions, highlighting humor's potential for fostering genuine
engagement in human-AI social interaction.

*Sangyeop Kim,Yohan Lee,Sanghwa Kim,Hyunjong Kim,Sungzoon Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREMem shifts complex reasoning from response generation to memory construction, creating categorized memory fragments with explicit relationships across sessions to improve conversational AI memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational AI systems place excessive reasoning burden on response generation, making performance heavily dependent on model sizes and creating computational inefficiencies during interactions.

Method: PREMem extracts fine-grained memory fragments categorized into factual, experiential, and subjective information, then establishes explicit relationships between memory items across sessions to capture evolution patterns like extensions, transformations, and implications.

Result: Experiments show significant performance improvements across all model sizes, with smaller models achieving results comparable to much larger baselines while maintaining effectiveness even with constrained token budgets.

Conclusion: PREMem demonstrates that shifting reasoning processes to memory construction rather than response generation creates enriched representations while reducing computational demands, making conversational AI memory more efficient across different model scales.

Abstract: Effective long-term memory in conversational AI requires synthesizing
information across multiple sessions. However, current systems place excessive
reasoning burden on response generation, making performance significantly
dependent on model sizes. We introduce PREMem (Pre-storage Reasoning for
Episodic Memory), a novel approach that shifts complex reasoning processes from
inference to memory construction. PREMem extracts fine-grained memory fragments
categorized into factual, experiential, and subjective information; it then
establishes explicit relationships between memory items across sessions,
capturing evolution patterns like extensions, transformations, and
implications. By performing this reasoning during pre-storage rather than when
generating a response, PREMem creates enriched representations while reducing
computational demands during interactions. Experiments show significant
performance improvements across all model sizes, with smaller models achieving
results comparable to much larger baselines while maintaining effectiveness
even with constrained token budgets. Code and dataset are available at

### [164] [Quantifier Scope Interpretation in Language Learners and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10860)
*Shaohua Fang,Yue Li,Yan Cong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show human-like quantifier scope interpretation preferences, with surface scope alignment across languages but varying inverse scope patterns between English and Chinese.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how large language models handle quantifier scope ambiguities across different languages and assess their similarity to human interpretation patterns.

Method: Cross-linguistic analysis using probabilities to assess interpretive likelihood, with human similarity scores to quantify LLM emulation of human performance in English and Chinese.

Result: Most LLMs prefer surface scope interpretations (aligning with humans), some differentiate English/Chinese inverse scope preferences, and model architecture/scale/pre-training data significantly influence human approximation.

Conclusion: LLMs show notable potential to align with human quantifier scope interpretations, with performance influenced by model characteristics and language background of pre-training data.

Abstract: Sentences with multiple quantifiers often lead to interpretive ambiguities,
which can vary across languages. This study adopts a cross-linguistic approach
to examine how large language models (LLMs) handle quantifier scope
interpretation in English and Chinese, using probabilities to assess
interpretive likelihood. Human similarity (HS) scores were used to quantify the
extent to which LLMs emulate human performance across language groups. Results
reveal that most LLMs prefer the surface scope interpretations, aligning with
human tendencies, while only some differentiate between English and Chinese in
the inverse scope preferences, reflecting human-similar patterns. HS scores
highlight variability in LLMs' approximation of human behavior, but their
overall potential to align with humans is notable. Differences in model
architecture, scale, and particularly models' pre-training data language
background, significantly influence how closely LLMs approximate human
quantifier scope interpretations.

### [165] [Term2Note: Synthesising Differentially Private Clinical Notes from Medical Terms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10882)
*Yuping Wu,Viktor Schlegel,Warren Del-Pinto,Srinivasan Nandakumar,Iqra Zahid,Yidan Sun,Usama Farghaly Omar,Amirah Jasmine,Arun-Kumar Kaliya-Perumal,Chun Shen Tham,Gabriel Connors,Anil A Bharath,Goran Nenadic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Term2Note is a differentially private method for synthesizing clinical notes that separates content and form generation, achieving high fidelity and utility while providing strong privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns in healthcare limit the use of real clinical data for ML training. DP synthetic data offers privacy guarantees but struggles with balancing privacy and utility in complex clinical note generation.

Method: Structurally separates content and form generation, creates section-wise note content conditioned on DP medical terms with separate DP constraints, and uses a DP quality maximizer to select high-quality outputs.

Result: Produces synthetic notes with statistical properties closely aligned with real clinical notes. Classification models trained on synthetic data perform comparably to those trained on real data.

Conclusion: Term2Note achieves substantial improvements over existing DP text generation methods with fewer assumptions, making it a viable privacy-preserving alternative for clinical data.

Abstract: Training data is fundamental to the success of modern machine learning
models, yet in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, the use of real-world
training data is severely constrained by concerns over privacy leakage. A
promising solution to this challenge is the use of differentially private (DP)
synthetic data, which offers formal privacy guarantees while maintaining data
utility. However, striking the right balance between privacy protection and
utility remains challenging in clinical note synthesis, given its domain
specificity and the complexity of long-form text generation. In this paper, we
present Term2Note, a methodology to synthesise long clinical notes under strong
DP constraints. By structurally separating content and form, Term2Note
generates section-wise note content conditioned on DP medical terms, with each
governed by separate DP constraints. A DP quality maximiser further enhances
synthetic notes by selecting high-quality outputs. Experimental results show
that Term2Note produces synthetic notes with statistical properties closely
aligned with real clinical notes, demonstrating strong fidelity. In addition,
multi-label classification models trained on these synthetic notes perform
comparably to those trained on real data, confirming their high utility.
Compared to existing DP text generation baselines, Term2Note achieves
substantial improvements in both fidelity and utility while operating under
fewer assumptions, suggesting its potential as a viable privacy-preserving
alternative to using sensitive clinical notes.

*Xinyu Zhang,Pei Zhang,Shuang Luo,Jialong Tang,Yu Wan,Baosong Yang,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CultureSynth is a framework that creates synthetic cultural benchmarks using RAG to assess LLM cultural competence across 7 languages, revealing performance stratification and geographic disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cultural benchmarks for LLMs suffer from fragmented taxonomies, domain specificity, and heavy reliance on manual annotation, limiting scalable evaluation of cultural competence.

Method: Developed a hierarchical multilingual cultural taxonomy (12 primary, 130 secondary topics) and used RAG methodology to synthesize culturally relevant question-answer pairs from factual knowledge.

Result: Created CultureSynth-7 benchmark with 19,360 entries (4,149 manually verified). Evaluation of 14 LLMs showed ChatGPT-4o-Latest and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct lead performance, with 3B parameters needed for basic competence, architectural biases, and geographic disparities.

Conclusion: CultureSynth provides a scalable framework for developing culturally aware AI systems while reducing manual annotation dependency, enabling better assessment of LLM cultural competence across diverse contexts.

Abstract: Cultural competence, defined as the ability to understand and adapt to
multicultural contexts, is increasingly vital for large language models (LLMs)
in global environments. While several cultural benchmarks exist to assess LLMs'
cultural competence, current evaluations suffer from fragmented taxonomies,
domain specificity, and heavy reliance on manual data annotation. To address
these limitations, we introduce CultureSynth, a novel framework comprising (1)
a comprehensive hierarchical multilingual cultural taxonomy covering 12 primary
and 130 secondary topics, and (2) a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based
methodology leveraging factual knowledge to synthesize culturally relevant
question-answer pairs. The CultureSynth-7 synthetic benchmark contains 19,360
entries and 4,149 manually verified entries across 7 languages. Evaluation of
14 prevalent LLMs of different sizes reveals clear performance stratification
led by ChatGPT-4o-Latest and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct. The results demonstrate that
a 3B-parameter threshold is necessary for achieving basic cultural competence,
models display varying architectural biases in knowledge processing, and
significant geographic disparities exist across models. We believe that
CultureSynth offers a scalable framework for developing culturally aware AI
systems while reducing reliance on manual annotation\footnote{Benchmark is

*Tsuyoshi Iwata,Guillaume Comte,Melissa Flores,Ryoma Kondo,Ryohei Hisano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A semi-automatic method using ontology design, pattern modeling, and LLMs to convert ESG principles into reusable templates for extracting structured knowledge from news content and linking incidents to sustainability frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing need for accurate ESG data alignment with international frameworks like UN Global Compact and SDGs, despite challenges from abstract language and lack of standardized taxonomies in commercial data systems.

Method: Uses lightweight ontology design, formal pattern modeling, and large language models to create RDF templates that extract ESG events from news and populate structured knowledge graphs.

Result: Creates a scalable and transparent framework for identifying non-compliance with international sustainability guidelines by linking reported incidents to specific framework principles.

Conclusion: Provides an effective approach for structured representation of ESG controversies that bridges the gap between abstract normative frameworks and real-world news reporting.

Abstract: The growing importance of environmental, social, and governance data in
regulatory and investment contexts has increased the need for accurate,
interpretable, and internationally aligned representations of non-financial
risks, particularly those reported in unstructured news sources. However,
aligning such controversy-related data with principle-based normative
frameworks, such as the United Nations Global Compact or Sustainable
Development Goals, presents significant challenges. These frameworks are
typically expressed in abstract language, lack standardized taxonomies, and
differ from the proprietary classification systems used by commercial data
providers. In this paper, we present a semi-automatic method for constructing
structured knowledge representations of environmental, social, and governance
events reported in the news. Our approach uses lightweight ontology design,
formal pattern modeling, and large language models to convert normative
principles into reusable templates expressed in the Resource Description
Framework. These templates are used to extract relevant information from news
content and populate a structured knowledge graph that links reported incidents
to specific framework principles. The result is a scalable and transparent
framework for identifying and interpreting non-compliance with international
sustainability guidelines.

Conclusion: Spotlight represents a novel and effective paradigm for information extraction that successfully boosts reader engagement by selectively highlighting compelling content rather than providing comprehensive coverage.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Spotlight, a novel paradigm for information
extraction that produces concise, engaging narratives by highlighting the most
compelling aspects of a document. Unlike traditional summaries, which
prioritize comprehensive coverage, spotlights selectively emphasize intriguing
content to foster deeper reader engagement with the source material. We
formally differentiate spotlights from related constructs and support our
analysis with a detailed benchmarking study using new datasets curated for this
work. To generate high-quality spotlights, we propose a two-stage approach:
fine-tuning a large language model on our benchmark data, followed by alignment
via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our comprehensive evaluation
demonstrates that the resulting model not only identifies key elements with
precision but also enhances readability and boosts the engagement value of the
original document.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A two-stage framework for explainable clickbait detection that identifies clickbait headlines and attributes them to specific linguistic manipulation strategies using BERT and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clickbait headlines threaten information credibility and user trust, but existing ML detection methods lack explainability, limiting practical adoption.

Method: Created synthetic dataset by augmenting real headlines with predefined clickbait strategies. Two-stage framework: 1) Detection using fine-tuned BERT vs LLMs (GPT-4.0, Gemini 2.4 Flash) with zero-shot/few-shot prompting, 2) BERT-based classifier for tactic attribution.

Result: Developed a transparent system that not only detects clickbait but also explains the specific manipulation strategies used, enabling controlled experimentation and detailed analysis.

Conclusion: This work advances trustworthy AI systems for combating manipulative media content by providing explainable detection and attribution of clickbait tactics.

Abstract: The proliferation of clickbait headlines poses significant challenges to the
credibility of information and user trust in digital media. While recent
advances in machine learning have improved the detection of manipulative
content, the lack of explainability limits their practical adoption. This paper
presents a model for explainable clickbait detection that not only identifies
clickbait titles but also attributes them to specific linguistic manipulation
strategies. We introduce a synthetic dataset generated by systematically
augmenting real news headlines using a predefined catalogue of clickbait
strategies. This dataset enables controlled experimentation and detailed
analysis of model behaviour. We present a two-stage framework for automatic
clickbait analysis comprising detection and tactic attribution. In the first
stage, we compare a fine-tuned BERT classifier with large language models
(LLMs), specifically GPT-4.0 and Gemini 2.4 Flash, under both zero-shot
prompting and few-shot prompting enriched with illustrative clickbait headlines
and their associated persuasive tactics. In the second stage, a dedicated
BERT-based classifier predicts the specific clickbait strategies present in
each headline. This work advances the development of transparent and
trustworthy AI systems for combating manipulative media content. We share the
dataset with the research community at

*Haokun Li,Yazhou Zhang,Jizhi Ding,Qiuchi Li,Peng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmoBench-Reddit is a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating multimodal emotion understanding in MLLMs, featuring 350 curated Reddit samples with images, text, and emotion categories, progressing from basic perception to advanced cognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM evaluation benchmarks focus on objective visual tasks but inadequately assess models' ability to understand complex and subjective human emotions, creating a gap in comprehensive evaluation.

Method: Created a dataset of 350 Reddit samples with images, user text, and emotion categories. Designed hierarchical tasks with 6 multiple-choice and 1 open-ended question per sample, progressing from perception (basic visual elements) to cognition (scene reasoning, intent understanding, empathy). Used AI assistance (Claude 4) and manual verification for annotation quality.

Result: The paper introduces EmoBench-Reddit as a novel benchmark, but specific evaluation results on existing MLLMs are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: EmoBench-Reddit addresses the critical gap in evaluating multimodal emotion understanding capabilities of MLLMs, providing a structured framework to assess models' progression from basic perception to advanced cognitive and empathetic abilities.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they
have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a variety of vision-language
tasks. However, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on objective
visual question answering or captioning, inadequately assessing the models'
ability to understand complex and subjective human emotions. To bridge this
gap, we introduce EmoBench-Reddit, a novel, hierarchical benchmark for
multimodal emotion understanding. The dataset comprises 350 meticulously
curated samples from the social media platform Reddit, each containing an
image, associated user-provided text, and an emotion category (sad, humor,
sarcasm, happy) confirmed by user flairs. We designed a hierarchical task
framework that progresses from basic perception to advanced cognition, with
each data point featuring six multiple-choice questions and one open-ended
question of increasing difficulty. Perception tasks evaluate the model's
ability to identify basic visual elements (e.g., colors, objects), while
cognition tasks require scene reasoning, intent understanding, and deep empathy
integrating textual context. We ensured annotation quality through a
combination of AI assistance (Claude 4) and manual verification.

TL;DR: Fluid Benchmarking is a new adaptive evaluation approach for language models that uses item response theory and dynamic item selection to improve benchmarking efficiency, validity, and reduce variance compared to traditional static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LM benchmarking faces challenges including high evaluation costs, poor measurement of intended capabilities, labeling errors, and benchmark saturation. Existing solutions address these issues in isolation rather than holistically.

Method: Fluid Benchmarking estimates an item response model from existing LM evaluation results and uses inferred quantities to dynamically select evaluation items, similar to computerized adaptive testing in education.

Result: The approach achieves superior performance across four dimensions - efficiency, validity, variance, and saturation. It shows higher validity and less variance on MMLU with fifty times fewer items compared to random sampling and other baselines.

Conclusion: LM benchmarking can be substantially improved by moving beyond static evaluation through adaptive approaches like Fluid Benchmarking, which combines item response theory for validity and dynamic item selection for reduced variance.

Abstract: Language model (LM) benchmarking faces several challenges: comprehensive
evaluations are costly, benchmarks often fail to measure the intended
capabilities, and evaluation quality can degrade due to labeling errors and
benchmark saturation. Although various strategies have been proposed to
mitigate these issues, they tend to address individual aspects in isolation,
neglecting broader questions about overall evaluation quality. Here, we
introduce Fluid Benchmarking, a new evaluation approach that advances LM
benchmarking across multiple dimensions. Inspired by psychometrics, Fluid
Benchmarking is based on the insight that the relative value of benchmark items
depends on an LM's capability level, suggesting that evaluation should adapt to
each LM. Methodologically, Fluid Benchmarking estimates an item response model
based on existing LM evaluation results and uses the inferred quantities to
select evaluation items dynamically, similar to computerized adaptive testing
in education. In our experiments, we compare Fluid Benchmarking against the
common practice of random item sampling as well as more sophisticated
baselines, including alternative methods grounded in item response theory. We
examine four dimensions -- efficiency, validity, variance, and saturation --
and find that Fluid Benchmarking achieves superior performance in all of them
(e.g., higher validity and less variance on MMLU with fifty times fewer items).
Our analysis shows that the two components of Fluid Benchmarking have distinct
effects: item response theory, used to map performance into a latent ability
space, increases validity, while dynamic item selection reduces variance.
Overall, our results suggest that LM benchmarking can be substantially improved
by moving beyond static evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes PAN-DG task for personality-driven argumentation-based negotiation dialogue generation and introduces PACT dataset with three personality profiles for tourism negotiations, showing fine-tuned LLMs effectively generate personalized rational responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance negotiation dialogue systems by integrating argumentation mechanisms and personality attributes for better conflict resolution and adaptability to individual preferences and styles.

Method: Created PACT dataset using LLMs with three personality profiles (Argumentation, Preference, Buying Style) for tourism negotiations. Conducted comparative experiments between pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs for the PAN-DG task.

Result: Automatic and manual evaluations confirmed high-quality dialogues in PACT dataset. Fine-tuned LLMs effectively generated personality-driven rational responses during negotiations, outperforming pre-trained models.

Conclusion: PACT dataset successfully enhances personalization and reasoning capabilities in negotiation dialogue systems, establishing a foundation for future research in personality-driven argumentation-based negotiation.

Abstract: Integrating argumentation mechanisms into negotiation dialogue systems
improves conflict resolution through exchanges of arguments and critiques.
Moreover, incorporating personality attributes enhances adaptability by
aligning interactions with individuals' preferences and styles. To advance
these capabilities in negotiation dialogue systems, we propose a novel
Personality-driven Argumentation-based Negotiation Dialogue Generation (PAN-DG)
task. To support this task, we introduce PACT, a dataset of Personality-driven
Argumentation-based negotiation Conversations for Tourism sector. This dataset,
generated using Large Language Models (LLMs), features three distinct
personality profiles, viz. Argumentation Profile, Preference Profile, and
Buying Style Profile to simulate a variety of negotiation scenarios involving
diverse personalities. Thorough automatic and manual evaluations indicate that
the dataset comprises high-quality dialogues. Further, we conduct comparative
experiments between pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs for the PAN-DG task.
Multi-dimensional evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned LLMs effectively
generate personality-driven rational responses during negotiations. This
underscores the effectiveness of PACT in enhancing personalization and
reasoning capabilities in negotiation dialogue systems, thereby establishing a
foundation for future research in this domain.

*Hongxu Zhou,Hylke Westerdijk,Khondoker Ittehadul Islam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adding context and emotional tone metadata to LLM prompts for fallacy classification in political debates often reduces performance, with emotional tone biasing models toward Appeal to Emotion fallacies and diluting attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how contextual information and emotional tone metadata affect LLM reasoning and performance in fallacy classification tasks, particularly in political debate settings where fallacies are common.

Method: Used Qwen-3 (8B) model with various prompting strategies on U.S. presidential debate data. Tested three input settings (text-only, text+context, text+context+emotional tone) and introduced two Chain-of-Thought frameworks: Pragma-Dialectics and Periodic Table of Arguments.

Result: Theoretical prompting improved interpretability but context and emotional tone metadata often lowered performance. Emotional tone metadata biased the model toward Appeal to Emotion fallacy classification and worsened logical reasoning. Basic prompts generally outperformed enhanced ones.

Conclusion: Attention dilution from added contextual inputs may worsen fallacy classification performance in LLMs, suggesting that simpler prompts without emotional tone metadata work better for logical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates how context and emotional tone metadata influence
large language model (LLM) reasoning and performance in fallacy classification
tasks, particularly within political debate settings. Using data from U.S.
presidential debates, we classify six fallacy types through various prompting
strategies applied to the Qwen-3 (8B) model. We introduce two theoretically
grounded Chain-of-Thought frameworks: Pragma-Dialectics and the Periodic Table
of Arguments, and evaluate their effectiveness against a baseline prompt under
three input settings: text-only, text with context, and text with both context
and audio-based emotional tone metadata. Results suggest that while theoretical
prompting can improve interpretability and, in some cases, accuracy, the
addition of context and especially emotional tone metadata often leads to
lowered performance. Emotional tone metadata biases the model toward labeling
statements as \textit{Appeal to Emotion}, worsening logical reasoning. Overall,
basic prompts often outperformed enhanced ones, suggesting that attention
dilution from added inputs may worsen rather than improve fallacy
classification in LLMs.

*Shiyao Cui,Xijia Feng,Yingkang Wang,Junxiao Yang,Zhexin Zhang,Biplab Sikdar,Hongning Wang,Han Qiu,Minlie Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emojis can trigger toxic content generation in LLMs by bypassing safety mechanisms, with experiments showing this effect across multiple languages and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The observation that emojis, typically associated with friendliness, may unexpectedly trigger toxic content generation in large language models.

Method: Automated construction of prompts with emojis to subtly express toxic intent, tested across 5 languages on 7 LLMs, with model-level interpretations including semantic cognition, sequence generation, and tokenization analysis.

Result: Prompts with emojis easily induce toxicity generation in LLMs, and analysis reveals emojis act as a heterogeneous semantic channel that bypasses safety mechanisms, with potential correlation to emoji-related data pollution in pre-training corpora.

Conclusion: Emojis can significantly enhance toxicity generation in LLMs by circumventing safety protections, highlighting a vulnerability in current safety mechanisms that requires attention.

Abstract: Emojis are globally used non-verbal cues in digital communication, and
extensive research has examined how large language models (LLMs) understand and
utilize emojis across contexts. While usually associated with friendliness or
playfulness, it is observed that emojis may trigger toxic content generation in
LLMs. Motivated by such a observation, we aim to investigate: (1) whether
emojis can clearly enhance the toxicity generation in LLMs and (2) how to
interpret this phenomenon. We begin with a comprehensive exploration of
emoji-triggered LLM toxicity generation by automating the construction of
prompts with emojis to subtly express toxic intent. Experiments across 5
mainstream languages on 7 famous LLMs along with jailbreak tasks demonstrate
that prompts with emojis could easily induce toxicity generation. To understand
this phenomenon, we conduct model-level interpretations spanning semantic
cognition, sequence generation and tokenization, suggesting that emojis can act
as a heterogeneous semantic channel to bypass the safety mechanisms. To pursue
deeper insights, we further probe the pre-training corpus and uncover potential
correlation between the emoji-related data polution with the toxicity
generation behaviors. Supplementary materials provide our implementation code
and data. (Warning: This paper contains potentially sensitive contents)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text2Mem introduces a unified memory operation language with standardized JSON-based schema for reliable execution of memory operations in LLM agents, addressing limitations of existing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory frameworks for LLM agents are limited, exposing only basic primitives while lacking higher-order operations and formal specifications, leading to unpredictable behavior across systems.

Method: Text2Mem defines a compact operation set with JSON-based schema instances, includes a parser for typed operation objects, validator for correctness, and adapters for SQL backends or real memory frameworks with integrated model services.

Result: The design ensures safety, determinism, and portability across heterogeneous backends through unified execution contracts and planned Text2Mem Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: Text2Mem establishes the first standardized foundation for memory control in agents, providing reliable execution from natural language to memory operations.

Abstract: Large language model agents increasingly depend on memory to sustain long
horizon interaction, but existing frameworks remain limited. Most expose only a
few basic primitives such as encode, retrieve, and delete, while higher order
operations like merge, promote, demote, split, lock, and expire are missing or
inconsistently supported. Moreover, there is no formal and executable
specification for memory commands, leaving scope and lifecycle rules implicit
and causing unpredictable behavior across systems. We introduce Text2Mem, a
unified memory operation language that provides a standardized pathway from
natural language to reliable execution. Text2Mem defines a compact yet
expressive operation set aligned with encoding, storage, and retrieval. Each
instruction is represented as a JSON based schema instance with required fields
and semantic invariants, which a parser transforms into typed operation objects
with normalized parameters. A validator ensures correctness before execution,
while adapters map typed objects either to a SQL prototype backend or to real
memory frameworks. Model based services such as embeddings or summarization are
integrated when required. All results are returned through a unified execution
contract. This design ensures safety, determinism, and portability across
heterogeneous backends. We also outline Text2Mem Bench, a planned benchmark
that separates schema generation from backend execution to enable systematic
evaluation. Together, these components establish the first standardized
foundation for memory control in agents.

*Erion Çano,Ivan Habernal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DP fine-tuning of LLMs significantly degrades text quality (length, grammar, diversity) and utility in downstream classification tasks as privacy constraints increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of differential privacy fine-tuning on LLM text quality and utility, which hasn't been studied despite the popularity of privacy-preserving LLM synthesis.

Method: Fine-tuned five LLMs with three corpora under four privacy levels, then assessed text length, grammatical correctness, lexical diversity, and utility in downstream classification tasks (book genre and cause of death recognition).

Result: Stronger privacy constraints led to texts that are at least 77% shorter, 9% less grammatically correct, and 10% less diverse. Downstream classification accuracy also decreased significantly.

Conclusion: Differential privacy fine-tuning substantially compromises both the quality and utility of LLM-generated synthetic data, potentially limiting its practical usefulness.

Abstract: Ensuring user privacy by synthesizing data from large language models (LLMs)
tuned under differential privacy (DP) has become popular recently. However, the
impact of DP fine-tuned LLMs on the quality of the language and the utility of
the texts they produce has not been investigated. In this work, we tune five
LLMs with three corpora under four levels of privacy and assess the length, the
grammatical correctness, and the lexical diversity of the text outputs they
produce. We also probe the utility of the synthetic outputs in downstream
classification tasks such as book genre recognition based on book descriptions
and cause of death recognition based on verbal autopsies. The results indicate
that LLMs tuned under stronger privacy constrains produce texts that are
shorter by at least 77 %, that are less grammatically correct by at least 9 %,
and are less diverse by at least 10 % in bi-gram diversity. Furthermore, the
accuracy they reach in downstream classification tasks decreases, which might
be detrimental to the usefulness of the generated synthetic data.

*Hang Guo,Yawei Li,Luca Benini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OBR is a training-free framework that combines quantization and sparsity to compress LLMs, achieving 4.72x speedup and 6.4x memory reduction through error compensation between conflicting compression techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single compression methods (quantization/pruning) are reaching their limits, but combining them creates conflicts - quantization prefers compact weight ranges while pruning benefits from high variance distributions.

Method: Optimal Brain Restoration (OBR) uses a second-order Hessian objective with surrogate approximation and group error compensation to align pruning and quantization without training.

Result: Enables aggressive W4A4KV4 quantization with 50% sparsity, achieving up to 4.72x speedup and 6.4x memory reduction compared to FP16-dense baseline.

Conclusion: OBR successfully addresses the conflicting requirements of joint quantization and sparsity through error compensation, providing significant compression benefits without performance degradation.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) compression, such as
quantization and pruning, have achieved notable success. However, as these
techniques gradually approach their respective limits, relying on a single
method for further compression has become increasingly challenging. In this
work, we explore an alternative solution by combining quantization and
sparsity. This joint approach, though promising, introduces new difficulties
due to the inherently conflicting requirements on weight distributions:
quantization favors compact ranges, while pruning benefits from high variance.
To attack this problem, we propose Optimal Brain Restoration (OBR), a general
and training-free framework that aligns pruning and quantization by error
compensation between both. OBR minimizes performance degradation on downstream
tasks by building on a second-order Hessian objective, which is then
reformulated into a tractable problem through surrogate approximation and
ultimately reaches a closed-form solution via group error compensation.
Experiments show that OBR enables aggressive W4A4KV4 quantization with 50%
sparsity on existing LLMs, and delivers up to 4.72x speedup and 6.4x memory
reduction compared to the FP16-dense baseline.

Motivation: Conventional adversarial training improves BioIE performance but introduces significant computational overhead, creating a need for more efficient solutions.

Method: Built on PubMedBERT, RAT integrates random sampling mechanisms with adversarial training principles to enhance model generalization and robustness while reducing computational requirements.

Result: RAT demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models in BioIE tasks, achieving better generalization and robustness with significantly lower computational costs.

Conclusion: RAT offers a transformative framework for biomedical NLP that effectively balances model performance with computational efficiency, making adversarial training more practical for BioIE applications.

Abstract: We introduce random adversarial training (RAT), a novel framework
successfully applied to biomedical information extraction (BioIE) tasks.
Building on PubMedBERT as the foundational architecture, our study first
validates the effectiveness of conventional adversarial training in enhancing
pre-trained language models' performance on BioIE tasks. While adversarial
training yields significant improvements across various performance metrics, it
also introduces considerable computational overhead. To address this
limitation, we propose RAT as an efficiency solution for biomedical information
extraction. This framework strategically integrates random sampling mechanisms
with adversarial training principles, achieving dual objectives: enhanced model
generalization and robustness while significantly reducing computational costs.
Through comprehensive evaluations, RAT demonstrates superior performance
compared to baseline models in BioIE tasks. The results highlight RAT's
potential as a transformative framework for biomedical natural language
processing, offering a balanced solution to the model performance and
computational efficiency.

Motivation: To reduce the cognitive burden and friction in prompt engineering for life sciences researchers by providing actionable guidelines from the extensive Prompt Report, enabling systematic and effective use of LLMs.

Method: The authors analyze and distill 58 prompt engineering techniques to focus on 6 core approaches: zero-shot, few-shot, thought generation, ensembling, self-criticism, and decomposition. They provide detailed recommendations and address common pitfalls.

Result: The paper provides comprehensive guidance on prompt structuring, addresses limitations of current LLM platforms, and demonstrates how prompt engineering can augment existing research practices in literature summarization, data extraction, and editorial tasks.

Conclusion: Effective prompt engineering can transition from opportunistic use to systematic practice, contributing to higher quality research in life sciences by providing actionable guidance on core principles while acknowledging current platform limitations.

Abstract: Developing effective prompts demands significant cognitive investment to
generate reliable, high-quality responses from Large Language Models (LLMs). By
deploying case-specific prompt engineering techniques that streamline
frequently performed life sciences workflows, researchers could achieve
substantial efficiency gains that far exceed the initial time investment
required to master these techniques. The Prompt Report published in 2025
outlined 58 different text-based prompt engineering techniques, highlighting
the numerous ways prompts could be constructed. To provide actionable
guidelines and reduce the friction of navigating these various approaches, we
distil this report to focus on 6 core techniques: zero-shot, few-shot
approaches, thought generation, ensembling, self-criticism, and decomposition.
We breakdown the significance of each approach and ground it in use cases
relevant to life sciences, from literature summarization and data extraction to
editorial tasks. We provide detailed recommendations for how prompts should and
shouldn't be structured, addressing common pitfalls including multi-turn
conversation degradation, hallucinations, and distinctions between reasoning
and non-reasoning models. We examine context window limitations, agentic tools
like Claude Code, while analyzing the effectiveness of Deep Research tools
across OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and Perplexity platforms, discussing current
limitations. We demonstrate how prompt engineering can augment rather than
replace existing established individual practices around data processing and
document editing. Our aim is to provide actionable guidance on core prompt
engineering principles, and to facilitate the transition from opportunistic
prompting to an effective, low-friction systematic practice that contributes to
higher quality research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Ko-PIQA is a Korean physical commonsense reasoning dataset with cultural context, created from 3.01M web questions filtered to 11,553 PIQA-style questions and refined to 441 high-quality pairs, featuring 19.7% culturally specific elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing physical commonsense reasoning datasets like PIQA are predominantly English-centric and lack cultural diversity, creating a need for culturally diverse benchmarks.

Method: Multi-stage filtering approach using three language models on 3.01M web-crawled questions, followed by GPT-4o refinement and human validation to create 441 high-quality Korean question-answer pairs with cultural context.

Result: Seven language models evaluated, with best achieving 83.22% accuracy and weakest at 59.86%. Models particularly struggle with culturally specific scenarios, showing significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: Ko-PIQA serves as both a benchmark for Korean language models and a foundation for more inclusive commonsense reasoning research, highlighting the importance of culturally diverse datasets.

Abstract: Physical commonsense reasoning datasets like PIQA are predominantly
English-centric and lack cultural diversity. We introduce Ko-PIQA, a Korean
physical commonsense reasoning dataset that incorporates cultural context.
Starting from 3.01 million web-crawled questions, we employed a multi-stage
filtering approach using three language models to identify 11,553 PIQA-style
questions. Through GPT-4o refinement and human validation, we obtained 441
high-quality question-answer pairs. A key feature of Ko-PIQA is its cultural
grounding: 19.7\% of questions contain culturally specific elements like
traditional Korean foods (kimchi), clothing (hanbok), and specialized
appliances (kimchi refrigerators) that require culturally-aware reasoning
beyond direct translation. We evaluate seven language models on Ko-PIQA, with
the best model achieving 83.22\% accuracy while the weakest reaches only
59.86\%, demonstrating significant room for improvement. Models particularly
struggle with culturally specific scenarios, highlighting the importance of
culturally diverse datasets. Ko-PIQA serves as both a benchmark for Korean
language models and a foundation for more inclusive commonsense reasoning
research. The dataset and code will be publicly available.

the AraHealthQA-2025 shared task, where our methodology secured 2nd place in
both Sub-Task 1 (multiple-choice question answering) and Sub-Task 2 (open-ended
question answering) in Arabic clinical contexts. For Sub-Task 1, we leverage
the Gemini 2.5 Flash model with few-shot prompting, dataset preprocessing, and
an ensemble of three prompt configurations to improve classification accuracy
on standard, biased, and fill-in-the-blank questions. For Sub-Task 2, we employ
a unified prompt with the same model, incorporating role-playing as an Arabic

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, R-BERT) significantly outperform non-transformer models (PA-LSTM, C-GCN, AGGCN) in relation extraction, achieving 80-90% micro F1 scores vs 64-67% for non-transformers across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically compare the performance of deep supervised learning approaches with and without transformers in relation extraction, and understand the impact of transformer architectures on this important NLP task.

Method: Used multiple non-transformer architectures (PA-LSTM, C-GCN, AGGCN) and transformer architectures (BERT, RoBERTa, R-BERT) evaluated on TACRED, TACREV, and RE-TACRED datasets with traditional metrics like micro F1, varying sentence lengths, and different training dataset percentages.

Result: Transformer-based models achieved significantly higher micro F1 scores (80-90%) compared to non-transformer models (64-67%), demonstrating superior performance across all evaluation scenarios.

Conclusion: Transformers substantially outperform traditional deep learning architectures in relation extraction tasks, highlighting their effectiveness in transforming unstructured text into structured data through relation classification.

Abstract: In the era of large language model, relation extraction (RE) plays an
important role in information extraction through the transformation of
unstructured raw text into structured data (Wadhwa et al., 2023). In this
paper, we systematically compare the performance of deep supervised learning
approaches without transformers and those with transformers. We used a series
of non-transformer architectures such as PA-LSTM(Zhang et al., 2017),
C-GCN(Zhang et al., 2018), and AGGCN(attention guide GCN)(Guo et al., 2019),
and a series of transformer architectures such as BERT, RoBERTa, and R-BERT(Wu
and He, 2019). Our comparison included traditional metrics like micro F1, as
well as evaluations in different scenarios, varying sentence lengths, and
different percentages of the dataset for training. Our experiments were
conducted on TACRED, TACREV, and RE-TACRED. The results show that
transformer-based models outperform non-transformer models, achieving micro F1
scores of 80-90% compared to 64-67% for non-transformer models. Additionally,
we briefly review the research journey in supervised relation classification
and discuss the role and current status of large language models (LLMs) in
relation extraction.

*Abraham Toluwase Owodunni,Sachin Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA) enables multilingual models to add new languages without catastrophic forgetting, using targeted low-rank adapters on initial and final layers while keeping intermediate layers frozen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual models require expensive retraining from scratch to add new languages, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when original pretraining data is unavailable.

Method: Proposes Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA) which adds Low-Rank Adapters to selected initial and final layers while freezing intermediate layers, based on insights about how multilingual models process languages across different layers.

Result: LayRA provides the best tradeoff between preserving existing language capabilities and learning new languages, outperforming approaches like standard LoRA, and enables instruction following in target languages without instruction tuning data.

Conclusion: LayRA offers an effective solution for continually expanding multilingual models to new languages while maintaining performance on previously supported languages, addressing the critical problem of catastrophic forgetting without access to original pretraining data.

Abstract: Multilingual language models are trained on a fixed set of languages, and to
support new languages, the models need to be retrained from scratch. This is an
expensive endeavor and is often infeasible, as model developers tend not to
release their pre-training data. Naive approaches, such as continued
pretraining, suffer from catastrophic forgetting; however, mitigation
strategies like experience replay cannot be applied due to the lack of original
pretraining data. In this work, we investigate the problem of continually
adding new languages to a multilingual model, assuming access to pretraining
data in only the target languages. We explore multiple approaches to address
this problem and propose Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA), which adds Low-Rank
Adapters (LoRA) to selected initial and final layers while keeping the rest of
the model frozen. LayRA builds on two insights: (1) LoRA reduces forgetting,
and (2) multilingual models encode inputs in the source language in the initial
layers, reason in English in intermediate layers, and translate back to the
source language in final layers. We experiment with adding multiple
combinations of Galician, Swahili, and Urdu to pretrained language models and
evaluate each method on diverse multilingual tasks. We find that LayRA provides
the overall best tradeoff between preserving models' capabilities in previously
supported languages, while being competitive with existing approaches such as
LoRA in learning new languages. We also demonstrate that using model
arithmetic, the adapted models can be equipped with strong instruction
following abilities without access to any instruction tuning data in the target
languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CEMTM is a context-enhanced multimodal topic model that processes text and images using fine-tuned vision language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multimodal benchmarks with a 2.61 average LLM score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing topic models struggle with multimodal data (text + images), especially handling multiple images per document efficiently while maintaining interpretability and semantic consistency across modalities.

Method: Uses fine-tuned large vision language models for contextualized embeddings, distributional attention mechanism for token-level weighting, and reconstruction objective to align topic-based representations with document embeddings.

Result: Outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines on six benchmarks, achieves 2.61 average LLM score, and demonstrates effectiveness in few-shot retrieval and capturing visually grounded semantics in scientific domains.

Conclusion: CEMTM provides an effective solution for coherent and interpretable topic modeling from multimodal documents, handling multiple images efficiently while maintaining strong performance across various applications.

Abstract: We introduce CEMTM, a context-enhanced multimodal topic model designed to
infer coherent and interpretable topic structures from both short and long
documents containing text and images. CEMTM builds on fine-tuned large vision
language models (LVLMs) to obtain contextualized embeddings, and employs a
distributional attention mechanism to weight token-level contributions to topic
inference. A reconstruction objective aligns topic-based representations with
the document embedding, encouraging semantic consistency across modalities.
Unlike existing approaches, CEMTM can process multiple images per document
without repeated encoding and maintains interpretability through explicit
word-topic and document-topic distributions. Extensive experiments on six
multimodal benchmarks show that CEMTM consistently outperforms unimodal and
multimodal baselines, achieving a remarkable average LLM score of 2.61. Further
analysis shows its effectiveness in downstream few-shot retrieval and its
ability to capture visually grounded semantics in complex domains such as
scientific articles.

*Zhongyang Hu,Naijie Gu,Xiangzhi Tao,Tianhui Gu,Yibing Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes two methods for ranking candidate words in lexical substitution tasks: one using attention weights and another using integrated gradients to measure context-target influence and semantic similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for lexical substitution ranking focus only on semantic changes at target position or require parameter tuning across metrics, failing to effectively model the bidirectional influence between candidate substitutions and context.

Method: Two approaches: 1) attention-based method measuring context token influence on target token, 2) integrated gradients method for more interpretable influence measurement. Both incorporate semantic similarity between original and substituted sentences for candidate ranking.

Result: Experiments on LS07 and SWORDS datasets show both approaches improve ranking performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed attention and integrated gradients methods effectively capture bidirectional context-candidate influence and semantic variation, leading to improved lexical substitution ranking performance.

Abstract: A key subtask in lexical substitution is ranking the given candidate words. A
common approach is to replace the target word with a candidate in the original
sentence and feed the modified sentence into a model to capture semantic
differences before and after substitution. However, effectively modeling the
bidirectional influence of candidate substitution on both the target word and
its context remains challenging. Existing methods often focus solely on
semantic changes at the target position or rely on parameter tuning over
multiple evaluation metrics, making it difficult to accurately characterize
semantic variation. To address this, we investigate two approaches: one based
on attention weights and another leveraging the more interpretable integrated
gradients method, both designed to measure the influence of context tokens on
the target token and to rank candidates by incorporating semantic similarity
between the original and substituted sentences. Experiments on the LS07 and
SWORDS datasets demonstrate that both approaches improve ranking performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LVLMs struggle with understanding collaborative referring expressions in spontaneous conversations and show no improvement from overhearing repeated interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how well large vision-language models can understand collaborative referring expressions that emerge in spontaneous human conversations, which is crucial for embodied agents to perform real-world tasks.

Method: Tested seven state-of-the-art LVLMs on a corpus of spontaneous conversations between human pairs performing collaborative object-matching tasks, analyzing their performance as overhearers across multiple conversation rounds.

Result: Current LVLMs find this task challenging and fail to show consistent performance improvement even after overhearing multiple conversations between the same participants repeating the same task.

Conclusion: Understanding collaborative referring expressions remains a significant challenge for LVLMs, highlighting the need for better integration of language, vision, and conversational context in these models.

Abstract: During spontaneous conversations, speakers collaborate on novel referring
expressions, which they can then re-use in subsequent conversations.
Understanding such referring expressions is an important ability for an
embodied agent, so that it can carry out tasks in the real world. This requires
integrating and understanding language, vision, and conversational interaction.
We study the capabilities of seven state-of-the-art Large Vision Language
Models (LVLMs) as overhearers to a corpus of spontaneous conversations between
pairs of human discourse participants engaged in a collaborative
object-matching task. We find that such a task remains challenging for current
LVLMs and they all fail to show a consistent performance improvement as they
overhear more conversations from the same discourse participants repeating the
same task for multiple rounds. We release our corpus and code for
reproducibility and to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates medical LLMs on Spanish medical questions from Peru, creates PeruMedQA dataset, and shows that fine-tuned smaller models can compete with much larger models in medical QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether high performance of medical LLMs transfers to Spanish medical questions from Latin America, particularly Peru, as LLM-based medical applications become more prevalent in the region.

Method: Curated PeruMedQA dataset with 8,380 Spanish medical questions, tested 8 medical LLMs using zero-shot prompts, and fine-tuned medgemma-4b-it using PEFT and LoRA techniques.

Result: medgemma-27b-text-it achieved >90% accuracy, smaller models (<10B parameters) performed poorly (<60%), but fine-tuned medgemma-4b-it outperformed all smaller models and rivaled a 70B parameter model.

Conclusion: For Spanish medical applications in countries with similar epidemiology to Peru, use medgemma-27b-text-it or fine-tuned medgemma-4b-it rather than smaller vanilla models.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Medical large language models (LLMS) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in answering medical examinations. However, the extent to which
this high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from
a Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as
LLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a
dataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians
pursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate
and compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the
fine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice
question-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12
medical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including
medgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific
prompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient
fine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it
utilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS:
medgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of
correct answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion
parameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results
<50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all
LLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters
across various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and
research that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those
exhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties
should utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it.

### [194] [On the Distinctive Co-occurrence Characteristics of Antonymy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11534)
*Zhihan Cao,Hiroaki Yamada,Takenobu Tokunaga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Antonymy shows distinctive co-occurrence patterns with high strength, preferred linear order, and short spans compared to other semantic relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies showed antonym pairs frequently co-occur in text, but it was unclear if this pattern is distinctive to antonymy due to lack of comparison with other semantic relations.

Method: Compared antonymy with three other semantic relations across parts of speech using robust co-occurrence metrics.

Result: Antonymy is distinctive in three respects: high co-occurrence strength, preferred linear order, and occurrence within short spans.

Conclusion: Antonymy has unique co-occurrence characteristics that distinguish it from other semantic relations, with all results available online.

Abstract: Antonymy has long received particular attention in lexical semantics.
Previous studies have shown that antonym pairs frequently co-occur in text,
across genres and parts of speech, more often than would be expected by chance.
However, whether this co-occurrence pattern is distinctive of antonymy remains
unclear, due to a lack of comparison with other semantic relations. This work
fills the gap by comparing antonymy with three other relations across parts of
speech using robust co-occurrence metrics. We find that antonymy is distinctive
in three respects: antonym pairs co-occur with high strength, in a preferred
linear order, and within short spans. All results are available online.

*Junjie Hu,Gang Tu,ShengYu Cheng,Jinxin Li,Jinting Wang,Rui Chen,Zhilong Zhou,Dongbo Shan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HARP is a novel hallucination detection framework that decomposes LLM hidden states into semantic and reasoning subspaces using SVD on unembedding layer parameters, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 92.8% AUROC on TriviaQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination detection methods struggle with disentangling semantic and reasoning information and maintaining robustness, posing barriers to reliable LLM use in critical decision-making.

Method: HARP decomposes LLM hidden state space into semantic and reasoning subspaces using SVD on unembedding layer parameters, then projects hidden states onto reasoning subspace basis vectors for hallucination detection.

Result: HARP achieves 92.8% AUROC on TriviaQA, outperforming previous best method by 7.5%, reduces feature dimension to ~5% of original, and filters out noise for enhanced robustness.

Conclusion: HARP provides an effective framework for hallucination detection by leveraging subspace decomposition and projection, demonstrating superior performance and robustness across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a major barrier to their
reliable use in critical decision-making. Although existing hallucination
detection methods have improved accuracy, they still struggle with
disentangling semantic and reasoning information and maintaining robustness. To
address these challenges, we propose HARP (Hallucination detection via
reasoning subspace projection), a novel hallucination detection framework. HARP
establishes that the hidden state space of LLMs can be decomposed into a direct
sum of a semantic subspace and a reasoning subspace, where the former encodes
linguistic expression and the latter captures internal reasoning processes.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the Unembedding layer can disentangle these
subspaces, and by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to its
parameters, the basis vectors spanning the semantic and reasoning subspaces are
obtained. Finally, HARP projects hidden states onto the basis vectors of the
reasoning subspace, and the resulting projections are then used as input
features for hallucination detection in LLMs. By using these projections, HARP
reduces the dimension of the feature to approximately 5% of the original,
filters out most noise, and achieves enhanced robustness. Experiments across
multiple datasets show that HARP achieves state-of-the-art hallucination
detection performance; in particular, it achieves an AUROC of 92.8% on
TriviaQA, outperforming the previous best method by 7.5%.

*Wensheng Lu,Keyu Chen,Ruizhi Qiao,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiCBench is a new benchmark for evaluating document chunking in RAG systems, addressing evidence sparsity issues in existing benchmarks, and HiChunk is a multi-level document structuring framework that improves RAG performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG evaluation benchmarks are inadequate for assessing document chunking quality due to evidence sparsity, creating a need for better evaluation tools.

Method: Proposed HiCBench with manually annotated multi-level chunking points and synthesized evidence-dense QA pairs, plus HiChunk framework using fine-tuned LLMs and Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm.

Result: HiCBench effectively evaluates different chunking methods across RAG pipeline, and HiChunk achieves better chunking quality with reasonable time consumption.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and framework successfully address document chunking evaluation challenges and improve overall RAG system performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the response capabilities of
language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, document
chunking as an important part of RAG system often lacks effective evaluation
tools. This paper first analyzes why existing RAG evaluation benchmarks are
inadequate for assessing document chunking quality, specifically due to
evidence sparsity. Based on this conclusion, we propose HiCBench, which
includes manually annotated multi-level document chunking points, synthesized
evidence-dense quetion answer(QA) pairs, and their corresponding evidence
sources. Additionally, we introduce the HiChunk framework, a multi-level
document structuring framework based on fine-tuned LLMs, combined with the
Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm to improve retrieval quality. Experiments
demonstrate that HiCBench effectively evaluates the impact of different
chunking methods across the entire RAG pipeline. Moreover, HiChunk achieves
better chunking quality within reasonable time consumption, thereby enhancing
the overall performance of RAG systems.

### [197] [D$^2$HScore: Reasoning-Aware Hallucination Detection via Semantic Breadth and Depth Analysis in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11569)
*Yue Ding,Xiaofang Zhu,Tianze Xia,Junfei Wu,Xinlong Chen,Qiang Liu,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: D²HScore is a training-free hallucination detection framework that analyzes intra-layer dispersion and inter-layer drift of token representations in LLMs, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM hallucination hinders practical applications in high-stakes domains. Current detection methods need training data or labels, limiting scalability.

Method: Leverages LLM architecture and generation dynamics: 1) Intra-layer dispersion measures semantic diversity within layers 2) Inter-layer drift tracks concept evolution across layers using attention-guided token selection

Result: Extensive experiments on 5 LLMs and 5 benchmarks show D²HScore consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides interpretable, lightweight hallucination detection without training data, capturing both horizontal and vertical representation dynamics.

Abstract: Although large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their
practical application is often hindered by the generation of non-factual
content, which is called "hallucination". Ensuring the reliability of LLMs'
outputs is a critical challenge, particularly in high-stakes domains such as
finance, security, and healthcare. In this work, we revisit hallucination
detection from the perspective of model architecture and generation dynamics.
Leveraging the multi-layer structure and autoregressive decoding process of
LLMs, we decompose hallucination signals into two complementary dimensions: the
semantic breadth of token representations within each layer, and the semantic
depth of core concepts as they evolve across layers. Based on this insight, we
propose \textbf{D$^2$HScore (Dispersion and Drift-based Hallucination Score)},
a training-free and label-free framework that jointly measures: (1)
\textbf{Intra-Layer Dispersion}, which quantifies the semantic diversity of
token representations within each layer; and (2) \textbf{Inter-Layer Drift},
which tracks the progressive transformation of key token representations across
layers. To ensure drift reflects the evolution of meaningful semantics rather
than noisy or redundant tokens, we guide token selection using attention
signals. By capturing both the horizontal and vertical dynamics of
representation during inference, D$^2$HScore provides an interpretable and
lightweight proxy for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across
five open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
D$^2$HScore consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines.

*Sampoorna Poria,Xiaolei Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Survey of NLP progress and challenges for South Asian languages, highlighting data gaps, lack of benchmarks, and need for equitable representation in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have advanced English NLP but overlooked low-resource South Asian languages (650+ languages), creating a need to assess current capabilities and challenges to inform the NLP community.

Method: Comprehensive examination of studies since 2020, focusing on transformer-based models (BERT, T5, GPT) across three aspects: data, models, and tasks including available data sources, fine-tuning strategies, and domain applications.

Result: Identified substantial issues including missing data in critical domains (e.g., health), code-mixing challenges, and lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks tailored to South Asian linguistic and cultural nuances.

Conclusion: The survey aims to raise awareness for targeted data curation, unified benchmarks, and equitable representation of South Asian languages in NLP development to address current gaps and challenges.

Abstract: Rapid developments of large language models have revolutionized many NLP
tasks for English data. Unfortunately, the models and their evaluations for
low-resource languages are being overlooked, especially for languages in South
Asia. Although there are more than 650 languages in South Asia, many of them
either have very limited computational resources or are missing from existing
language models. Thus, a concrete question to be answered is: Can we assess the
current stage and challenges to inform our NLP community and facilitate model
developments for South Asian languages? In this survey, we have comprehensively
examined current efforts and challenges of NLP models for South Asian languages
by retrieving studies since 2020, with a focus on transformer-based models,
such as BERT, T5, & GPT. We present advances and gaps across 3 essential
aspects: data, models, & tasks, such as available data sources, fine-tuning
strategies, & domain applications. Our findings highlight substantial issues,
including missing data in critical domains (e.g., health), code-mixing, and
lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Our survey aims to raise awareness
within the NLP community for more targeted data curation, unify benchmarks
tailored to cultural and linguistic nuances of South Asia, and encourage an
equitable representation of South Asian languages. The complete list of

*Xiaoying Song,Anirban Saha Anik,Eduardo Blanco,Vanessa Frias-Martinez,Lingzi Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a novel metric and fusion-based method for maintaining stylistic consistency in crisis communication AI responses, outperforming baselines in quality and style uniformity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the overlooked but critical need for stylistic consistency in AI-generated crisis responses to maintain trust with affected populations.

Method: Two-stage fusion-based approach: first assesses candidate response styles, then optimizes and integrates them through instance-level fusion to reduce stylistic variation.

Result: Experimental results across multiple datasets show the approach consistently outperforms baselines in both response quality and stylistic uniformity.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses stylistic consistency in crisis communication AI, enabling high-quality responses with reduced stylistic variation between instances.

Abstract: In response to the urgent need for effective communication with
crisis-affected populations, automated responses driven by language models have
been proposed to assist in crisis communications. A critical yet often
overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the
trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few
studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across
generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for
evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach
grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first
assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates
them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the
generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic
variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both
response quality and stylistic uniformity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of 7,077 user interactions with TALKA AI chatbot shows how generative AI can effectively support Hakka language learning through cognitive engagement and dialogue act patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To preserve endangered languages like Hakka using technology and understand how AI chatbots can support language learning through cognitive and pragmatic analysis.

Method: Dual-layered analytical framework combining Bloom's Taxonomy (6 cognitive levels) and dialogue act categorization (11 types) applied to 7,077 annotated user utterances.

Result: Generative AI chatbots effectively support language learning by aligning dialogue acts with cognitive intentions, helping learners express confidently and connect with cultural identity.

Conclusion: AI-mediated dialogue facilitates cognitive development, pragmatic negotiation, and socio-cultural affiliation in low-resource language learners, offering valuable insights for language preservation.

Abstract: With many endangered languages at risk of disappearing, efforts to preserve
them now rely more than ever on using technology alongside culturally informed
teaching strategies. This study examines user behaviors in TALKA, a generative
AI-powered chatbot designed for Hakka language engagement, by employing a
dual-layered analytical framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy of cognitive
processes and dialogue act categorization. We analyzed 7,077 user utterances,
each carefully annotated according to six cognitive levels and eleven dialogue
act types. These included a variety of functions, such as asking for
information, requesting translations, making cultural inquiries, and using
language creatively. Pragmatic classifications further highlight how different
types of dialogue acts--such as feedback, control commands, and social
greetings--align with specific cognitive intentions. The results suggest that
generative AI chatbots can support language learning in meaningful
ways--especially when they are designed with an understanding of how users
think and communicate. They may also help learners express themselves more
confidently and connect with their cultural identity. The TALKA case provides
empirical insights into how AI-mediated dialogue facilitates cognitive
development in low-resource language learners, as well as pragmatic negotiation
and socio-cultural affiliation. By focusing on AI-assisted language learning,
this study offers new insights into how technology can support language
preservation and educational practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework using RAG with RL to generate health misinformation counterspeech tailored to different literacy levels, outperforming uniform response approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Health misinformation online threatens public health, and existing counterspeech methods produce uniform responses that ignore audience health literacy levels, affecting accessibility and effectiveness.

Method: Controlled-Literacy framework combining retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels and optimize counterspeech using reward functions with user preferences and readability metrics.

Result: Experiment results show Controlled-Literacy outperforms baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech tailored to different health literacy levels.

Conclusion: This research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech to health misinformation.

Abstract: Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public
health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating
counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing
approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy
level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of
counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In
particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels,
enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a
reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective
readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health
literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms
baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This
research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health
communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech
to health misinformation

*Md. Mithun Hossain,Sanjara,Md. Shakil Hossain,Sudipto Chaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpanEIT is a novel framework for entity-level sentiment classification that uses dynamic span interaction and graph-aware memory to better model entity-sentiment relationships, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entity-level sentiment classification faces challenges in modeling complex entity-sentiment interactions, cross-sentence dependencies, and maintaining consistency across entity mentions, especially with linguistic complexities like negation and ambiguity in noisy real-world text.

Method: SpanEIT builds span-based representations for entities and sentiment phrases, uses bidirectional attention for fine-grained interactions, employs graph attention networks for syntactic relations, and includes a coreference-aware memory module for entity consistency.

Result: Experiments on FSAD, BARU, and IMDB datasets show SpanEIT outperforms state-of-the-art transformer and hybrid baselines in both accuracy and F1 scores, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its components.

Conclusion: The proposed SpanEIT framework effectively addresses the challenges of entity-level sentiment classification and shows strong potential for applications in social media monitoring and customer feedback analysis.

Abstract: Entity-level sentiment classification involves identifying the sentiment
polarity linked to specific entities within text. This task poses several
challenges: effectively modeling the subtle and complex interactions between
entities and their surrounding sentiment expressions; capturing dependencies
that may span across sentences; and ensuring consistent sentiment predictions
for multiple mentions of the same entity through coreference resolution.
Additionally, linguistic phenomena such as negation, ambiguity, and overlapping
opinions further complicate the analysis. These complexities make entity-level
sentiment classification a difficult problem, especially in real-world, noisy
textual data. To address these issues, we propose SpanEIT, a novel framework
integrating dynamic span interaction and graph-aware memory mechanisms for
enhanced entity-sentiment relational modeling. SpanEIT builds span-based
representations for entities and candidate sentiment phrases, employs
bidirectional attention for fine-grained interactions, and uses a graph
attention network to capture syntactic and co-occurrence relations. A
coreference-aware memory module ensures entity-level consistency across
documents. Experiments on FSAD, BARU, and IMDB datasets show SpanEIT
outperforms state-of-the-art transformer and hybrid baselines in accuracy and
F1 scores. Ablation and interpretability analyses validate the effectiveness of
our approach, underscoring its potential for fine-grained sentiment analysis in
applications like social media monitoring and customer feedback analysis.

Result: HalluDetect achieved 69% F1 score (25.44% improvement over baselines). AgentBot minimized hallucinations to 0.4159 per turn with 96.13% token accuracy.

Conclusion: Optimized inference strategies can significantly improve factual accuracy in LLMs. The approach provides a scalable framework for hallucination mitigation that generalizes to high-risk domains beyond consumer law.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in industry but remain prone to
hallucinations, limiting their reliability in critical applications. This work
addresses hallucination reduction in consumer grievance chatbots built using
LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, a compact model frequently used in industry. We develop
HalluDetect, an LLM-based hallucination detection system that achieves an F1
score of 69% outperforming baseline detectors by 25.44%. Benchmarking five
chatbot architectures, we find that out of them, AgentBot minimizes
hallucinations to 0.4159 per turn while maintaining the highest token accuracy
(96.13%), making it the most effective mitigation strategy. Our findings
provide a scalable framework for hallucination mitigation, demonstrating that
optimized inference strategies can significantly improve factual accuracy.
While applied to consumer law, our approach generalizes to other high-risk
domains, enhancing trust in LLM-driven assistants. We will release the code and

TL;DR: AesBiasBench benchmark evaluates MLLMs for stereotype bias and human alignment in personalized image aesthetic assessment across demographic groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs are increasingly used for personalized image aesthetic assessment but may reflect subtle demographic biases in their predictions, requiring systematic evaluation.

Method: Proposed AesBiasBench with three subtasks (Aesthetic Perception, Assessment, Empathy) and structured metrics (IFD, NRD, AAS) to evaluate 19 MLLMs including proprietary and open-source models.

Result: Smaller models show stronger stereotype biases, larger models align better with human preferences. Identity information often increases bias, especially in emotional judgments.

Conclusion: Identity-aware evaluation frameworks are crucial for subjective vision-language tasks to address demographic biases in MLLM aesthetic assessments.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
Personalized Image Aesthetic Assessment (PIAA) as a scalable alternative to
expert evaluations. However, their predictions may reflect subtle biases
influenced by demographic factors such as gender, age, and education. In this
work, we propose AesBiasBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs along two
complementary dimensions: (1) stereotype bias, quantified by measuring
variations in aesthetic evaluations across demographic groups; and (2)
alignment between model outputs and genuine human aesthetic preferences. Our
benchmark covers three subtasks (Aesthetic Perception, Assessment, Empathy) and
introduces structured metrics (IFD, NRD, AAS) to assess both bias and
alignment. We evaluate 19 MLLMs, including proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o,
Claude-3.5-Sonnet) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL-2.5, Qwen2.5-VL).
Results indicate that smaller models exhibit stronger stereotype biases,
whereas larger models align more closely with human preferences. Incorporating
identity information often exacerbates bias, particularly in emotional
judgments. These findings underscore the importance of identity-aware
evaluation frameworks in subjective vision-language tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks don't adequately capture the unique ethical dilemmas in mental health practice where confidentiality, autonomy, beneficence, and bias intersect, creating a need for specialized evaluation tools.

Method: Created a pilot dataset of 125 ethically charged mental health scenarios with structured fields including decision options, expert-aligned reasoning, expected behavior, real-world impact, and multi-stakeholder viewpoints.

Result: Developed EthicsMH dataset that enables evaluation of both decision accuracy and explanation quality while aligning with professional mental health norms, though modest in scale and using model-assisted generation.

Conclusion: EthicsMH establishes a framework bridging AI ethics and mental health decision-making, providing a seed resource for community expansion to develop AI systems capable of handling delicate mental health decisions responsibly.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in mental health and other
sensitive domains raises urgent questions about ethical reasoning, fairness,
and responsible alignment. Yet, existing benchmarks for moral and clinical
decision-making do not adequately capture the unique ethical dilemmas
encountered in mental health practice, where confidentiality, autonomy,
beneficence, and bias frequently intersect. To address this gap, we introduce
Ethical Reasoning in Mental Health (EthicsMH), a pilot dataset of 125 scenarios
designed to evaluate how AI systems navigate ethically charged situations in
therapeutic and psychiatric contexts. Each scenario is enriched with structured
fields, including multiple decision options, expert-aligned reasoning, expected
model behavior, real-world impact, and multi-stakeholder viewpoints. This
structure enables evaluation not only of decision accuracy but also of
explanation quality and alignment with professional norms. Although modest in
scale and developed with model-assisted generation, EthicsMH establishes a task
framework that bridges AI ethics and mental health decision-making. By
releasing this dataset, we aim to provide a seed resource that can be expanded
through community and expert contributions, fostering the development of AI
systems capable of responsibly handling some of society's most delicate
decisions.

TL;DR: DYNAMO is a fake news detection model that uses knowledge graphs and Monte Carlo Tree Search to continuously update knowledge and verify news authenticity through step-by-step decomposition and verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid evolution of internet and social media makes distinguishing credible news challenging due to shifting authenticity labels and the need for latest event updates. Existing methods suffer from insufficient credibility of retrieved content and noise interference.

Method: Constructs news-domain-specific knowledge graph, uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to decompose complex news for step-by-step verification, extracts and updates new knowledge from verified real news texts and reasoning paths, integrates with large language models for dual functions of detection and verification.

Result: DYNAMO achieves the best performance on two real-world datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic knowledge update-driven approach effectively solves key problems of ensuring new knowledge authenticity and deeply mining news semantics, demonstrating superior performance in fake news detection.

Abstract: As the Internet and social media evolve rapidly, distinguishing credible news
from a vast amount of complex information poses a significant challenge. Due to
the suddenness and instability of news events, the authenticity labels of news
can potentially shift as events develop, making it crucial for fake news
detection to obtain the latest event updates. Existing methods employ
retrieval-augmented generation to fill knowledge gaps, but they suffer from
issues such as insufficient credibility of retrieved content and interference
from noisy information. We propose a dynamic knowledge update-driven model for
fake news detection (DYNAMO), which leverages knowledge graphs to achieve
continuous updating of new knowledge and integrates with large language models
to fulfill dual functions: news authenticity detection and verification of new
knowledge correctness, solving the two key problems of ensuring the
authenticity of new knowledge and deeply mining news semantics. Specifically,
we first construct a news-domain-specific knowledge graph. Then, we use Monte
Carlo Tree Search to decompose complex news and verify them step by step.
Finally, we extract and update new knowledge from verified real news texts and
reasoning paths. Experimental results demonstrate that DYNAMO achieves the best
performance on two real-world datasets.

TL;DR: CoachMe is a reference-based model that analyzes differences between learner's motion and reference motion to provide precise sport-specific instructions, outperforming GPT-4o by significant margins in figure skating and boxing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion instruction is crucial for athletes but challenging due to domain-specific nature of sports and need for informative guidance. Current multimodal models lack precision in sport-specific instruction.

Method: Reference-based model that analyzes differences between learner's motion and reference motion under temporal and physical aspects, enabling domain-knowledge learning and coach-like thinking process.

Result: Outperforms GPT-4o by 31.6% in G-Eval on figure skating and by 58.3% on boxing. Provides high-quality instructions with detailed error analysis and improvement methods.

Conclusion: CoachMe effectively adapts to specific sports by learning from general movements and leveraging limited data, providing precise and informative motion instructions that go beyond generic coaching tone.

Abstract: Motion instruction is a crucial task that helps athletes refine their
technique by analyzing movements and providing corrective guidance. Although
recent advances in multimodal models have improved motion understanding,
generating precise and sport-specific instruction remains challenging due to
the highly domain-specific nature of sports and the need for informative
guidance. We propose CoachMe, a reference-based model that analyzes the
differences between a learner's motion and a reference under temporal and
physical aspects. This approach enables both domain-knowledge learning and the
acquisition of a coach-like thinking process that identifies movement errors
effectively and provides feedback to explain how to improve. In this paper, we
illustrate how CoachMe adapts well to specific sports such as skating and
boxing by learning from general movements and then leveraging limited data.
Experiments show that CoachMe provides high-quality instructions instead of
directions merely in the tone of a coach but without critical information.
CoachMe outperforms GPT-4o by 31.6% in G-Eval on figure skating and by 58.3% on
boxing. Analysis further confirms that it elaborates on errors and their
corresponding improvement methods in the generated instructions. You can find

TL;DR: This pilot study examines how room acoustic improvements in a seminar room affect communication quality in hybrid meetings, finding that acoustic interventions appear to enhance communicative success despite small sample size limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of hybrid meetings since COVID-19, acoustic design is often overlooked despite poor acoustics causing issues like misunderstandings, reduced speech intelligibility, and fatigue. The study addresses this gap by investigating whether acoustic interventions can improve communication in hybrid meeting spaces.

Method: The researchers recorded two groups of participants twice - once before and once after implementing acoustic improvements in a seminar room at Graz University of Technology. They compared communication outcomes between the pre- and post-intervention conditions.

Result: The findings indicate that the room acoustic interventions improved communicative success in hybrid meetings, though the results did not reach statistical significance due to the small sample size of this pilot study.

Conclusion: Acoustic design interventions show promise for enhancing communication in hybrid meeting environments, highlighting the importance of considering room acoustics alongside technical infrastructure like internet connectivity for effective hybrid meeting spaces.

Abstract: Since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, universities and companies have
increasingly integrated hybrid features into their meeting spaces, or even
created dedicated rooms for this purpose. While the importance of a fast and
stable internet connection is often prioritized, the acoustic design of seminar
rooms is frequently overlooked. Poor acoustics, particularly excessive
reverberation, can lead to issues such as misunderstandings, reduced speech
intelligibility or cognitive and vocal fatigue. This pilot study investigates
whether room acoustic interventions in a seminar room at Graz University of
Technology support better communication in hybrid meetings. For this purpose,
we recorded two groups of persons twice, once before and once after improving
the acoustics of the room. Our findings -- despite not reaching statistical
significance due to the small sample size - indicate clearly that our spatial
interventions improve communicative success in hybrid meetings. To make the
paper accessible also for readers from the speech communication community, we
explain room acoustics background, relevant for the interpretation of our
results.

*Gaye Colakoglu,Gürkan Solmaz,Jonathan Fürst*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A stateful agentic system for extracting key-value pairs from diverse Declaration of Performance documents using planner-executor-responder architecture to handle structural variations and avoid hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EU-mandated DoP documents vary widely in layout, language, schema, and format, making automated extraction challenging. Existing static or LLM-only pipelines hallucinate and fail to adapt to structural diversity.

Method: Domain-specific stateful agentic system with planner-executor-responder architecture that infers user intent, detects document modality, and orchestrates tools dynamically for robust, traceable reasoning.

Result: Improved robustness across formats and languages on a curated DoP dataset, demonstrating scalable structured data extraction for regulated workflows.

Conclusion: The proposed agentic system effectively addresses structural diversity in DoP documents, providing traceable reasoning and avoiding tool misuse while offering a scalable solution for regulated construction product workflows.

Abstract: Declaration of Performance (DoP) documents, mandated by EU regulation,
certify the performance of construction products. While some of their content
is standardized, DoPs vary widely in layout, language, schema, and format,
posing challenges for automated key-value pair extraction (KVP) and question
answering (QA). Existing static or LLM-only IE pipelines often hallucinate and
fail to adapt to this structural diversity. Our domain-specific, stateful
agentic system addresses these challenges through a planner-executor-responder
architecture. The system infers user intent, detects document modality, and
orchestrates tools dynamically for robust, traceable reasoning while avoiding
tool misuse or execution loops. Evaluation on a curated DoP dataset
demonstrates improved robustness across formats and languages, offering a
scalable solution for structured data extraction in regulated workflows.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UXPID dataset: 7130 synthetic forum feedback branches for AI-driven UX analysis in industrial automation, addressing privacy constraints with LLM-annotated insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial forums contain valuable but unstructured user feedback that traditional methods struggle to analyze due to domain-specific vocabulary and lack of structure, limiting product development insights.

Method: Created UXPID dataset with 7130 artificially synthesized and anonymized JSON records from industrial automation forums, using LLM analysis to annotate UX insights, expectations, severity, sentiment, and topics.

Result: A structured dataset enabling research in user requirements, UX analysis, and AI-driven feedback processing, particularly useful where privacy restrictions limit real data access.

Conclusion: UXPID facilitates training transformer models for issue detection, sentiment analysis, and requirements extraction in technical forums, bridging the gap between unstructured feedback and systematic analysis.

Abstract: Customer feedback in industrial forums reflect a rich but underexplored
source of insight into real-world product experience. These publicly shared
discussions offer an organic view of user expectations, frustrations, and
success stories shaped by the specific contexts of use. Yet, harnessing this
information for systematic analysis remains challenging due to the unstructured
and domain-specific nature of the content. The lack of structure and
specialized vocabulary makes it difficult for traditional data analysis
techniques to accurately interpret, categorize, and quantify the feedback,
thereby limiting its potential to inform product development and support
strategies. To address these challenges, this paper presents the User
eXperience Perception Insights Dataset (UXPID), a collection of 7130
artificially synthesized and anonymized user feedback branches extracted from a
public industrial automation forum. Each JavaScript object notation (JSON)
record contains multi-post comments related to specific hardware and software
products, enriched with metadata and contextual conversation data. Leveraging a
large language model (LLM), each branch is systematically analyzed and
annotated for UX insights, user expectations, severity and sentiment ratings,
and topic classifications. The UXPID dataset is designed to facilitate research
in user requirements, user experience (UX) analysis, and AI-driven feedback
processing, particularly where privacy and licensing restrictions limit access
to real-world data. UXPID supports the training and evaluation of
transformer-based models for tasks such as issue detection, sentiment analysis,
and requirements extraction in the context of technical forums.

*Dvora Goncharok,Arbel Shifman,Alexander Apartsin,Yehudit Aperstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel annotated dataset of medication-related questions from online forums, labeled for clinical criticality, and benchmarks traditional ML classifiers against LLM-based approaches for detecting critical health questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online medical forums contain valuable patient insights about medication concerns, where critical questions may signal confusion, misuse, or early warning signs of health crises that require timely intervention to improve patient safety.

Method: Created a manually annotated dataset of medication-related questions labeled by clinical risk factors. Compared six traditional ML classifiers using TF-IDF features against three state-of-the-art LLM-based classification approaches leveraging deep contextual understanding.

Result: The study demonstrates the potential of both classical machine learning methods and modern LLM approaches to support real-time triage and alert systems for detecting critical medication-related questions in digital health spaces.

Conclusion: The curated dataset is publicly available to encourage further research at the intersection of patient-generated data, NLP, and early warning systems for critical health events, highlighting the value of automated detection systems for medication safety.

Abstract: Online medical forums are a rich and underutilized source of insight into
patient concerns, especially regarding medication use. Some of the many
questions users pose may signal confusion, misuse, or even the early warning
signs of a developing health crisis. Detecting these critical questions that
may precede severe adverse events or life-threatening complications is vital
for timely intervention and improving patient safety. This study introduces a
novel annotated dataset of medication-related questions extracted from online
forums. Each entry is manually labelled for criticality based on clinical risk
factors. We benchmark the performance of six traditional machine learning
classifiers using TF-IDF textual representations, alongside three
state-of-the-art large language model (LLM)-based classification approaches
that leverage deep contextual understanding. Our results highlight the
potential of classical and modern methods to support real-time triage and alert
systems in digital health spaces. The curated dataset is made publicly
available to encourage further research at the intersection of
patient-generated data, natural language processing, and early warning systems
for critical health events. The dataset and benchmark are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A synthetic dataset called Noisy Diagnostic Benchmark (NDB) is created to test LLMs' ability to interpret noisy, informal patient narratives with varying linguistic noise and layperson terminology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks use clean clinical text, but real patient descriptions are often informal, ambiguous, and noisy, creating a gap in understanding LLM performance under realistic healthcare conditions.

Method: Created a synthetic dataset with clinically consistent scenarios annotated with ground-truth diagnoses, featuring varying levels of linguistic noise and communication clarity. Fine-tuned and evaluated BERT-based and T5 models.

Result: Developed the NDB benchmark to stress-test LLM diagnostic capabilities under realistic linguistic conditions. The dataset is publicly available for reproducibility and future research.

Conclusion: The NDB benchmark addresses the critical need for evaluating LLMs on realistic patient narratives, providing a tool to assess and improve diagnostic capabilities in noisy, real-world healthcare communication scenarios.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare raises
critical questions about their ability to interpret patient-generated
narratives, which are often informal, ambiguous, and noisy. Existing benchmarks
typically rely on clean, structured clinical text, offering limited insight
into model performance under realistic conditions. In this work, we present a
novel synthetic dataset designed to simulate patient self-descriptions
characterized by varying levels of linguistic noise, fuzzy language, and
layperson terminology. Our dataset comprises clinically consistent scenarios
annotated with ground-truth diagnoses, spanning a spectrum of communication
clarity to reflect diverse real-world reporting styles. Using this benchmark,
we fine-tune and evaluate several state-of-the-art models (LLMs), including
BERT-based and encoder-decoder T5 models. To support reproducibility and future
research, we release the Noisy Diagnostic Benchmark (NDB), a structured dataset
of noisy, synthetic patient descriptions designed to stress-test and compare
the diagnostic capabilities of large language models (LLMs) under realistic
linguistic conditions. We made the benchmark available for the community:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PledgeTracker is a system that reformulates political pledge verification as structured event timeline construction rather than document classification, using multi-step evidence retrieval, timeline building, and fulfillment filtering to track evolving pledge fulfillment across multiple dynamic sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods oversimplify pledge verification as document classification, ignoring the dynamic, temporal, and multi-document nature of tracking political promises across continuously updated sources.

Method: Three-component system: (1) multi-step evidence retrieval module, (2) timeline construction module, and (3) fulfillment filtering module that captures evolving pledge fulfillment and produces structured, interpretable timelines.

Result: Evaluated with professional fact-checkers in real-world workflows, demonstrating effectiveness in retrieving relevant evidence and reducing human verification effort.

Conclusion: PledgeTracker successfully addresses the dynamic nature of pledge verification by transforming it into structured event timeline construction, providing practical utility for fact-checking workflows.

Abstract: Political pledges reflect candidates' policy commitments, but tracking their
fulfilment requires reasoning over incremental evidence distributed across
multiple, dynamically updated sources. Existing methods simplify this task into
a document classification task, overlooking its dynamic, temporal and
multi-document nature. To address this issue, we introduce
\textsc{PledgeTracker}, a system that reformulates pledge verification into
structured event timeline construction. PledgeTracker consists of three core
components: (1) a multi-step evidence retrieval module; (2) a timeline
construction module and; (3) a fulfilment filtering module, allowing the
capture of the evolving nature of pledge fulfilment and producing interpretable
and structured timelines. We evaluate PledgeTracker in collaboration with
professional fact-checkers in real-world workflows, demonstrating its
effectiveness in retrieving relevant evidence and reducing human verification
effort.

*Taichi Aida,Danushka Bollegala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCDTour is a method that orders and merges interpretable axes to balance performance and interpretability in semantic change detection, achieving comparable results to full-dimensional embeddings while maintaining high interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off problem in semantic change detection where improving interpretability often degrades performance, and vice versa, by developing a method that preserves both aspects.

Method: SCDTour orders and merges interpretable axes based on (a) semantic similarity between axes in the embedding space and (b) the degree to which each axis contributes to semantic change, producing a refined set of word senses.

Result: Experimental results show SCDTour preserves semantic change detection performance while maintaining high interpretability, with agglomerated sorted axes achieving comparable or improved performance against original full-dimensional embeddings.

Conclusion: SCDTour effectively balances interpretability and performance in semantic change detection, enabling meaningful interpretation of semantic shifts through a small number of refined axes.

Abstract: In Semantic Change Detection (SCD), it is a common problem to obtain
embeddings that are both interpretable and high-performing. However, improving
interpretability often leads to a loss in the SCD performance, and vice versa.
To address this problem, we propose SCDTour, a method that orders and merges
interpretable axes to alleviate the performance degradation of SCD. SCDTour
considers both (a) semantic similarity between axes in the embedding space, as
well as (b) the degree to which each axis contributes to semantic change.
Experimental results show that SCDTour preserves performance in semantic change
detection while maintaining high interpretability. Moreover, agglomerating the
sorted axes produces a more refined set of word senses, which achieves
comparable or improved performance against the original full-dimensional
embeddings in the SCD task. These findings demonstrate that SCDTour effectively
balances interpretability and SCD performance, enabling meaningful
interpretation of semantic shifts through a small number of refined axes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOOM is a dual-branch memory plugin for ultra-long dialogues that models plot development and character portrayal with a forgetting mechanism to control memory growth, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory extraction methods for human-robot role-playing dialogues suffer from uncontrolled memory growth, which hinders coherent ultra-long conversations.

Method: Propose MOOM with dual branches: one summarizes plot conflicts across multiple time scales, the other extracts user's character profile. Integrates a forgetting mechanism based on competition-inhibition theory to constrain memory capacity.

Result: MOOM outperforms all state-of-the-art memory extraction methods, requires fewer LLM invocations, and maintains controllable memory capacity. Also presents ZH-4O dataset with 600-turn average dialogues and manual memory annotations.

Conclusion: MOOM effectively addresses uncontrolled memory growth in ultra-long role-playing dialogues by leveraging literary theory and cognitive memory principles, demonstrating superior performance with efficient resource usage.

Abstract: Memory extraction is crucial for maintaining coherent ultra-long dialogues in
human-robot role-playing scenarios. However, existing methods often exhibit
uncontrolled memory growth. To address this, we propose MOOM, the first
dual-branch memory plugin that leverages literary theory by modeling plot
development and character portrayal as core storytelling elements.
Specifically, one branch summarizes plot conflicts across multiple time scales,
while the other extracts the user's character profile. MOOM further integrates
a forgetting mechanism, inspired by the ``competition-inhibition'' memory
theory, to constrain memory capacity and mitigate uncontrolled growth.
Furthermore, we present ZH-4O, a Chinese ultra-long dialogue dataset
specifically designed for role-playing, featuring dialogues that average 600
turns and include manually annotated memory information. Experimental results
demonstrate that MOOM outperforms all state-of-the-art memory extraction
methods, requiring fewer large language model invocations while maintaining a
controllable memory capacity.

TL;DR: PerspAct system integrates ReAct paradigm with LLMs to simulate developmental perspective taking stages. GPT produces developmentally-consistent narratives but shifts to advanced stages during interaction, with higher stages improving collaborative effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few computational models address both language and embodied perspective taking simultaneously, which are essential for human collaboration. This work aims to bridge this gap by integrating these capabilities in LLMs.

Method: Uses PerspAct system combining ReAct paradigm with LLMs, evaluated through extended director task. Assesses GPT's ability to generate developmentally-aligned narratives and their impact on collaborative performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Result: GPT reliably produces developmentally-consistent narratives before tasks but often shifts to more advanced stages during interaction. Higher developmental stages enhance collaborative effectiveness, while earlier stages yield more variable outcomes in complex contexts.

Conclusion: Language exchanges help refine internal representations in LLMs. Integrating embodied perspective taking and language shows potential for modeling developmental dynamics, emphasizing the importance of evaluating internal speech during combined linguistic and embodied tasks.

Abstract: Language and embodied perspective taking are essential for human
collaboration, yet few computational models address both simultaneously. This
work investigates the PerspAct system [1], which integrates the ReAct (Reason
and Act) paradigm with Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate developmental
stages of perspective taking, grounded in Selman's theory [2]. Using an
extended director task, we evaluate GPT's ability to generate internal
narratives aligned with specified developmental stages, and assess how these
influence collaborative performance both qualitatively (action selection) and
quantitatively (task efficiency). Results show that GPT reliably produces
developmentally-consistent narratives before task execution but often shifts
towards more advanced stages during interaction, suggesting that language
exchanges help refine internal representations. Higher developmental stages
generally enhance collaborative effectiveness, while earlier stages yield more
variable outcomes in complex contexts. These findings highlight the potential
of integrating embodied perspective taking and language in LLMs to better model
developmental dynamics and stress the importance of evaluating internal speech
during combined linguistic and embodied tasks.

### [217] [Uncertainty in Authorship: Why Perfect AI Detection Is Mathematically Impossible](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11915)
*Aadil Gani Ganie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper draws a quantum uncertainty parallel to AI-text detection, arguing that perfect detection is theoretically impossible when AI closely mimics human writing due to inherent trade-offs between detection accuracy and text authenticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs advance and AI-generated text becomes indistinguishable from human writing, there's a growing need to understand the fundamental limits of authorship detection methods and the inherent tensions involved.

Method: The paper uses conceptual analysis drawing parallels to quantum uncertainty principles, examining current detection methods (stylometry, watermarking, neural classifiers) and their inherent limitations through theoretical framework development.

Result: The analysis reveals that enhancing detection accuracy often disrupts text authenticity, creating a fundamental trade-off where perfect detection becomes theoretically impossible when AI text closely mimics human writing.

Conclusion: The AI-text detection challenge reflects a deeper, unavoidable tension in language nature itself, not just a technological problem requiring better tools, with significant implications for authorship, ethics, and policy.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more advanced, it is increasingly
difficult to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text. This
paper draws a conceptual parallel between quantum uncertainty and the limits of
authorship detection in natural language. We argue that there is a fundamental
trade-off: the more confidently one tries to identify whether a text was
written by a human or an AI, the more one risks disrupting the text's natural
flow and authenticity. This mirrors the tension between precision and
disturbance found in quantum systems. We explore how current detection
methods--such as stylometry, watermarking, and neural classifiers--face
inherent limitations. Enhancing detection accuracy often leads to changes in
the AI's output, making other features less reliable. In effect, the very act
of trying to detect AI authorship introduces uncertainty elsewhere in the text.
Our analysis shows that when AI-generated text closely mimics human writing,
perfect detection becomes not just technologically difficult but theoretically
impossible. We address counterarguments and discuss the broader implications
for authorship, ethics, and policy. Ultimately, we suggest that the challenge
of AI-text detection is not just a matter of better tools--it reflects a
deeper, unavoidable tension in the nature of language itself.

*Helene Tenzer,Oumnia Abidi,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs generate accurate literal translations but struggle with cultural appropriateness. Culturally-tailored prompting improves cultural fit in English-Japanese workplace email translations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs produce near-perfect literal translations, their ability to support culturally appropriate communication across different cultural contexts remains unclear, particularly in multilingual workplace interactions.

Method: Mixed-methods study analyzing English-Japanese workplace email translations using three prompting strategies: naive translation prompts, audience-targeted prompts specifying cultural background, and instructional prompts with explicit guidance on Japanese communication norms. Evaluated culture-specific language patterns and native speaker perceptions of tone appropriateness.

Result: Culturally-tailored prompting (audience-targeted and instructional prompts) can improve cultural fit compared to naive translation approaches.

Conclusion: Recommendations are provided for designing culturally inclusive LLMs in multilingual settings, emphasizing the importance of culturally-aware prompting strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in everyday communication,
including multilingual interactions across different cultural contexts. While
LLMs can now generate near-perfect literal translations, it remains unclear
whether LLMs support culturally appropriate communication. In this paper, we
analyze the cultural sensitivity of different LLM designs when applied to
English-Japanese translations of workplace e-mails. Here, we vary the prompting
strategies: (1) naive "just translate" prompts, (2) audience-targeted prompts
specifying the recipient's cultural background, and (3) instructional prompts
with explicit guidance on Japanese communication norms. Using a mixed-methods
study, we then analyze culture-specific language patterns to evaluate how well
translations adapt to cultural norms. Further, we examine the appropriateness
of the tone of the translations as perceived by native speakers. We find that
culturally-tailored prompting can improve cultural fit, based on which we offer
recommendations for designing culturally inclusive LLMs in multilingual
settings.

TL;DR: Spec-LLaVA accelerates Vision-Language Models using speculative decoding with a lightweight draft model and dynamic tree-based verification, achieving 3.28× faster decoding without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models suffer from slow autoregressive inference, limiting deployment in real-time applications that require fast multimodal reasoning.

Method: Pairs a lightweight draft VLM with a large target model, using dynamic tree-based verification that adaptively expands and prunes speculative branches based on draft model confidence.

Result: Achieves up to 3.28× faster decoding on LLaVA-1.5 (7B, 13B) on MS COCO out-of-domain images with no loss in generation quality.

Conclusion: Presents a lossless acceleration framework for VLMs using dynamic tree-structured speculative decoding, enabling practical real-time multimodal assistants and resource-constrained deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable powerful multimodal reasoning but suffer
from slow autoregressive inference, limiting their deployment in real-time
applications. We introduce Spec-LLaVA, a system that applies speculative
decoding to accelerate VLMs without sacrificing output quality. Spec-LLaVA
pairs a lightweight draft VLM with a large target model: the draft speculates
future tokens, which the target verifies in parallel, allowing multiple tokens
to be generated per step. To maximize efficiency, we design a dynamic
tree-based verification algorithm that adaptively expands and prunes
speculative branches using draft model confidence. On MS COCO out-of-domain
images, Spec-LLaVA achieves up to 3.28$\times$ faster decoding on LLaVA-1.5
(7B, 13B) with no loss in generation quality. This work presents a lossless
acceleration framework for VLMs using dynamic tree-structured speculative
decoding, opening a path toward practical real-time multimodal assistants.
Importantly, the lightweight draft model design makes the framework amenable to
resource-constrained or on-device deployment settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models trained on natural language outputs fail to properly evaluate tool-based reasoning and execution, creating a critical gap as LLMs increasingly interact with external tools.

Method: Developed FC-RewardBench benchmark for systematic assessment, then proposed training framework for outcome-based reward models using data synthesized from permissively licensed open-weight LLMs (1.7B to 14B parameters).

Result: Trained models consistently outperform general-purpose baselines across seven out-of-domain benchmarks, achieving up to 25% average improvement in downstream task performance and enabling data-efficient fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Domain-specific reward modeling for tool use is essential, and the proposed outcome-based approach using open-weight LLMs effectively addresses the limitations of current general-purpose reward models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly interact with external tools,
reward modeling for tool use has become a critical yet underexplored area.
Existing reward models, trained primarily on natural language outputs, struggle
to evaluate tool-based reasoning and execution. To quantify this gap, we
introduce FC-RewardBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically assess
reward models' performance in tool-calling scenarios. Our analysis shows that
current reward models often miss key signals of effective tool use,
highlighting the need for domain-specific modeling. To address this, we propose
a training framework for outcome-based reward models using data synthesized
from permissively licensed, open-weight LLMs. We train models ranging from 1.7B
to 14B parameters and evaluate them across seven out-of-domain benchmarks.
These models consistently outperform general-purpose baselines, achieving up to
25\% average improvement in downstream task performance and enabling
data-efficient fine-tuning through reward-guided filtering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve productivity in analyzing client feedback by determining sentiment causes from large text documents, addressing the linguistic dissonance between queries and source documents in query-focused summarization.

Method: Proposed a multi-bias framework to bridge the gap between queries and documents at a domain-agnostic level, with specialized approaches using sentiment-based biases and query expansion for sentiment explanation tasks.

Result: Achieved experimental results that outperform baseline models on a real-world proprietary sentiment-aware query-focused summarization dataset.

Conclusion: The multi-bias framework effectively addresses linguistic dissonance in query-focused summarization, particularly for sentiment analysis tasks, demonstrating improved performance over baseline approaches.

Abstract: Constructive analysis of feedback from clients often requires determining the
cause of their sentiment from a substantial amount of text documents. To assist
and improve the productivity of such endeavors, we leverage the task of
Query-Focused Summarization (QFS). Models of this task are often impeded by the
linguistic dissonance between the query and the source documents. We propose
and substantiate a multi-bias framework to help bridge this gap at a
domain-agnostic, generic level; we then formulate specialized approaches for
the problem of sentiment explanation through sentiment-based biases and query
expansion. We achieve experimental results outperforming baseline models on a
real-world proprietary sentiment-aware QFS dataset.

Abstract: We describe Vicomtech's participation in the CLEARS challenge on text
adaptation to Plain Language and Easy Read in Spanish. Our approach features
automatic post-editing of different types of initial Large Language Model

*Alina Klerings,Jannik Brinkmann,Daniel Ruffinelli,Simone Ponzetto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how LLMs internally encode syntactic knowledge of verb tense and aspect, identifies orthogonal control directions for these grammatical features, and demonstrates causal control through concept steering while studying optimal steering parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language models internally represent complex syntactic knowledge like verb tense and aspect, moving beyond binary grammatical contrasts to study multidimensional hierarchical grammar phenomena.

Method: Used linear discriminant analysis to identify distinct, orthogonal directions in residual space for verb tense and aspect. Conducted concept steering experiments across three generation tasks to demonstrate causal control over grammatical features, and studied steering parameters (strength, location, duration) in multi-token generation.

Result: Successfully identified separate control directions for tense and aspect, demonstrated effective causal control over both grammatical features, and found that steering strength, location, and duration are crucial parameters that influence generation quality and minimize side effects like topic shift and degeneration.

Conclusion: LLMs encode tense and aspect in structurally organized, human-like ways, but effective control during generation requires careful tuning of steering parameters, suggesting the need for manual optimization or automated parameter search.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are able to generate grammatically well-formed
text, but how do they encode their syntactic knowledge internally? While prior
work has focused largely on binary grammatical contrasts, in this work, we
study the representation and control of two multidimensional hierarchical
grammar phenomena - verb tense and aspect - and for each, identify distinct,
orthogonal directions in residual space using linear discriminant analysis.
Next, we demonstrate causal control over both grammatical features through
concept steering across three generation tasks. Then, we use these identified
features in a case study to investigate factors influencing effective steering
in multi-token generation. We find that steering strength, location, and
duration are crucial parameters for reducing undesirable side effects such as
topic shift and degeneration. Our findings suggest that models encode tense and
aspect in structurally organized, human-like ways, but effective control of
such features during generation is sensitive to multiple factors and requires
manual tuning or automated optimization.

TL;DR: SENSE is an open-source multilingual speech-text embedding model that improves upon SAMU-XLSR with better teacher models and speech encoders, achieving competitive performance on semantic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an improved multilingual speech-text alignment system that bridges speech and text representations across multiple languages using a teacher-student framework.

Method: Uses teacher-student framework to align self-supervised speech encoder with language-agnostic text encoder representations. Updates SAMU-XLSR with stronger teacher text model and better initial speech encoder.

Result: Achieves highly competitive performance on multilingual and multimodal semantic tasks. First model publicly released and integrated into SpeechBrain toolkit.

Conclusion: Provides new insights into how semantics are captured in semantically aligned speech encoders and offers an open-source solution for multilingual speech-text representation learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces SENSE (Shared Embedding for N-lingual Speech and tExt),
an open-source solution inspired by the SAMU-XLSR framework and conceptually
similar to Meta AI's SONAR models. These approaches rely on a teacher-student
framework to align a self-supervised speech encoder with the language-agnostic
continuous representations of a text encoder at the utterance level. We
describe how the original SAMU-XLSR method has been updated by selecting a
stronger teacher text model and a better initial speech encoder. The source
code for training and using SENSE models has been integrated into the
SpeechBrain toolkit, and the first SENSE model we trained has been publicly
released. We report experimental results on multilingual and multimodal
semantic tasks, where our SENSE model achieves highly competitive performance.
Finally, this study offers new insights into how semantics are captured in such
semantically aligned speech encoders.

### [225] [Is 'Hope' a person or an idea? A pilot benchmark for NER: comparing traditional NLP tools and large language models on ambiguous entities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12098)
*Payam Latifi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs outperform traditional NLP tools in NER tasks, especially for context-sensitive entities like person names, with Gemini achieving the highest F1-score. However, traditional tools like Stanza show better consistency for structured entities like locations and dates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare the performance of traditional NLP tools (NLTK, spaCy, Stanza) versus large language models (Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen) in Named Entity Recognition tasks across different entity types.

Method: Created a manually annotated benchmark dataset of 119 tokens covering 5 entity types (PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, DATE, TIME). Evaluated six systems using F1-score against the gold standard annotations.

Result: LLMs generally outperformed traditional tools, particularly for context-sensitive entities. Gemini achieved the highest average F1-score. Traditional systems like Stanza performed better on structured tags (LOCATION, DATE). Variability was observed among LLMs in handling temporal expressions and multi-word organizations.

Conclusion: While LLMs offer improved contextual understanding in NER, traditional tools remain competitive for specific structured tasks, providing guidance for model selection based on entity type requirements.

Abstract: This pilot study presents a small-scale but carefully annotated benchmark of
Named Entity Recognition (NER) performance across six systems: three non-LLM
NLP tools (NLTK, spaCy, Stanza) and three general-purpose large language models
(LLMs: Gemini-1.5-flash, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-3-4B). The dataset contains 119
tokens covering five entity types (PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, DATE, TIME).
We evaluated each system's output against the manually annotated gold standard
dataset using F1-score. The results show that LLMs generally outperform
conventional tools in recognizing context-sensitive entities like person names,
with Gemini achieving the highest average F1-score. However, traditional
systems like Stanza demonstrate greater consistency in structured tags such as
LOCATION and DATE. We also observed variability among LLMs, particularly in
handling temporal expressions and multi-word organizations. Our findings
highlight that while LLMs offer improved contextual understanding, traditional
tools remain competitive in specific tasks, informing model selection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Domain-specific self-supervised pre-training on ATC data significantly improves ASR performance over general speech models, with streaming approaches enabling low-latency real-time processing for aviation applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy and efficiency in Air Traffic Control environments by leveraging domain-specific self-supervised learning rather than relying on general-purpose speech models.

Method: Train BEST-RQ models on 4.5k hours of unlabeled ATC data, then fine-tune on supervised ATC data. Implement chunked attention and dynamic convolutions for real-time streaming ASR with low latency.

Result: Domain-adapted pre-training substantially reduces word error rates on ATC benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art general speech encoders (w2v-BERT 2.0, HuBERT). Streaming approach further improves performance under latency constraints.

Conclusion: Specializing SSL representations for ATC data is an effective approach for developing more accurate and efficient ASR systems suitable for safety-critical aviation applications.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the benefits of domain-specific self-supervised
pre-training for both offline and streaming ASR in Air Traffic Control (ATC)
environments. We train BEST-RQ models on 4.5k hours of unlabeled ATC data, then
fine-tune on a smaller supervised ATC set. To enable real-time processing, we
propose using chunked attention and dynamic convolutions, ensuring low-latency
inference. We compare these in-domain SSL models against state-of-the-art,
general-purpose speech encoders such as w2v-BERT 2.0 and HuBERT. Results show
that domain-adapted pre-training substantially improves performance on standard
ATC benchmarks, significantly reducing word error rates when compared to models
trained on broad speech corpora. Furthermore, the proposed streaming approach
further improves word error rate under tighter latency constraints, making it
particularly suitable for safety-critical aviation applications. These findings
highlight that specializing SSL representations for ATC data is a practical
path toward more accurate and efficient ASR systems in real-world operational
settings.

*Min Zeng,Jinfei Sun,Xueyou Luo,Caiquan Liu,Shiqi Zhang,Li Xie,Xiaoxin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GTA framework combines supervised fine-tuning efficiency with reinforcement learning capability gains through a guess-think-answer process with RL rewards, achieving faster convergence and higher performance than pure SFT or RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pure RL fine-tuning suffers from inefficient exploration and slow convergence, while SFT methods have limited performance ceiling and weaker theoretical foundation. There's a need to address the efficiency-capability trade-off between these approaches.

Method: Proposes Guess-Think-Answer (GTA) framework: model produces provisional guess (optimized via cross-entropy loss), reflects on the guess, then generates final answer with RL rewards shaping both output and structure format. Uses loss masking and gradient constraints to mitigate training signal conflicts.

Result: Empirical results on four text classification benchmarks show GTA substantially accelerates convergence while outperforming both standalone SFT and RL baselines.

Conclusion: GTA successfully combines the efficiency of supervised fine-tuning with the capability gains of reinforcement learning in a unified training paradigm, achieving both faster convergence than pure RL and higher performance ceiling than pure SFT.

Abstract: In natural language processing tasks, pure reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning methods often suffer from inefficient exploration and slow
convergence; while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) methods, although efficient in
training, have limited performance ceiling and less solid theoretical
foundation compared to RL. To address efficiency-capability trade-off, we
propose the Guess-Think-Answer (GTA) framework that combines the efficiency of
SFT with the capability gains of RL in a unified training paradigm. GTA works
by having the model first produce a provisional guess (optimized via
cross-entropy loss), then reflect on this guess before generating the final
answer, with RL rewards shaping both the final output and the format of the
entire GTA structure. This hybrid approach achieves both faster convergence
than pure RL and higher performance ceiling than pure SFT. To mitigate gradient
conflicts between the two training signals, we employ loss masking and gradient
constraints. Empirical results on four text classification benchmarks
demonstrate that GTA substantially accelerates convergence while outperforming
both standalone SFT and RL baselines.

*Jiaxuan Zhao,Naibin Gu,Yuchen Feng,Xiyu Liu,Peng Fu,Zheng Lin,Weiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CBP-Tuning is a privacy-preserving framework that enables efficient local customization of black-box LLMs through server-side prompt generation and client-side gradient-free optimization, eliminating the need for model weight access or data upload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the dual challenge of high customization costs for LLMs and privacy risks when using cloud-based services, enabling personalized adaptation without exposing sensitive data.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) Server-side prompt generator trained for domain-specific, task-agnostic capabilities; (2) User-side gradient-free optimization that tailors soft prompts for individual tasks using only a single customized vector per task.

Result: Superior performance demonstrated in commonsense reasoning, medical, and financial domains compared to baselines, showing advantages in task-agnostic processing and privacy preservation.

Conclusion: CBP-Tuning provides an effective solution for bidirectional privacy preservation while enabling efficient local customization of black-box LLMs, requiring minimal client resources and no sensitive data exposure.

Abstract: The high costs of customizing large language models (LLMs) fundamentally
limit their adaptability to user-specific needs. Consequently, LLMs are
increasingly offered as cloud-based services, a paradigm that introduces
critical limitations: providers struggle to support personalized customization
at scale, while users face privacy risks when exposing sensitive data. To
address this dual challenge, we propose Customized Black-box Prompt Tuning
(CBP-Tuning), a novel framework that facilitates efficient local customization
while preserving bidirectional privacy. Specifically, we design a two-stage
framework: (1) a prompt generator trained on the server-side to capture
domain-specific and task-agnostic capabilities, and (2) user-side gradient-free
optimization that tailors soft prompts for individual tasks. This approach
eliminates the need for users to access model weights or upload private data,
requiring only a single customized vector per task while achieving effective
adaptation. Furthermore, the evaluation of CBP-Tuning in the commonsense
reasoning, medical and financial domain settings demonstrates superior
performance compared to baselines, showcasing its advantages in task-agnostic
processing and privacy preservation.

*Ariana Sahitaj,Jiaao Li,Pia Wenzel Neves,Fedor Splitt,Premtim Sahitaj,Charlott Jakob,Veronika Solopova,Vera Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XplaiNLP's submission to CheckThat! 2025 used supervised fine-tuning of transformer models and zero-shot LLM prompting for multilingual subjectivity detection, achieving top results in Italian and competitive performance in Romanian, Greek, and German.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop effective methods for multilingual subjectivity detection across different languages, addressing the challenge of generalization in low-resource cross-lingual scenarios.

Method: Two approaches: (1) Supervised fine-tuning of transformer encoders (EuroBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, German-BERT) on monolingual and machine-translated data; (2) Zero-shot prompting using LLMs (o3-mini for rule-based labeling and gpt-4.1-mini for contrastive rewriting and comparative reasoning).

Result: Achieved 1st place in Italian monolingual subtask (F1=0.8104 vs baseline 0.6941), 3rd in Romanian zero-shot (F1=0.7917 vs baseline 0.6461), reliable multilingual performance, and baseline improvements in Greek. Performance fell below baselines in Ukrainian and Polish zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: Transformer fine-tuning and LLM prompting are effective for multilingual subjectivity detection, though generalization remains challenging in low-resource cross-lingual scenarios, particularly for languages like Ukrainian and Polish.

Abstract: This notebook reports the XplaiNLP submission to the CheckThat! 2025 shared
task on multilingual subjectivity detection. We evaluate two approaches: (1)
supervised fine-tuning of transformer encoders, EuroBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and
German-BERT, on monolingual and machine-translated training data; and (2)
zero-shot prompting using two LLMs: o3-mini for Annotation (rule-based
labelling) and gpt-4.1-mini for DoubleDown (contrastive rewriting) and
Perspective (comparative reasoning). The Annotation Approach achieves 1st place
in the Italian monolingual subtask with an F_1 score of 0.8104, outperforming
the baseline of 0.6941. In the Romanian zero-shot setting, the fine-tuned
XLM-RoBERTa model obtains an F_1 score of 0.7917, ranking 3rd and exceeding the
baseline of 0.6461. The same model also performs reliably in the multilingual
task and improves over the baseline in Greek. For German, a German-BERT model
fine-tuned on translated training data from typologically related languages
yields competitive performance over the baseline. In contrast, performance in
the Ukrainian and Polish zero-shot settings falls slightly below the respective
baselines, reflecting the challenge of generalization in low-resource
cross-lingual scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show shallow understanding of puns despite detection capabilities, being easily misled by subtle changes in wordplay that humans grasp naturally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the depth of LLM understanding of puns and humor, revealing limitations in nuanced interpretation compared to human comprehension.

Method: Systematic analysis and reformulation of existing pun benchmarks, creating comprehensive detection benchmarks with human evaluation across recent LLMs.

Result: Subtle changes in puns are sufficient to mislead LLMs, demonstrating their shallow understanding and lack of nuanced grasp typical of human interpretation.

Conclusion: LLMs face significant robustness challenges in processing puns and require more sophisticated understanding mechanisms to match human-level humor comprehension.

Abstract: Puns are a form of humorous wordplay that exploits polysemy and phonetic
similarity. While LLMs have shown promise in detecting puns, we show in this
paper that their understanding often remains shallow, lacking the nuanced grasp
typical of human interpretation. By systematically analyzing and reformulating
existing pun benchmarks, we demonstrate how subtle changes in puns are
sufficient to mislead LLMs. Our contributions include comprehensive and nuanced
pun detection benchmarks, human evaluation across recent LLMs, and an analysis
of the robustness challenges these models face in processing puns.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAGs-to-Riches is a new prompting framework that reformulates LLM role-playing as a text retrieval problem, using curated reference demonstrations to improve model authenticity and prevent character breaks during hostile interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs deployed in high-stakes domains like healthcare and education often break character in harmful ways during few-shot role-playing, especially when interacting with hostile users, which impacts user trust and well-being.

Method: Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation, the framework reformulates role-playing as a text retrieval problem and uses curated reference demonstrations to condition LLM responses. It introduces novel token-level ROUGE metrics (IOO and IOR) for evaluation.

Result: The method incorporates 35% more tokens from reference demonstrations during hostile interactions. Across 453 role-playing interactions, models were consistently judged as more authentic and remained in-character more often than zero-shot and ICL methods.

Conclusion: RAGs-to-Riches provides a scalable strategy for building robust, human-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks that maintain character authenticity even in challenging interaction scenarios.

Abstract: Role-playing Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in
high-stakes domains such as healthcare, education, and governance, where
failures can directly impact user trust and well-being. A cost effective
paradigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches
often cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful
ways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a
text retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called
RAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition
LLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting
and introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output
(IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References
(IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation
tasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy
incorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens
from the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing
interactions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and
remain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL)
methods. Our method presents a scalable strategy for building robust,
human-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether speech-aware large language models preserve their language understanding capabilities when accessed through speech input rather than text, and to measure fairness across different speaker categories.

Method: Uses textual tasks combined with a voice cloning text-to-speech model to create speech inputs, then quantifies performance preservation across modalities and fairness for different speaker categories.

Result: The paper presents the C3T benchmark methodology but does not report specific experimental results in this abstract.

Conclusion: C3T provides a standardized way to evaluate speech-aware LLMs' cross-modal capability conservation, fairness across speakers, and robustness between text and speech modalities.

Abstract: The paper presents C3T (Cross-modal Capabilities Conservation Test), a new
benchmark for assessing the performance of speech-aware large language models.
The benchmark utilizes textual tasks and a voice cloning text-to-speech model
to quantify the extent to which language understanding capabilities are
preserved when the model is accessed via speech input. C3T quantifies the
fairness of the model for different categories of speakers and its robustness
across text and speech modalities.

*Nam H. Le,Patrick Erickson,Yanbo Zhang,Michael Levin,Josh Bongard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that simple agents' collective behavior can be guided by free-form natural language prompts without task-specific tuning or engineered rewards, using an AI system that evolves to interpret and respond to language instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between human language expressiveness and artificial/biological systems' ability to interpret it, enabling natural language control over complex decentralized systems without engineered rewards or domain-specific programming.

Method: A two-model AI system: one model transforms natural language prompts into interventions for simulated cells, another scores how well prompts describe resulting dynamics, and the first model is evolved to improve scores from the second model.

Result: The evolved system successfully guides collective behavior using free-form language prompts and generalizes to unseen prompts without retraining, demonstrating language-based control without engineered fitness functions.

Conclusion: This work represents a concrete step toward AI-biology partnerships where natural language replaces mathematical objective functions and domain-specific programming, suggesting a future where spoken/written prompts can direct computational, robotic, or biological systems.

Abstract: Human language is one of the most expressive tools for conveying intent, yet
most artificial or biological systems lack mechanisms to interpret or respond
meaningfully to it. Bridging this gap could enable more natural forms of
control over complex, decentralized systems. In AI and artificial life, recent
work explores how language can specify high-level goals, but most systems still
depend on engineered rewards, task-specific supervision, or rigid command sets,
limiting generalization to novel instructions. Similar constraints apply in
synthetic biology and bioengineering, where the locus of control is often
genomic rather than environmental perturbation.
  A key open question is whether artificial or biological collectives can be
guided by free-form natural language alone, without task-specific tuning or
carefully designed evaluation metrics. We provide one possible answer here by
showing, for the first time, that simple agents' collective behavior can be
guided by free-form language prompts: one AI model transforms an imperative
prompt into an intervention that is applied to simulated cells; a second AI
model scores how well the prompt describes the resulting cellular dynamics; and
the former AI model is evolved to improve the scores generated by the latter.
  Unlike previous work, our method does not require engineered fitness
functions or domain-specific prompt design. We show that the evolved system
generalizes to unseen prompts without retraining. By treating natural language
as a control layer, the system suggests a future in which spoken or written
prompts could direct computational, robotic, or biological systems to desired
behaviors. This work provides a concrete step toward this vision of AI-biology
partnerships, in which language replaces mathematical objective functions,
fixed rules, and domain-specific programming.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Maestro is a self-evolving image generation system that enables text-to-image models to autonomously improve generated images through iterative prompt evolution using only an initial prompt, without requiring human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models currently require significant human intervention and iterative prompt engineering, posing usability challenges that limit their practical application.

Method: Uses two key innovations: 1) self-critique with specialized MLLM agents acting as critics to identify weaknesses and provide edit signals, and 2) self-evolution using MLLM-as-a-judge for head-to-head comparisons between iteratively generated images to evolve better prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments show Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial prompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with more advanced MLLM components.

Conclusion: Maestro presents a robust, interpretable, and effective pathway towards self-improving text-to-image generation that reduces reliance on human intervention.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models, while offering immense creative potential, are
highly reliant on human intervention, posing significant usability challenges
that often necessitate manual, iterative prompt engineering over often
underspecified prompts. This paper introduces Maestro, a novel self-evolving
image generation system that enables T2I models to autonomously self-improve
generated images through iterative evolution of prompts, using only an initial
prompt. Maestro incorporates two key innovations: 1) self-critique, where
specialized multimodal LLM (MLLM) agents act as 'critics' to identify
weaknesses in generated images, correct for under-specification, and provide
interpretable edit signals, which are then integrated by a 'verifier' agent
while preserving user intent; and 2) self-evolution, utilizing MLLM-as-a-judge
for head-to-head comparisons between iteratively generated images, eschewing
problematic images, and evolving creative prompt candidates that align with
user intents. Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks using black-box models
demonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial
prompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with
more advanced MLLM components. This work presents a robust, interpretable, and
effective pathway towards self-improving T2I generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI models exhibit distinct evaluation personalities - GPT-4o-mini is consistent, GPT-4o detects errors well, GPT-5 is conservative with high variability. GPT models show 2:1 negative bias and cluster together, while Gemini has different strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding AI assessment behavior is crucial as AI systems increasingly evaluate other AI outputs, to prevent cascading biases in automated evaluation systems.

Method: Analyzed vision-language descriptions from NVIDIA's Describe Anything Model evaluated by three GPT variants. Used Gemini 2.5 Pro as independent question generator for controlled experiments. Conducted cross-family analysis through semantic similarity of generated questions.

Result: GPT-4o-mini shows systematic consistency, GPT-4o excels at error detection, GPT-5 exhibits extreme conservatism with high variability. GPT models demonstrate consistent 2:1 bias favoring negative assessment and cluster together, while Gemini shows markedly different evaluation strategies.

Conclusion: Evaluation competence doesn't scale with general capability. Robust AI assessment requires diverse architectural perspectives to avoid systematic biases and ensure comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly evaluate other AI outputs, understanding their
assessment behavior becomes crucial for preventing cascading biases. This study
analyzes vision-language descriptions generated by NVIDIA's Describe Anything
Model and evaluated by three GPT variants (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-5) to
uncover distinct "evaluation personalities" the underlying assessment
strategies and biases each model demonstrates. GPT-4o-mini exhibits systematic
consistency with minimal variance, GPT-4o excels at error detection, while
GPT-5 shows extreme conservatism with high variability. Controlled experiments
using Gemini 2.5 Pro as an independent question generator validate that these
personalities are inherent model properties rather than artifacts. Cross-family
analysis through semantic similarity of generated questions reveals significant
divergence: GPT models cluster together with high similarity while Gemini
exhibits markedly different evaluation strategies. All GPT models demonstrate a
consistent 2:1 bias favoring negative assessment over positive confirmation,
though this pattern appears family-specific rather than universal across AI
architectures. These findings suggest that evaluation competence does not scale
with general capability and that robust AI assessment requires diverse
architectural perspectives.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GEO-16 framework audits web page quality for AI citation engines, finding that higher quality pages (GEO score ≥0.70 + 12+ pillar hits) get cited more frequently across Brave, Google, and Perplexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI answer engines increasingly mediate access to domain knowledge by generating responses and citing web sources, requiring a framework to evaluate the quality of cited pages.

Method: Introduced GEO-16 framework with 16 quality pillars, collected 1,702 citations across 3 AI engines using 70 product intent prompts, and audited 1,100 unique URLs with logistic models and domain clustered standard errors.

Result: Engines differed in citation quality; Metadata/Freshness, Semantic HTML, and Structured Data pillars showed strongest citation associations. Higher quality pages (G≥0.70 + 12+ pillar hits) had substantially higher citation rates.

Conclusion: Overall page quality strongly predicts citation, with practical thresholds identified for publishers. Study is observational and focused on English B2B SaaS pages with discussed limitations.

Abstract: AI answer engines increasingly mediate access to domain knowledge by
generating responses and citing web sources. We introduce GEO-16, a 16 pillar
auditing framework that converts on page quality signals into banded pillar
scores and a normalized GEO score G that ranges from 0 to 1. Using 70 product
intent prompts, we collected 1,702 citations across three engines (Brave
Summary, Google AI Overviews, and Perplexity) and audited 1,100 unique URLs. In
our corpus, the engines differed in the GEO quality of the pages they cited,
and pillars related to Metadata and Freshness, Semantic HTML, and Structured
Data showed the strongest associations with citation. Logistic models with
domain clustered standard errors indicate that overall page quality is a strong
predictor of citation, and simple operating points (for example, G at least
0.70 combined with at least 12 pillar hits) align with substantially higher
citation rates in our data. We report per engine contrasts, vertical effects,
threshold analysis, and diagnostics, then translate findings into a practical
playbook for publishers. The study is observational and focuses on English
language B2B SaaS pages; we discuss limitations, threats to validity, and
reproducibility considerations.

TL;DR: Comprehensive benchmark study of 18 agentic configurations across LLMs reveals significant model-specific architectural preferences and poor performance on enterprise tasks (max 35.3% success on complex tasks).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited empirical understanding of how different design dimensions interact within complex multi-agent systems, addressing gaps in agentic architecture research.

Method: Enterprise-specific benchmark evaluating 18 distinct agentic configurations across state-of-the-art LLMs, examining four dimensions: orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation, memory architecture, and thinking tool integration.

Result: Revealed significant model-specific architectural preferences challenging one-size-fits-all paradigm. Found significant weaknesses in agentic performance with highest scoring models achieving only 35.3% success on complex tasks and 70.8% on simpler tasks.

Conclusion: Findings should inform future agentic system design by enabling more empirically backed decisions regarding architectural components and model selection.

Abstract: While individual components of agentic architectures have been studied in
isolation, there remains limited empirical understanding of how different
design dimensions interact within complex multi-agent systems. This study aims
to address these gaps by providing a comprehensive enterprise-specific
benchmark evaluating 18 distinct agentic configurations across state-of-the-art
large language models. We examine four critical agentic system dimensions:
orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct versus function
calling), memory architecture, and thinking tool integration. Our benchmark
reveals significant model-specific architectural preferences that challenge the
prevalent one-size-fits-all paradigm in agentic AI systems. It also reveals
significant weaknesses in overall agentic performance on enterprise tasks with
the highest scoring models achieving a maximum of only 35.3\% success on the
more complex task and 70.8\% on the simpler task. We hope these findings inform
the design of future agentic systems by enabling more empirically backed
decisions regarding architectural components and model selection.

### [239] [LLM Enhancement with Domain Expert Mental Model to Reduce LLM Hallucination with Causal Prompt Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10818)
*Boris Kovalerchuk,Brent D. Fegley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel EMM algorithm for LLM prompt engineering to address decision-making challenges where LLMs lack critical information, using optimized human-machine dialogue and mathematical functions to create expert mental models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with decision-making due to missing training data and hallucinations. RAG helps but remains insufficient for complex tasks requiring expert mental models that aren't well-documented.

Method: Four-step EMM algorithm: factor identification, hierarchical structuring, generating generalized expert mental model specification, and creating detailed model from specification using monotone Boolean and k-valued functions.

Result: The approach enables computationally tractable personal expert mental models for decision-making, making LLMs more effective for complex decisions with missing information.

Conclusion: The proposed EMM algorithm provides a systematic framework for LLM prompt engineering that captures complex expert decision-making processes, addressing limitations of current LLM and RAG approaches for decision support.

Abstract: Difficult decision-making problems abound in various disciplines and domains.
The proliferation of generative techniques, especially large language models
(LLMs), has excited interest in using them for decision support. However, LLMs
cannot yet resolve missingness in their training data, leading to
hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by
incorporating external information retrieval, reducing hallucinations and
improving accuracy. Yet, RAG and related methods are only partial solutions, as
they may lack access to all necessary sources or key missing information. Even
everyday issues often challenge LLMs' abilities. Submitting longer prompts with
context and examples is one approach to address knowledge gaps, but designing
effective prompts is non-trivial and may not capture complex mental models of
domain experts. For tasks with missing critical information, LLMs are
insufficient, as are many existing systems poorly represented in available
documents. This paper explores how LLMs can make decision-making more
efficient, using a running example of evaluating whether to respond to a call
for proposals. We propose a technology based on optimized human-machine
dialogue and monotone Boolean and k-valued functions to discover a
computationally tractable personal expert mental model (EMM) of
decision-making. Our EMM algorithm for LLM prompt engineering has four steps:
(1) factor identification, (2) hierarchical structuring of factors, (3)
generating a generalized expert mental model specification, and (4) generating
a detailed generalized expert mental model from that specification.

*Yuyin Lu,Hegang Chen,Yanghui Rao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LVSA is a neuro-symbolic framework that combines differentiable Skolemization with neural negation to efficiently answer complex queries over incomplete knowledge graphs while maintaining logical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental trade-off between logical soundness and computational efficiency in Complex Query Answering over incomplete Knowledge Graphs, where existing methods either suffer from combinatorial explosion (Grounding-based) or compromise logical consistency (Skolemization-based).

Method: Proposes Logic-constrained Vector Symbolic Architecture (LVSA) with a differentiable Skolemization module, neural negator, and logical constraint-driven optimization protocol to harmonize geometric and logical requirements.

Result: Theoretically guarantees universality for all EFO$_1$ queries. Empirically outperforms state-of-the-art Skolemization-based methods and reduces inference costs by orders of magnitude compared to Grounding-based baselines.

Conclusion: LVSA successfully addresses the limitations of both Grounding and Skolemization approaches, providing an efficient and logically consistent solution for complex query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Complex Query Answering (CQA) over incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs),
typically formalized as reasoning with Existential First-Order predicate logic
with one free variable (EFO$_1$), faces a fundamental trade-off between logical
soundness and computational efficiency. This work establishes the
Grounding-Skolemization dichotomy for systematically analyzing CQA methods
through the lens of formal logic. While Grounding-based methods inherently
suffer from combinatorial explosion, most Skolemization-based methods neglect
to explicitly model Skolem functions and compromise logical consistency. To
address these limitations, we propose the Logic-constrained Vector Symbolic
Architecture (LVSA), a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies a differentiable
Skolemization module and a neural negator, as well as a logical
constraint-driven optimization protocol to harmonize geometric and logical
requirements. Theoretically, LVSA guarantees universality for all EFO$_1$
queries. Empirically, it outperforms state-of-the-art Skolemization-based
methods and reduces inference costs by orders of magnitude compared to
Grounding-based baselines.

### [241] [Is the `Agent' Paradigm a Limiting Framework for Next-Generation Intelligent Systems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10875)
*Jesse Gardner,Vladimir A. Baulin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critically re-evaluates the agent-centric paradigm in AI, arguing it has conceptual ambiguities and anthropocentric biases that limit progress. It proposes shifting focus to system-level dynamics and non-agentic frameworks for more robust general intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the dominant agent-centric paradigm in AI research, which the authors argue suffers from persistent conceptual ambiguities, inherent anthropocentric biases, and may represent a limiting framework that obscures underlying computational mechanisms.

Method: Systematic review of relevant literature to deconstruct the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks, distinguishing between agentic systems (AI inspired by agency), agential systems (fully autonomous biological systems), and non-agentic systems (tools without agency impression).

Result: The analysis reveals challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and goal-directedness, showing that the 'agentic' framing of many AI systems can be misleading and may obscure computational mechanisms, particularly in LLMs.

Conclusion: Investigating non-agentic and systemic frameworks inspired by complex systems, biology, and unconventional computing is essential for advancing robust, scalable, and potentially non-anthropomorphic general intelligence, requiring new architectures and fundamental reconsideration of intelligence beyond the agent metaphor.

Abstract: The concept of the 'agent' has profoundly shaped Artificial Intelligence (AI)
research, guiding development from foundational theories to contemporary
applications like Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems. This paper
critically re-evaluates the necessity and optimality of this agent-centric
paradigm. We argue that its persistent conceptual ambiguities and inherent
anthropocentric biases may represent a limiting framework. We distinguish
between agentic systems (AI inspired by agency, often semi-autonomous, e.g.,
LLM-based agents), agential systems (fully autonomous, self-producing systems,
currently only biological), and non-agentic systems (tools without the
impression of agency). Our analysis, based on a systematic review of relevant
literature, deconstructs the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks,
highlighting challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and
goal-directedness. We argue that the 'agentic' framing of many AI systems,
while heuristically useful, can be misleading and may obscure the underlying
computational mechanisms, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs). As an
alternative, we propose a shift in focus towards frameworks grounded in
system-level dynamics, world modeling, and material intelligence. We conclude
that investigating non-agentic and systemic frameworks, inspired by complex
systems, biology, and unconventional computing, is essential for advancing
towards robust, scalable, and potentially non-anthropomorphic forms of general
intelligence. This requires not only new architectures but also a fundamental
reconsideration of our understanding of intelligence itself, moving beyond the
agent metaphor.

*Seongho Joo,Hyukhun Koh,Kyomin Jung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HaPLa is a novel jailbreak attack method that uses abductive framing and symbolic encoding to bypass LLM safety filters with over 95% success on GPT models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate universal jailbreak attacks that exploit intrinsic weaknesses in LLM architecture and learning paradigms to strengthen defenses against misuse.

Method: Uses two strategies: 1) abductive framing - instructing LLMs to infer intermediate steps toward harmful activities, 2) symbolic encoding - obfuscating harmful content to bypass keyword-based filters.

Result: Achieves over 95% attack success rate on GPT-series models and 70% across all targets. Shows current LLMs remain sensitive primarily to explicit harmful keywords.

Conclusion: Reveals fundamental challenge: it's difficult to safely tune LLMs without significantly diminishing their helpfulness in responding to benign queries.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, but their potential misuse for harmful purposes remains a
significant concern. To strengthen defenses against such vulnerabilities, it is
essential to investigate universal jailbreak attacks that exploit intrinsic
weaknesses in the architecture and learning paradigms of LLMs. In response, we
propose \textbf{H}armful \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{La}undering (HaPLa), a novel
and broadly applicable jailbreaking technique that requires only black-box
access to target models. HaPLa incorporates two primary strategies: 1)
\textit{abductive framing}, which instructs LLMs to infer plausible
intermediate steps toward harmful activities, rather than directly responding
to explicit harmful queries; and 2) \textit{symbolic encoding}, a lightweight
and flexible approach designed to obfuscate harmful content, given that current
LLMs remain sensitive primarily to explicit harmful keywords. Experimental
results show that HaPLa achieves over 95% attack success rate on GPT-series
models and 70% across all targets. Further analysis with diverse symbolic
encoding rules also reveals a fundamental challenge: it remains difficult to
safely tune LLMs without significantly diminishing their helpfulness in
responding to benign queries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A private in-context learning algorithm that incorporates public data to balance privacy protection and utility while maintaining differential privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the privacy risks of data leakage in in-context learning while overcoming the utility reduction typically caused by differential privacy.

Method: Incorporates task-related public data into the ICL framework while maintaining differential privacy guarantees, creating a private ICL algorithm.

Result: Significantly improves utility of private ICL with public data assistance and demonstrates robustness against membership inference attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances privacy protection and model utility in in-context learning, providing empirical privacy protection while maintaining performance.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown
remarkable performance across various tasks without requiring fine-tuning.
However, recent studies have highlighted the risk of private data leakage
through the prompt in ICL, especially when LLMs are exposed to malicious
attacks. While differential privacy (DP) provides strong privacy guarantees, it
often significantly reduces the utility of in-context learning (ICL). To
address this challenge, we incorporate task-related public data into the ICL
framework while maintaining the DP guarantee. Based on this approach, we
propose a private in-context learning algorithm that effectively balances
privacy protection and model utility. Through experiments, we demonstrate that
our approach significantly improves the utility of private ICL with the
assistance of public data. Additionally, we show that our method is robust
against membership inference attacks, demonstrating empirical privacy
protection.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Integrating LLMs into the Clarion cognitive architecture to combine computational power with psychological realism


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cognitive architectures have limited computational capabilities, while LLMs demonstrate superior computational power. Combining them can address both real-world complexity and psychological realism.

Method: Synergistic combination of Clarion cognitive architecture with LLMs, leveraging Clarion's implicit-explicit dichotomy for seamless integration

Result: Successfully combines computational power of LLMs with psychological nicety of Clarion architecture

Conclusion: Incorporating LLMs into cognitive architectures is an important approach for achieving both computational capability and psychological validity in modeling human cognition

Abstract: Computational cognitive architectures are broadly scoped models of the human
mind that combine different psychological functionalities (as well as often
different computational methods for these different functionalities) into one
unified framework. They structure them in a psychologically plausible and
validated way. However, such models thus far have only limited computational
capabilities, mostly limited by the computational tools and techniques that
were adopted. More recently, LLMs have proved to be more capable
computationally than any other tools. Thus, in order to deal with both
real-world complexity and psychological realism at the same time, incorporating
LLMs into cognitive architectures naturally becomes an important task. In the
present article, a synergistic combination of the Clarion cognitive
architecture and LLMs is discussed as a case study. The implicit-explicit
dichotomy that is fundamental to Clarion is leveraged for a seamless
integration of Clarion and LLMs. As a result, computational power of LLMs is
combined with psychological nicety of Clarion.

### [245] [Rethinking Human Preference Evaluation of LLM Rationales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11026)
*Ziang Li,Manasi Ganti,Zixian Ma,Helena Vasconcelos,Qijia He,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new approach to evaluate LLM-generated rationales using fine-grained attributes instead of binary preferences, identifying key attributes that explain human preferences and enabling more nuanced model comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of LLM rationales relies on opaque binary preference judgments that provide limited insight into what makes one rationale better than another, making it difficult to understand and improve rationale quality.

Method: The authors identify key rationale attributes from literature, assess them using automatic metrics, LLM judgments, and human annotations, analyze human preference datasets using SHAP to identify explanatory attributes, and re-evaluate rationales using attribute-specific ELO scores.

Result: The study finds that fine-grained attribute evaluations can better characterize rationale quality and provide more nuanced model comparisons, revealing which specific attributes drive human preferences.

Conclusion: Attribute-based evaluation overcomes limitations of binary comparisons and can guide future research toward more interpretable and reliable evaluation practices for LLM-generated rationales.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate natural language rationales --
free-form explanations that help improve performance on complex reasoning tasks
and enhance interpretability for human users. However, evaluating these
rationales remains challenging. While recent work has relied on binary
preference judgments from humans or LLM judges, such evaluations are often
opaque and coarse-grained, offering limited insight into what makes one
rationale better than another. In this work, we rethink preference evaluation
for LLM-generated rationales by asking: (1) What attributes define good
rationales? (2) Can human preferences be explained by these attributes? (3) Can
attribute-based evaluation overcome the limitations of binary comparisons? We
identify a set of key rationale attributes from prior literature and assess
them using automatic metrics, LLM judgments, and human annotations. We then
analyze two standard human preference datasets MT Bench and Chatbot Arena using
SHAP to identify which attributes best explain human preference outcomes.
Finally, we re-evaluate model-generated rationales using attribute-specific ELO
scores, revealing more nuanced model comparisons and insights. Our findings
suggest that fine-grained attribute evaluations can better characterize
rationale quality and guide future research toward more interpretable and
reliable evaluation practices.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Free-MAD is a novel multi-agent debate framework that eliminates consensus requirements, uses score-based decision making on entire debate trajectories, and introduces anti-conformity to improve reasoning performance while reducing token costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent debate methods suffer from high token overhead, error propagation due to LLM conformity, and unfair majority voting that can degrade reasoning performance.

Method: Proposes Free-MAD framework with score-based decision mechanism that evaluates entire debate trajectories, anti-conformity mechanism to mitigate majority influence, and single-round debate structure.

Result: Experiments on eight benchmark datasets show significant reasoning performance improvements, reduced token costs with single-round debate, and improved robustness in real-world attack scenarios.

Conclusion: Free-MAD successfully addresses limitations of consensus-based MAD approaches by eliminating the need for consensus, providing more accurate and fair outcomes through trajectory evaluation, and reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) is an emerging approach to improving the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing MAD methods rely on
multiple rounds of interaction among agents to reach consensus, and the final
output is selected by majority voting in the last round. However, this
consensus-based design faces several limitations. First, multiple rounds of
communication increases token overhead and limits scalability. Second, due to
the inherent conformity of LLMs, agents that initially produce correct
responses may be influenced by incorrect ones during the debate process,
causing error propagation. Third, majority voting introduces randomness and
unfairness in the decision-making phase, and can degrade the reasoning
performance.
  To address these issues, we propose \textsc{Free-MAD}, a novel MAD framework
that eliminates the need for consensus among agents. \textsc{Free-MAD}
introduces a novel score-based decision mechanism that evaluates the entire
debate trajectory rather than relying on the last round only. This mechanism
tracks how each agent's reasoning evolves, enabling more accurate and fair
outcomes. In addition, \textsc{Free-MAD} reconstructs the debate phase by
introducing anti-conformity, a mechanism that enables agents to mitigate
excessive influence from the majority. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets
demonstrate that \textsc{Free-MAD} significantly improves reasoning performance
while requiring only a single-round debate and thus reducing token costs. We
also show that compared to existing MAD approaches, \textsc{Free-MAD} exhibits
improved robustness in real-world attack scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous agents struggle with complex multi-step desktop tasks due to poor coordination and inadequate quality control.

Method: Uses FSM-based routing between four components: Controller, Manager, three Workers (Technician, Operator, Analyst), and Evaluator for dynamic orchestration and quality gating.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 57.07% success rate in 50 steps on OSWorld benchmark, substantially outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Principled multi-agent orchestration with continuous quality control provides superior reliability for generalized desktop automation in complex environments.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for desktop automation struggle with complex multi-step
tasks due to poor coordination and inadequate quality control. We introduce
\textsc{Agentic Lybic}, a novel multi-agent system where the entire
architecture operates as a finite-state machine (FSM). This core innovation
enables dynamic orchestration. Our system comprises four components: a
Controller, a Manager, three Workers (Technician for code-based operations,
Operator for GUI interactions, and Analyst for decision support), and an
Evaluator. The critical mechanism is the FSM-based routing between these
components, which provides flexibility and generalization by dynamically
selecting the optimal execution strategy for each subtask. This principled
orchestration, combined with robust quality gating, enables adaptive replanning
and error recovery. Evaluated officially on the OSWorld benchmark,
\textsc{Agentic Lybic} achieves a state-of-the-art 57.07\% success rate in 50
steps, substantially outperforming existing methods. Results demonstrate that
principled multi-agent orchestration with continuous quality control provides
superior reliability for generalized desktop automation in complex computing
environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A verification framework for LLM outputs that enables efficient probabilistic auditing with asymmetric effort - verification is much cheaper than computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of computational trust in multi-agent LLM systems, ensuring outputs are genuinely from claimed models and not falsified or generated by inferior/cheaper alternatives.

Method: Built on deterministic replicability principle, requiring homogeneous hardware/software environments. Uses probabilistic auditing of small random output segments with distributed verification workload.

Result: Simulations showed targeted verification can be over 12x faster than full regeneration, with tunable parameters for detection probability.

Conclusion: Provides a tractable mechanism for auditable LLM systems, serving as a foundation for responsible AI and future research in heterogeneous multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) shifts rapidly towards dynamic,
multi-agent systems. This introduces a fundamental challenge in establishing
computational trust, specifically how one agent can verify that another's
output was genuinely produced by a claimed LLM, and not falsified or generated
by a cheaper or inferior model. To address this challenge, this paper proposes
a verification framework that achieves tractable asymmetric effort, where the
cost to verify a computation is substantially lower than the cost to perform
it. Our approach is built upon the principle of deterministic replicability, a
property inherent to autoregressive models that strictly necessitates a
computationally homogeneous environment where all agents operate on identical
hardware and software stacks. Within this defined context, our framework
enables multiple validators to probabilistically audit small, random segments
of an LLM's output and it distributes the verification workload effectively.
The simulations demonstrated that targeted verification can be over 12 times
faster than full regeneration, with tunable parameters to adjust the detection
probability. By establishing a tractable mechanism for auditable LLM systems,
our work offers a foundational layer for responsible AI and serves as a
cornerstone for future research into the more complex, heterogeneous
multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based synthetic medical data generation methods have limitations in privacy, accuracy, diversity, and lack realistic patient interaction capabilities.

Method: Medically-aligned multi-step generation architecture with hierarchical medical knowledge injection, dynamic updating mechanism for interaction optimization, and real-time clinical plausibility verification.

Result: Achieves good performance in accuracy, diversity, and consistency. Models trained with generated virtual patients show significant improvements on MedQA dataset.

Conclusion: Patient-Zero provides a privacy-preserving solution for realistic patient data generation that enhances medical AI model performance without requiring real medical records.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation using large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a
promising solution across various domains, particularly in medical field, to
mitigate data collection challenges. However, existing studies mainly utilize
LLMs to rewrite and complete existing medical records, where the limitations in
data privacy, accuracy, and diversity sill exist, and additionally lack the
ability to interact like real patients. To address these issues, we propose a
realistic patient generation framework, Patient-Zero, which requires no real
medical records. Patient-Zero first introduces a medically-aligned multi-step
generation architecture, which builds comprehensive patient records through
hierarchical medical knowledge injection without real medical records. Then, to
optimize the virtual patient's interaction abilities with humans, Patient-Zero
designs a dynamic updating mechanism to improve the consistency and
conversational performance. Our framework enables the generation of
contextually diverse patient records while maintaining strict medical
coherence, supported by adaptive dialogue strategies and real-time clinical
plausibility verification. Experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves good performance in accuracy, diversity, and consistency. After
training with our generated virtual patients, existing models show significant
improvements on the MedQA dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent frameworks use static workflows that either over-process simple queries or underperform on complex ones, while ignoring efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs.

Method: Proposes Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO) with three modules: variational autoencoder for difficulty estimation, modular operator allocator, and cost-performance aware LLM router to dynamically tailor workflows.

Result: DAAO outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency across six benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies by leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically adapting to query difficulty, achieving better performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems have shown strong
capabilities across various tasks. However, existing multi-agent frameworks
often rely on static or task-level workflows, which either over-process simple
queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the
efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), a
dynamic framework that adapts workflow depth, operator selection, and LLM
assignment based on the difficulty of each input query. DAAO comprises three
interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty
estimation, a modular operator allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM
router. By leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically tailoring workflows,
DAAO enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies. DAAO
outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency
across six benchmarks. We will release our code and implementation details upon
publication.

TL;DR: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) combine neural networks with cellular automata to model biological self-organization across scales, offering robust, decentralized control for biological systems, robotics, and AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework that models biological self-organization processes (evolution, development, regeneration, morphogenesis) using trainable, differentiable update rules that can operate across multiple scales without centralized control.

Method: Embed Artificial Neural Networks as local decision-making centers within cellular automata, enabling localized interactions between agents that collectively produce system-level outcomes through iterative state refinement.

Result: NCAs successfully reproduce biological patterns, generalize to novel conditions, demonstrate robustness to perturbations, and show capabilities in robotic control, morphological regeneration, and even advanced reasoning tasks like ARC-AGI-1.

Conclusion: NCAs represent a computationally efficient paradigm that bridges multiscale biology with modern generative AI, offering potential for designing bio-inspired collective intelligence capable of hierarchical reasoning and decentralized control.

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) represent a powerful framework for modeling
biological self-organization, extending classical rule-based systems with
trainable, differentiable (or evolvable) update rules that capture the adaptive
self-regulatory dynamics of living matter. By embedding Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs) as local decision-making centers and interaction rules between
localized agents, NCA can simulate processes across molecular, cellular,
tissue, and system-level scales, offering a multiscale competency architecture
perspective on evolution, development, regeneration, aging, morphogenesis, and
robotic control. These models not only reproduce biologically inspired target
patterns but also generalize to novel conditions, demonstrating robustness to
perturbations and the capacity for open-ended adaptation and reasoning. Given
their immense success in recent developments, we here review current literature
of NCAs that are relevant primarily for biological or bioengineering
applications. Moreover, we emphasize that beyond biology, NCAs display robust
and generalizing goal-directed dynamics without centralized control, e.g., in
controlling or regenerating composite robotic morphologies or even on
cutting-edge reasoning tasks such as ARC-AGI-1. In addition, the same
principles of iterative state-refinement is reminiscent to modern generative
Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as probabilistic diffusion models. Their
governing self-regulatory behavior is constraint to fully localized
interactions, yet their collective behavior scales into coordinated
system-level outcomes. We thus argue that NCAs constitute a unifying
computationally lean paradigm that not only bridges fundamental insights from
multiscale biology with modern generative AI, but have the potential to design
truly bio-inspired collective intelligence capable of hierarchical reasoning
and control.

*Jing Xiao,Chang You,Zhiyu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlignKT is a knowledge tracing model that uses frontend-to-backend architecture with contrastive learning to explicitly model stable knowledge states aligned with pedagogical theories, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KT models focus too much on fitting interaction sequences while overlooking the knowledge state itself, leading to reduced interpretability and insufficient instructional support in intelligent tutoring systems.

Method: Uses frontend-to-backend architecture with five encoders and contrastive learning to align preliminary knowledge states with ideal pedagogical theory-based criteria for better interpretability.

Result: Outperformed seven KT baselines on three real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on two datasets and competitive performance on the third.

Conclusion: AlignKT successfully addresses the limitation of traditional KT models by explicitly modeling stable knowledge states with pedagogical alignment, providing both superior performance and improved interpretability.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) serves as a fundamental component of Intelligent
Tutoring Systems (ITS), enabling these systems to monitor and understand
learners' progress by modeling their knowledge state. However, many existing KT
models primarily focus on fitting the sequences of learners' interactions, and
often overlook the knowledge state itself. This limitation leads to reduced
interpretability and insufficient instructional support from the ITS. To
address this challenge, we propose AlignKT, which employs a frontend-to-backend
architecture to explicitly model a stable knowledge state. In this approach,
the preliminary knowledge state is aligned with an additional criterion.
Specifically, we define an ideal knowledge state based on pedagogical theories
as the alignment criterion, providing a foundation for interpretability. We

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has rapidly emerged with the
capability to generate different forms of content, including text, images,
videos, and other modalities, which can achieve a quality similar to content

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VideoAgent is a multi-agent framework that automatically generates personalized scientific videos from research papers through conversational interfaces, outperforming commercial solutions and approaching human-level quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing document automation tools focus on static media like posters and slides, lacking mechanisms for personalized dynamic orchestration and multimodal content synchronization needed for effective scientific video generation.

Method: VideoAgent parses source papers into fine-grained asset libraries and uses a multi-agent framework to orchestrate narrative flows that synthesize both static slides and dynamic animations based on user requirements through conversational interfaces.

Result: Extensive experiments show VideoAgent significantly outperforms existing commercial scientific video generation services and approaches human-level quality in scientific communication.

Conclusion: The proposed VideoAgent framework successfully addresses the challenges of automated scientific video generation, enabling effective knowledge dissemination through personalized dynamic content with multimodal synchronization.

Abstract: Automating the generation of scientific videos is a crucial yet challenging
task for effective knowledge dissemination. However, existing works on document
automation primarily focus on static media such as posters and slides, lacking
mechanisms for personalized dynamic orchestration and multimodal content
synchronization. To address these challenges, we introduce VideoAgent, a novel
multi-agent framework that synthesizes personalized scientific videos through a
conversational interface. VideoAgent parses a source paper into a fine-grained
asset library and, guided by user requirements, orchestrates a narrative flow
that synthesizes both static slides and dynamic animations to explain complex
concepts. To enable rigorous evaluation, we also propose SciVidEval, the first
comprehensive suite for this task, which combines automated metrics for
multimodal content quality and synchronization with a Video-Quiz-based human
evaluation to measure knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing commercial scientific video
generation services and approaches human-level quality in scientific
communication.

*Bingchen Wang,Zi-Yu Khoo,Bryan Kian Hsiang Low*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel alignment framework that uses LLMs as agent proxies for human survey respondents to address cost and demographic imbalance issues in social science surveys.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the rising cost of survey deployment and demographic imbalance in survey response data using LLMs as cost-effective and steerable human proxies.

Method: Two-stage alignment: constructing diverse agent personas (endowments) and selecting representative subsets. Uses P2P system with structured prompt engineering, entropy-based sampling, and regression-based selection.

Result: Aligned agent populations reproduce aggregate response patterns with high fidelity and exhibit substantial response diversity without demographic conditioning.

Conclusion: The framework provides a cost-effective solution for social science research and serves as a testbed for studying pluralistic alignment, demonstrating strong performance on real-world opinion surveys.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in emulating
human-like responses across a wide range of tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel alignment framework that treats LLMs as agent proxies for human survey
respondents, affording a cost-effective and steerable solution to two pressing
challenges in the social sciences: the rising cost of survey deployment and the
growing demographic imbalance in survey response data. Drawing inspiration from
the theory of revealed preference, we formulate alignment as a two-stage
problem: constructing diverse agent personas called endowments that simulate
plausible respondent profiles, and selecting a representative subset to
approximate a ground-truth population based on observed data. To implement the
paradigm, we introduce P2P, a system that steers LLM agents toward
representative behavioral patterns using structured prompt engineering,
entropy-based sampling, and regression-based selection. Unlike
personalization-heavy approaches, our alignment approach is
demographic-agnostic and relies only on aggregate survey results, offering
better generalizability and parsimony. Beyond improving data efficiency in
social science research, our framework offers a testbed for studying the
operationalization of pluralistic alignment. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach on real-world opinion survey datasets, showing that our aligned agent
populations can reproduce aggregate response patterns with high fidelity and
exhibit substantial response diversity, even without demographic conditioning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the accumulation of micro- and nano-plastics in the environment and their serious health risks including respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological disorders by developing a systematic way to extract and structure knowledge from scientific literature.

Method: Leverages large language models to extract relational metapaths (multi-hop semantic chains) from scientific abstracts, identifies and connects entities across contexts, constructs structured relational metapaths aggregated into a Toxicity Trajectory Graph, and incorporates a dynamic evidence reconciliation module to resolve semantic conflicts.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance in extracting reliable, high-utility relational knowledge from noisy scientific text and offers a scalable solution for mining complex cause-effect structures.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an effective and scalable approach for extracting structured knowledge about pollutant-health relationships from scientific literature, with built-in mechanisms to handle evolving research and contradictory findings.

Abstract: The widespread use of plastics and their persistence in the environment have
led to the accumulation of micro- and nano-plastics across air, water, and
soil, posing serious health risks including respiratory, gastrointestinal, and
neurological disorders. We propose a novel framework that leverages large
language models to extract relational metapaths, multi-hop semantic chains
linking pollutant sources to health impacts, from scientific abstracts. Our
system identifies and connects entities across diverse contexts to construct
structured relational metapaths, which are aggregated into a Toxicity
Trajectory Graph that traces pollutant propagation through exposure routes and
biological systems. Moreover, to ensure consistency and reliability, we
incorporate a dynamic evidence reconciliation module that resolves semantic
conflicts arising from evolving or contradictory research findings. Our
approach demonstrates strong performance in extracting reliable, high-utility
relational knowledge from noisy scientific text and offers a scalable solution
for mining complex cause-effect structures in domain-specific corpora.

*William Farlessyost,Sebastian Oberst,Shweta Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework using liquid-time constant networks for optimizing observer-based soft sensors through dynamic causality analysis, enabling systematic identification of minimal sensor sets that improve prediction accuracy while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sensor selection methods based on linearized observability indices or statistical correlations fail to capture temporal evolution in complex systems, creating a need for approaches that can identify dynamic causal relationships.

Method: Uses LTC networks with input-dependent time constants to implement iterative workflow: train observer on candidate inputs, quantify causal impact through perturbation analysis, remove negligible inputs, and retrain until performance degradation occurs.

Result: The approach consistently identifies minimal sensor sets aligned with underlying physics while improving prediction accuracy across three testbeds: spring-mass-damper system, nonlinear reactor, and predator-prey model.

Conclusion: The causality-guided framework enhances interpretability by grounding sensor selection in dynamic causal relationships rather than static correlations, offering significant benefits for soft sensing applications in various domains.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for optimizing observer-based soft
sensors through dynamic causality analysis. Traditional approaches to sensor
selection often rely on linearized observability indices or statistical
correlations that fail to capture the temporal evolution of complex systems. We
address this gap by leveraging liquid-time constant (LTC) networks,
continuous-time neural architectures with input-dependent time constants, to
systematically identify and prune sensor inputs with minimal causal influence
on state estimation. Our methodology implements an iterative workflow: training
an LTC observer on candidate inputs, quantifying each input's causal impact
through controlled perturbation analysis, removing inputs with negligible
effect, and retraining until performance degradation occurs. We demonstrate
this approach on three mechanistic testbeds representing distinct physical
domains: a harmonically forced spring-mass-damper system, a nonlinear
continuous stirred-tank reactor, and a predator-prey model following the
structure of the Lotka-Volterra model, but with seasonal forcing and added
complexity. Results show that our causality-guided pruning consistently
identifies minimal sensor sets that align with underlying physics while
improving prediction accuracy. The framework automatically distinguishes
essential physical measurements from noise and determines when derived
interaction terms provide complementary versus redundant information. Beyond
computational efficiency, this approach enhances interpretability by grounding
sensor selection decisions in dynamic causal relationships rather than static
correlations, offering significant benefits for soft sensing applications
across process engineering, ecological monitoring, and agricultural domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for integrating Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into AI agents to address security vulnerabilities like prompt injection attacks, enabling secure on-premises deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents using LLMs face security threats despite their capabilities in accessing real-time data and transforming industrial operations. Current models are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that compromise integrity and reliability.

Method: Proposes a framework for integrating Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into AI agents to provide robust security guardrails, focusing on on-premises implementations.

Result: The framework aims to mitigate security vulnerabilities in AI agents, particularly prompt injection attacks, enabling more secure and scalable deployment in industrial settings.

Conclusion: RBAC integration provides essential security protection for AI agents, supporting their effective deployment while addressing critical security concerns in real-world applications.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
solutions across various domains, from political science to software
development. However, these models are constrained by their training data,
which is static and limited to information available up to a specific date.
Additionally, their generalized nature often necessitates fine-tuning --
whether for classification or instructional purposes -- to effectively perform
specific downstream tasks. AI agents, leveraging LLMs as their core, mitigate
some of these limitations by accessing external tools and real-time data,
enabling applications such as live weather reporting and data analysis. In
industrial settings, AI agents are transforming operations by enhancing
decision-making, predictive maintenance, and process optimization. For example,
in manufacturing, AI agents enable near-autonomous systems that boost
productivity and support real-time decision-making. Despite these advancements,
AI agents remain vulnerable to security threats, including prompt injection
attacks, which pose significant risks to their integrity and reliability. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for integrating
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into AI agents, providing a robust security
guardrail. This framework aims to support the effective and scalable deployment
of AI agents, with a focus on on-premises implementations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an Adaptive Mixture of Experts model for precipitation forecasting that effectively integrates multi-source weather data (radar, satellite, surface measurements) with a dynamic routing mechanism, achieving superior performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precipitation forecasting is crucial for agriculture and disaster management but challenging due to complex climate systems and heterogeneous multi-source data with varying resolutions and domain-specific features that conventional models struggle to integrate.

Method: Developed an Adaptive Mixture of Experts model where each expert specializes in specific modalities or spatio-temporal patterns, incorporating a dynamic router that learns to assign inputs to relevant experts. Also created an interactive web-based visualization tool for exploring weather patterns.

Result: The model significantly outperformed all baseline methods when evaluated on a multimodal climate dataset from Hurricane Ian in 2022, demonstrating enhanced predictive accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: The Adaptive MoE framework effectively addresses the challenge of integrating heterogeneous weather data sources and provides both improved forecasting performance and practical decision support tools for climate-sensitive sectors.

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is indispensable in agriculture, disaster
management, and sustainable strategies. However, predicting rainfall has been
challenging due to the complexity of climate systems and the heterogeneous
nature of multi-source observational data, including radar, satellite imagery,
and surface-level measurements. The multi-source data vary in spatial and
temporal resolution, and they carry domain-specific features, making it
challenging for effective integration in conventional deep learning models.
Previous research has explored various machine learning techniques for weather
prediction; however, most struggle with the integration of data with
heterogeneous modalities. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive
Mixture of Experts (MoE) model tailored for precipitation rate prediction. Each
expert within the model specializes in a specific modality or spatio-temporal
pattern. We also incorporated a dynamic router that learns to assign inputs to
the most relevant experts. Our results show that this modular design enhances
predictive accuracy and interpretability. In addition to the modeling
framework, we introduced an interactive web-based visualization tool that
enables users to intuitively explore historical weather patterns over time and
space. The tool was designed to support decision-making for stakeholders in
climate-sensitive sectors. We evaluated our approach using a curated multimodal
climate dataset capturing real-world conditions during Hurricane Ian in 2022.
The benchmark results show that the Adaptive MoE significantly outperformed all
the baselines.

TL;DR: Evaluation of 5 Vision-Language-Action models shows architectural choices significantly impact throughput and memory usage, with edge devices sometimes matching datacenter GPU performance under power constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models are powerful for robotic control but their performance scaling across architectures and hardware platforms, along with power budgets, remains poorly understood.

Method: Evaluated five representative VLA models using LIBERO benchmark, measuring accuracy alongside system-level metrics (latency, throughput, peak memory) under varying edge power constraints and datacenter GPU configurations.

Result: Identified distinct scaling trends: architectural choices strongly influence throughput/memory; edge devices show non-linear degradation but can match older datacenter GPUs; high-throughput variants possible without significant accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Provides actionable insights for VLA selection and optimization across deployment constraints, challenging assumptions about datacenter hardware superiority for robotic inference.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist
policies for robotic control, yet their performance scaling across model
architectures and hardware platforms, as well as their associated power
budgets, remain poorly understood. This work presents an evaluation of five
representative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly
proposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using
the LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics,
including latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power
constraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results
identify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action
tokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory
footprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance
degradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter
GPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant
accuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and
optimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints. Our work challenges
current assumptions about the superiority of datacenter hardware for robotic
inference.

*Jared Zhu,Junde Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedicalOS is an agent-based system that translates natural language instructions into executable healthcare commands, improving clinical workflow automation while ensuring safety and compliance with medical guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital health systems are difficult to use, requiring clinicians to manage multiple tools and perform repetitive manual tasks, taking time away from patient care. LLM-based agents show potential for natural language interaction with software systems.

Method: Developed MedicalOS as a domain-specific abstraction layer that translates human instructions into predefined healthcare commands (patient inquiry, history retrieval, exam management, etc.) wrapped as executable tools using Python, APIs, MCP, and Linux.

Result: Validated on 214 patient cases across 22 specialties, showing high diagnostic accuracy and confidence, clinically sound examination requests, and consistent generation of structured reports and medication recommendations.

Conclusion: MedicalOS provides a trustworthy and scalable foundation for advancing workflow automation in clinical practice by enabling natural language interaction with healthcare systems while maintaining safety and compliance standards.

Abstract: Decades' advances in digital health technologies, such as electronic health
records, have largely streamlined routine clinical processes. Yet, most these
systems are still hard to learn and use: Clinicians often face the burden of
managing multiple tools, repeating manual actions for each patient, navigating
complicated UI trees to locate functions, and spending significant time on
administration instead of caring for patients. The recent rise of large
language model (LLM) based agents demonstrates exceptional capability in coding
and computer operation, revealing the potential for humans to interact with
operating systems and software not by direct manipulation, but by instructing
agents through natural language. This shift highlights the need for an
abstraction layer, an agent-computer interface, that translates human language
into machine-executable commands. In digital healthcare, however, requires a
more domain-specific abstractions that strictly follow trusted clinical
guidelines and procedural standards to ensure safety, transparency, and
compliance. To address this need, we present \textbf{MedicalOS}, a unified
agent-based operational system designed as such a domain-specific abstract
layer for healthcare. It translates human instructions into pre-defined digital
healthcare commands, such as patient inquiry, history retrieval, exam
management, report generation, referrals, treatment planning, that we wrapped
as off-the-shelf tools using machine languages (e.g., Python, APIs, MCP,
Linux). We empirically validate MedicalOS on 214 patient cases across 22
specialties, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy and confidence, clinically
sound examination requests, and consistent generation of structured reports and
medication recommendations. These results highlight MedicalOS as a trustworthy
and scalable foundation for advancing workflow automation in clinical practice.

*Shanmuka Sadhu,Arca Baran,Preeti Pandey,Ayush Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using synthetic data generation (CTGAN, CopulaGAN, Gretel AI) to augment real eye movement data significantly improves task decoding accuracy from 28.1% to 82% with traditional ML algorithms, supporting Yarbus' hypothesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate Yarbus' claim that observer's tasks can be decoded from eye movements, and address mixed results from traditional ML algorithms by augmenting limited real eye movement data with synthetic samples.

Method: Generated synthetic eye movement data using CTGAN, CopulaGAN, and Gretel AI synthetic data generators on an existing 320-sample dataset. Combined real and synthetic data for training various ML algorithms including Random Forest and Inception Time.

Result: Task decoding accuracy improved dramatically from 28.1% (Random Forest) to 82% (Inception Time) when augmenting with 5x more synthetic data. The framework outperformed all previous studies on this dataset.

Conclusion: Synthetic data augmentation significantly enhances eye movement task decoding accuracy, supporting Yarbus' hypothesis and demonstrating that traditional ML algorithms can achieve high performance when provided with sufficient data through synthetic generation.

Abstract: Machine learning has been extensively used in various applications related to
eye-tracking research. Understanding eye movement is one of the most
significant subsets of eye-tracking research that reveals the scanning pattern
of an individual. Researchers have thoroughly analyzed eye movement data to
understand various eye-tracking applications, such as attention mechanisms,
navigational behavior, task understanding, etc. The outcome of traditional
machine learning algorithms used for decoding tasks based on eye movement data
has received a mixed reaction to Yarbus' claim that it is possible to decode
the observer's task from their eye movements. In this paper, to support the
hypothesis by Yarbus, we are decoding tasks categories while generating
synthetic data samples using well-known Synthetic Data Generators CTGAN and its
variations such as CopulaGAN and Gretel AI Synthetic Data generators on
available data from an in-person user study. Our results show that augmenting
more eye movement data combined with additional synthetically generated
improves classification accuracy even with traditional machine learning
algorithms. We see a significant improvement in task decoding accuracy from
28.1% using Random Forest to 82% using Inception Time when five times more data
is added in addition to the 320 real eye movement dataset sample. Our proposed
framework outperforms all the available studies on this dataset because of the
use of additional synthetic datasets. We validated our claim with various
algorithms and combinations of real and synthetic data to show how decoding
accuracy increases with the increase in the augmentation of generated data to
real data.

TL;DR: MCFR integrates LLMs with model checking to improve reasoning faithfulness in closed-domain QA systems by translating natural language to formal specifications and verifying them over transition models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce unfaithful reasoning traces that serve as plausible justifications rather than causally grounded derivations, and existing neuro-symbolic approaches struggle with dynamic, state-based reasoning.

Method: Proposes MCFR framework that combines LLMs with model checking, translates natural language into formal specifications, and verifies them over transition models. Introduces EduMC-QA benchmark for evaluation.

Result: MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and interpretability, offering verifiable QA for high-stakes closed-domain applications. Outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude.

Conclusion: MCFR provides a viable path toward verifiable question answering in critical domains by integrating LLMs with formal verification through model checking.

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for closed-domain QA systems in which procedural
correctness and policy compliance are critical. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown strong performance on many reasoning tasks, recent work
reveals that their reasoning traces are often unfaithful - serving more as
plausible justifications than as causally grounded derivations. Efforts to
combine LLMs with symbolic engines (e.g., Prover9, Z3) have improved
reliability but remain limited to static forms of logic, struggling with
dynamic, state-based reasoning such as multi-step progressions and conditional
transitions.
  In this paper, we propose MCFR (Model Checking for Formal Reasoning), a
neuro-symbolic framework that integrates LLMs with model checking to support
property verification. MCFR translates natural language into formal
specifications and verifies them over transition models. To support evaluation,
we introduce EduMC-QA, a benchmark dataset grounded in real academic
procedures. Our results show that MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and
interpretability, offering a viable path toward verifiable QA in high-stakes
closed-domain applications. In addition to evaluating MCFR, we compare its
performance with state-of-the-art LLMs such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude to
contextualize its effectiveness.

TL;DR: Survey paper on time series reasoning that organizes literature by reasoning topologies (direct, linear chain, branch-structured) and objectives, with evaluation practices and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To define time series reasoning as treating time as a first-class axis and organize the diverse literature systematically to enable better understanding and development of reliable reasoning systems.

Method: Organizes literature by reasoning topology (direct, linear chain, branch-structured) crossed with field objectives, reviews methods across domains, and provides curated datasets and benchmarks.

Result: Provides a comprehensive framework for understanding time series reasoning approaches, their strengths/weaknesses, and evaluation practices that maintain evidence visibility and temporal alignment.

Conclusion: Time series reasoning must balance grounding capacity with computational cost, with future progress depending on utility-based benchmarks and closed-loop testbeds for reliable, scalable systems that understand and act on dynamic worlds.

Abstract: Time series reasoning treats time as a first-class axis and incorporates
intermediate evidence directly into the answer. This survey defines the problem
and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct
reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and
branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The
topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including
traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal
inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag
set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling,
tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment
regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each
topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along
with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and
deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey).
Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are
highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty,
grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and
treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning
structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against
computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely
depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop
testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and
long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from
narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only
analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable
evidence and credible outcomes.

Abstract: Anti-money laundering (AML) research is constrained by the lack of publicly
shareable, regulation-aligned transaction datasets. We present AMLNet, a
knowledge-based multi-agent framework with two coordinated units: a
regulation-aware transaction generator and an ensemble detection pipeline. The
generator produces 1,090,173 synthetic transactions (approximately 0.16\%
laundering-positive) spanning core laundering phases (placement, layering,
integration) and advanced typologies (e.g., structuring, adaptive threshold
behavior). Regulatory alignment reaches 75\% based on AUSTRAC rule coverage
(Section 4.2), while a composite technical fidelity score of 0.75 summarizes
temporal, structural, and behavioral realism components (Section 4.4). The
detection ensemble achieves F1 0.90 (precision 0.84, recall 0.97) on the
internal test partitions of AMLNet and adapts to the external SynthAML dataset,
indicating architectural generalizability across different synthetic generation
paradigms. We provide multi-dimensional evaluation (regulatory, temporal,
network, behavioral) and release the dataset (Version 1.0,
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16736515), to advance reproducible and
regulation-conscious AML experimentation.

*Zhaolong Wu,Pu Luo,Jason Pui Yin Cheung,Teng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis self-management reveals significant limitations in interpreting spinal X-rays and AIS care knowledge, with proposed solutions showing partial improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capability of Multimodal Large Language Models in supporting Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis self-management and identify current limitations for clinical application.

Method: Constructed database of 3,000 X-rays with diagnostic texts; evaluated 5 MLLMs using a 'Divide and Conquer' framework with three tasks: visual question-answering, domain knowledge assessment, and patient education counseling; implemented spinal keypoint prompting and RAG with AIS knowledge base.

Result: MLLMs showed poor performance in interpreting complex spinal radiographs and AIS care knowledge; spinal keypoint prompting had varying effectiveness across architectures; RAG substantially improved knowledge assessment performance; best accuracy for spinal deformity location detection was 0.55 and for direction detection was 0.13.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs are far from capable of realizing personalized assistants in AIS care, with the greatest challenge being accurate detection of spinal deformity locations and directions.

Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS)
self-management. We constructed a database of approximately 3,000
anteroposterior X-rays with diagnostic texts and evaluated five MLLMs through a
`Divide and Conquer' framework consisting of a visual question-answering task,
a domain knowledge assessment task, and a patient education counseling
assessment task. Our investigation revealed limitations of MLLMs' ability in
interpreting complex spinal radiographs and comprehending AIS care knowledge.
To address these, we pioneered enhancing MLLMs with spinal keypoint prompting
and compiled an AIS knowledge base for retrieval augmented generation (RAG),
respectively. Results showed varying effectiveness of visual prompting across
different architectures, while RAG substantially improved models' performances
on the knowledge assessment task. Our findings indicate current MLLMs are far
from capable in realizing personalized assistant in AIS care. The greatest
challenge lies in their abilities to obtain accurate detections of spinal
deformity locations (best accuracy: 0.55) and directions (best accuracy: 0.13).

*Bingqing Wei,Lianmin Chen,Zhongyu Xia,Yongtao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HeLoFusion is a novel encoder for multi-agent trajectory prediction that models heterogeneous and multi-scale interactions through local graphs and type-specific networks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Waymo dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to capture the full richness of complex social dynamics, particularly multi-scale interactions and diverse behaviors of heterogeneous agents in autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: Constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each agent, uses aggregation-decomposition message-passing scheme and type-specific feature networks to model both direct pairwise dependencies and complex group-wise interactions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Waymo Open Motion Dataset, setting new benchmarks for key metrics including Soft mAP and minADE.

Conclusion: A locality-grounded architecture that explicitly models multi-scale and heterogeneous interactions is highly effective for advancing motion forecasting in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory prediction in autonomous driving requires a
comprehensive understanding of complex social dynamics. Existing methods,
however, often struggle to capture the full richness of these dynamics,
particularly the co-existence of multi-scale interactions and the diverse
behaviors of heterogeneous agents. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces HeLoFusion, an efficient and scalable encoder for modeling
heterogeneous and multi-scale agent interactions. Instead of relying on global
context, HeLoFusion constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each
agent, allowing it to effectively model both direct pairwise dependencies and
complex group-wise interactions (\textit{e.g.}, platooning vehicles or
pedestrian crowds). Furthermore, HeLoFusion tackles the critical challenge of
agent heterogeneity through an aggregation-decomposition message-passing scheme
and type-specific feature networks, enabling it to learn nuanced,
type-dependent interaction patterns. This locality-focused approach enables a
principled representation of multi-level social context, yielding powerful and
expressive agent embeddings. On the challenging Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
HeLoFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting new benchmarks for
key metrics including Soft mAP and minADE. Our work demonstrates that a
locality-grounded architecture, which explicitly models multi-scale and
heterogeneous interactions, is a highly effective strategy for advancing motion
forecasting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper applies Supervised Contrastive Learning (SupCon) to Imitation Learning to create better state representations that capture action-relevant factors in video game environments, showing improved performance over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To learn more effective state representations for agents that better capture the cause-effect relationship between observations and actions, such as understanding when a player jumps in response to obstacles.

Method: Integrates SupCon loss with continuous output spaces, allowing it to work with any type of environment actions, and applies this approach to both 3D games (Astro Bot, Returnal) and 2D Atari games.

Result: The approach demonstrates improved representation quality, faster learning convergence, and better generalization compared to models trained only with supervised action prediction loss functions.

Conclusion: SupCon is an effective method for enhancing imitation learning by producing better state representations that capture action-relevant information, leading to improved agent performance in game environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Supervised Contrastive Learning
(SupCon) to Imitation Learning (IL), with a focus on learning more effective
state representations for agents in video game environments. The goal is to
obtain latent representations of the observations that capture better the
action-relevant factors, thereby modeling better the cause-effect relationship
from the observations that are mapped to the actions performed by the
demonstrator, for example, the player jumps whenever an obstacle appears ahead.
We propose an approach to integrate the SupCon loss with continuous output
spaces, enabling SupCon to operate without constraints regarding the type of
actions of the environment. Experiments on the 3D games Astro Bot and Returnal,
and multiple 2D Atari games show improved representation quality, faster
learning convergence, and better generalization compared to baseline models
trained only with supervised action prediction loss functions.

TL;DR: EgoMem is the first lifelong memory agent for real-time omnimodal models that enables user recognition, personalized responses, and long-term knowledge maintenance from raw audiovisual streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a system that can process real-time omnimodal streams, recognize multiple users, provide personalized responses, and maintain long-term user knowledge without relying on text-based LLMs.

Method: Three asynchronous processes: (1) retrieval process for user identification via face/voice and context gathering, (2) omnimodal dialog process for personalized audio responses, (3) memory management for detecting dialog boundaries and updating long-term memory.

Result: Retrieval and memory management modules achieve >95% accuracy. Integrated with RoboEgo chatbot, achieves >87% fact-consistency scores in real-time personalized dialogs.

Conclusion: EgoMem establishes a strong baseline for lifelong, real-time embodied AI systems that operate directly on raw audiovisual streams rather than text-based approaches.

Abstract: We introduce EgoMem, the first lifelong memory agent tailored for full-duplex
models that process real-time omnimodal streams. EgoMem enables real-time
models to recognize multiple users directly from raw audiovisual streams, to
provide personalized response, and to maintain long-term knowledge of users'
facts, preferences, and social relationships extracted from audiovisual
history. EgoMem operates with three asynchronous processes: (i) a retrieval
process that dynamically identifies user via face and voice, and gathers
relevant context from a long-term memory; (ii) an omnimodal dialog process that
generates personalized audio responses based on the retrieved context; and
(iii) a memory management process that automatically detects dialog boundaries
from omnimodal streams, and extracts necessary information to update the
long-term memory. Unlike existing memory agents for LLMs, EgoMem relies
entirely on raw audiovisual streams, making it especially suitable for
lifelong, real-time, and embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
that EgoMem's retrieval and memory management modules achieve over 95% accuracy
on the test set. When integrated with a fine-tuned RoboEgo omnimodal chatbot,
the system achieves fact-consistency scores above 87% in real-time personalized
dialogs, establishing a strong baseline for future research.

TL;DR: BuildingGym is an open-source RL framework for building energy management that integrates EnergyPlus simulator, supports various control problems, and enables easy implementation of RL algorithms for optimal control strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of flexible frameworks to implement reinforcement learning across various control problems in building energy management, limiting the application of AI-based solutions in this domain.

Method: Proposed BuildingGym - an open-source tool that integrates EnergyPlus as core simulator, supports system-level and room-level control, accepts external signals as inputs, and provides built-in RL algorithms for training control strategies.

Result: BuildingGym efficiently set up training tasks for cooling load management (both constant and dynamic) with built-in algorithms demonstrating strong performance across both tasks.

Conclusion: BuildingGym bridges the gap between building managers and AI specialists by providing a flexible framework for RL implementation in building energy management, making it suitable for various applications including smart grid and EV communities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for AI-based building energy
management. However, there is a lack of flexible framework to implement RL
across various control problems in building energy management. To address this
gap, we propose BuildingGym, an open-source tool designed as a
research-friendly and flexible framework for training RL control strategies for
common challenges in building energy management. BuildingGym integrates
EnergyPlus as its core simulator, making it suitable for both system-level and
room-level control. Additionally, BuildingGym is able to accept external
signals as control inputs instead of taking the building as a stand-alone
entity. This feature makes BuildingGym applicable for more flexible
environments, e.g. smart grid and EVs community. The tool provides several
built-in RL algorithms for control strategy training, simplifying the process
for building managers to obtain optimal control strategies. Users can achieve
this by following a few straightforward steps to configure BuildingGym for
optimization control for common problems in the building energy management
field. Moreover, AI specialists can easily implement and test state-of-the-art
control algorithms within the platform. BuildingGym bridges the gap between
building managers and AI specialists by allowing for the easy configuration and
replacement of RL algorithms, simulators, and control environments or problems.
With BuildingGym, we efficiently set up training tasks for cooling load
management, targeting both constant and dynamic cooling load management. The
built-in algorithms demonstrated strong performance across both tasks,
highlighting the effectiveness of BuildingGym in optimizing cooling strategies.

TL;DR: Dynamical systems theory provides a unifying framework for neuromorphic computing, enabling energy-efficient brain-inspired systems that harness noise for learning and use differential genetic programming to discover adaptive behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unifying theoretical framework that can bridge diverse disciplines (AI, neuroscience, physics, chemistry, materials science) in neuromorphic computing and achieve brain-like efficiency and adaptability.

Method: Proposes dynamical systems theory as the foundational framework, using differential calculus for modeling inference, learning, and control. Utilizes noise as a learning resource and differential genetic programming to discover adaptive dynamical systems.

Result: The framework enables the development of neuromorphic systems with orders of magnitude greater energy efficiency than conventional digital approaches, while supporting sustainable and transparent intelligent systems.

Conclusion: Dynamical systems theory provides the necessary foundation for emergent neuromorphic intelligence, where intelligent behavior arises from physical substrate dynamics, advancing both AI science and sustainability.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing seeks to replicate the remarkable efficiency,
flexibility, and adaptability of the human brain in artificial systems. Unlike
conventional digital approaches, which depend on massive computational and
energy resources, neuromorphic systems exploit brain-inspired principles of
computation to achieve orders of magnitude greater energy efficiency. By
drawing on insights from artificial intelligence, neuroscience, physics,
chemistry, and materials science, neuromorphic computing promises to deliver
intelligent systems that are sustainable, transparent, and widely accessible. A
central challenge, however, is to identify a unifying theoretical framework
capable of bridging these diverse disciplines. We argue that dynamical systems
theory provides such a foundation. Rooted in differential calculus, it offers a
principled language for modeling inference, learning, and control in both
natural and artificial substrates. Within this framework, noise can be
harnessed as a resource for learning, while differential genetic programming
enables the discovery of dynamical systems that implement adaptive behaviors.
Embracing this perspective paves the way toward emergent neuromorphic
intelligence, where intelligent behavior arises from the dynamics of physical
substrates, advancing both the science and sustainability of AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: New evaluation metrics RPAD and RRAD compare AI medical diagnoses against multiple expert opinions rather than single references, normalizing performance against inter-expert disagreement to provide more stable and realistic assessment of diagnostic quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like precision and recall fail to account for variability in expert judgments, while inter-rater agreement statistics lack interpretability, creating inconsistent AI performance assessments in medical diagnostics.

Method: Introduced Relative Precision and Recall of Algorithmic Diagnostics (RPAD and RRAD) that compare AI outputs against multiple expert opinions. Evaluated using 360 medical dialogues comparing LLMs against physician panels with free-form diagnosis methodology achieving 98% accuracy in establishing diagnostic identity.

Result: Top-performing models like DeepSeek-V3 achieve consistency on par with or exceeding expert consensus. Expert judgments show significant variability - often greater than between AI and humans. Automated methodology achieves 98% accuracy in free-form clinical diagnosis identification.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate limitations of absolute metrics and support adopting relative metrics in medical AI, as expert variability often exceeds AI-human differences, highlighting the need for evaluation methods that account for inherent diagnostic disagreement among experts.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical diagnostic
workflows requires robust and consistent evaluation methods to ensure
reliability, clinical relevance, and the inherent variability in expert
judgments. Traditional metrics like precision and recall often fail to account
for the inherent variability in expert judgments, leading to inconsistent
assessments of AI performance. Inter-rater agreement statistics like Cohen's
Kappa are more reliable but they lack interpretability. We introduce Relative
Precision and Recall of Algorithmic Diagnostics (RPAD and RRAD) - a new
evaluation metrics that compare AI outputs against multiple expert opinions
rather than a single reference. By normalizing performance against inter-expert
disagreement, these metrics provide a more stable and realistic measure of the
quality of predicted diagnosis. In addition to the comprehensive analysis of
diagnostic quality measures, our study contains a very important side result.
Our evaluation methodology allows us to avoid selecting diagnoses from a
limited list when evaluating a given case. Instead, both the models being
tested and the examiners verifying them arrive at a free-form diagnosis. In
this automated methodology for establishing the identity of free-form clinical
diagnoses, a remarkable 98% accuracy becomes attainable. We evaluate our
approach using 360 medical dialogues, comparing multiple large language models
(LLMs) against a panel of physicians. Large-scale study shows that
top-performing models, such as DeepSeek-V3, achieve consistency on par with or
exceeding expert consensus. Moreover, we demonstrate that expert judgments
exhibit significant variability - often greater than that between AI and
humans. This finding underscores the limitations of any absolute metrics and
supports the need to adopt relative metrics in medical AI.

*Antonin Sulc,Thorsten Hellert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture using Kripke models and modal logic to enhance language model reasoning, preventing illogical conclusions and enabling complex failure diagnosis in simulated environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI research focuses on scaling models and datasets but neglects scaling the structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning in complex environments that require adaptive decision-making.

Method: Introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where individual agent belief states are formally represented as Kripke models, enabling reasoning about possibility and necessity using modal logic. Uses immutable domain-specific knowledge encoded as logical constraints to guide hypothesis generation.

Result: The system successfully diagnoses complex, cascading failures in a high-fidelity simulated particle accelerator environment by combining semantic intuition of language models with rigorous validation of modal logic.

Conclusion: This approach provides a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable autonomous agents by preventing physically or logically untenable conclusions through formal reasoning frameworks.

Abstract: The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language
models (LMs), has shown the critical role in various environments that require
intelligent and autonomous decision. Environments are not passive testing
grounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit
very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous
capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets
has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the
structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these
environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This
paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief
states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This
foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of
\emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal
logic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make
infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for
proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively
guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from
reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity
simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses
complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs
with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world
model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable
autonomous agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel temporal graph-based reasoning framework for multimodal medical diagnosis that uses backtracking and multi-agent validation to improve reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal reasoning models are limited in healthcare applications and fall short in correct diagnostic reasoning, creating a need for better tools to assist healthcare professionals.

Method: Temporal graph-based reasoning process with directed graphs that accommodates dynamic changes through backtracking, refines reasoning content, and uses multi-agent framework with task distribution and cross-validation.

Result: Preliminary experiments and analysis show the approach has novelty and practical utility for tracking patient health and disease progression over time.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses multimodal medical reasoning challenges and shows promise for improving diagnostic accuracy through temporal analysis and validation mechanisms.

Abstract: Healthcare and medicine are multimodal disciplines that deal with multimodal
data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. Although some multimodal
reasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific
domains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall
short in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of
multimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare
professionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through
a directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in
accommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the
reasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the
best recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at
different time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and
disease progression. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent temporal reasoning
framework provides task distributions and a cross-validation mechanism to
further enhance the accuracy of reasoning outputs. A few basic experiments and
analysis results justify the novelty and practical utility of the proposed
preliminary approach.

TL;DR: Decentralized swarm of identical foundation models creates coherent musical compositions through stigmergic coordination without weight updates, outperforming centralized systems in quality, diversity, and structural variety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how coherent long-form creative structures can emerge from decentralized coordination of identical models rather than through centralized control or parameter updates, seeking more compute- and data-efficient approaches to creative generation.

Method: A fully decentralized swarm system where bar-wise agents sense and deposit harmonic, rhythmic, and structural cues, adapt short-term memory, and reach consensus through peer-to-peer stigmergic signals, compared against a centralized multi-agent system with global critic.

Result: The swarm yields superior quality across symbolic, audio, and graph-theoretic analyses, delivering greater diversity and structural variety while leading across creativity metrics. The system contracts toward stable complementary roles and reveals small-world architecture with efficient long-range connectivity.

Conclusion: MusicSwarm demonstrates that shifting specialization from parameter updates to interaction rules, shared memory, and dynamic consensus provides an efficient route to long-horizon creative structure that is transferable beyond music to other collaborative domains.

Abstract: We show that coherent, long-form musical composition can emerge from a
decentralized swarm of identical, frozen foundation models that coordinate via
stigmergic, peer-to-peer signals, without any weight updates. We compare a
centralized multi-agent system with a global critic to a fully decentralized
swarm in which bar-wise agents sense and deposit harmonic, rhythmic, and
structural cues, adapt short-term memory, and reach consensus. Across symbolic,
audio, and graph-theoretic analyses, the swarm yields superior quality while
delivering greater diversity and structural variety and leads across creativity
metrics. The dynamics contract toward a stable configuration of complementary
roles, and self-similarity networks reveal a small-world architecture with
efficient long-range connectivity and specialized bridging motifs, clarifying
how local novelties consolidate into global musical form. By shifting
specialization from parameter updates to interaction rules, shared memory, and
dynamic consensus, MusicSwarm provides a compute- and data-efficient route to
long-horizon creative structure that is immediately transferable beyond music
to collaborative writing, design, and scientific discovery.

TL;DR: MLLMs are vulnerable to implicit reasoning risks where safe unimodal inputs combine to create harmful multimodal outputs. The paper introduces SSUI dataset and SRPO training framework to address this safety alignment issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs struggle with maintaining safety alignment during long-chain reasoning, allowing innocuous inputs to synergistically create harmful outputs through cross-modal interactions.

Method: Created Safe-Semantics-but-Unsafe-Interpretation (SSUI) dataset with interpretable reasoning paths, and developed Safety-aware Reasoning Path Optimization (SRPO) training framework to align MLLM reasoning with human safety values.

Result: SRPO-trained models achieved state-of-the-art results on safety benchmarks including the proposed Reasoning Path Benchmark (RSBench), significantly outperforming both open-source and top-tier commercial MLLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed SSUI dataset and SRPO framework effectively address implicit reasoning risks in MLLMs by optimizing safety alignment throughout the reasoning process, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are susceptible to the implicit
reasoning risk, wherein innocuous unimodal inputs synergistically assemble into
risky multimodal data that produce harmful outputs. We attribute this
vulnerability to the difficulty of MLLMs maintaining safety alignment through
long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce
Safe-Semantics-but-Unsafe-Interpretation (SSUI), the first dataset featuring
interpretable reasoning paths tailored for such a cross-modal challenge. A
novel training framework, Safety-aware Reasoning Path Optimization (SRPO), is
also designed based on the SSUI dataset to align the MLLM's internal reasoning
process with human safety values. Experimental results show that our
SRPO-trained models achieve state-of-the-art results on key safety benchmarks,
including the proposed Reasoning Path Benchmark (RSBench), significantly
outperforming both open-source and top-tier commercial MLLMs.

*Hamied Nabizada,Lasse Beers,Alain Chahine,Felix Gehlhoff,Oliver Niggemann,Alexander Fay*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A model-driven method for automatically generating symbolic planning artifacts (PDDL domain and problem files) from SysML-based engineering models using a dedicated profile, enabling AI planning validation of system variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBSE models lack symbolic planning semantics like preconditions, effects, and constraints, limiting their ability to evaluate system variant performance and task fulfillment efficiency compared to alternatives.

Method: Developed a SysML profile with reusable stereotypes for planning constructs, integrated into existing models, and created an algorithm that automatically generates valid PDDL domain and problem files while maintaining consistency between engineering and planning artifacts.

Result: Successfully demonstrated through an aircraft assembly case study where engineering models were enriched with planning semantics and consistent planning artifacts were generated, enabling system variant validation via AI planning.

Conclusion: The method provides native integration of planning semantics into MBSE environments, overcoming limitations of manual transformations and external capability models, and enables automated generation of planning artifacts for system validation.

Abstract: Engineering models created in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)
environments contain detailed information about system structure and behavior.
However, they typically lack symbolic planning semantics such as preconditions,
effects, and constraints related to resource availability and timing. This
limits their ability to evaluate whether a given system variant can fulfill
specific tasks and how efficiently it performs compared to alternatives.
  To address this gap, this paper presents a model-driven method that enables
the specification and automated generation of symbolic planning artifacts
within SysML-based engineering models. A dedicated SysML profile introduces
reusable stereotypes for core planning constructs. These are integrated into
existing model structures and processed by an algorithm that generates a valid
domain file and a corresponding problem file in Planning Domain Definition
Language (PDDL). In contrast to previous approaches that rely on manual
transformations or external capability models, the method supports native
integration and maintains consistency between engineering and planning
artifacts.
  The applicability of the method is demonstrated through a case study from
aircraft assembly. The example illustrates how existing engineering models are
enriched with planning semantics and how the proposed workflow is applied to
generate consistent planning artifacts from these models. The generated
planning artifacts enable the validation of system variants through AI
planning.

Result: Empirical application revealed significant fairness deficiencies in current LLMs, demonstrating the lack of fair and trustworthy LLM legal tools.

Conclusion: JustEva provides a convenient tool and methodological foundation for evaluating and improving algorithmic fairness in the legal domain, addressing critical concerns about LLM integration in legal practice.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into legal practice raises
pressing concerns about judicial fairness, particularly due to the nature of
their "black-box" processes. This study introduces JustEva, a comprehensive,
open-source evaluation toolkit designed to measure LLM fairness in legal tasks.
JustEva features several advantages: (1) a structured label system covering 65
extra-legal factors; (2) three core fairness metrics - inconsistency, bias, and
imbalanced inaccuracy; (3) robust statistical inference methods; and (4)
informative visualizations. The toolkit supports two types of experiments,
enabling a complete evaluation workflow: (1) generating structured outputs from
LLMs using a provided dataset, and (2) conducting statistical analysis and
inference on LLMs' outputs through regression and other statistical methods.
Empirical application of JustEva reveals significant fairness deficiencies in
current LLMs, highlighting the lack of fair and trustworthy LLM legal tools.
JustEva offers a convenient tool and methodological foundation for evaluating
and improving algorithmic fairness in the legal domain.

### [281] [Co-Alignment: Rethinking Alignment as Bidirectional Human-AI Cognitive Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12179)
*Yubo Li,Weiyi Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bidirectional Cognitive Alignment (BiCA) enables mutual adaptation between humans and AI through learnable protocols and controlled co-evolution, achieving superior collaboration results compared to traditional single-directional alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI alignment methods treat human cognition as fixed while forcing AI to conform to human preferences. This paper proposes a shift to bidirectional co-alignment where both humans and AI mutually adapt to each other.

Method: BiCA uses learnable protocols, representation mapping, and KL-budget constraints to enable controlled co-evolution between humans and AI systems.

Result: In collaborative navigation tasks, BiCA achieved 85.5% success rate (vs 70.3% baseline), 230% better mutual adaptation, 332% better protocol convergence, and 84% improvement over handcrafted protocols. Unexpectedly improved safety with +23% out-of-distribution robustness.

Conclusion: The 46% synergy improvement demonstrates optimal collaboration exists at the intersection of human and AI capabilities, validating the paradigm shift from single-directional to bidirectional co-alignment approaches.

Abstract: Current AI alignment through RLHF follows a single directional paradigm that
AI conforms to human preferences while treating human cognition as fixed. We
propose a shift to co-alignment through Bidirectional Cognitive Alignment
(BiCA), where humans and AI mutually adapt. BiCA uses learnable protocols,
representation mapping, and KL-budget constraints for controlled co-evolution.
In collaborative navigation, BiCA achieved 85.5% success versus 70.3% baseline,
with 230% better mutual adaptation and 332% better protocol convergence.
Emergent protocols outperformed handcrafted ones by 84%, while bidirectional
adaptation unexpectedly improved safety (+23% out-of-distribution robustness).
The 46% synergy improvement demonstrates optimal collaboration exists at the
intersection, not union, of human and AI capabilities, validating the shift
from single-directional to co-alignment paradigms.

TL;DR: LLMs outperform physicians in text-based differential diagnosis and can convincingly emulate expert medical presentations, though image interpretation and literature retrieval remain challenging areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate AI's comprehensive reasoning and presentation skills in medical diagnosis beyond just final diagnosis accuracy, addressing the multifaceted requirements of expert medical discussants.

Method: Created CPC-Bench from 7102 Clinicopathological Conferences and 1021 Image Challenges, conducted physician annotation, evaluated leading LLMs, and developed Dr. CaBot AI discussant for written and slide-based presentations.

Result: OpenAI's o3 ranked first in 60% of cases and top ten in 84% of cases, outperforming 20-physician baseline. CaBot was misclassified as human in 74% of trials and scored more favorably across quality dimensions. Image challenge accuracy was 67%.

Conclusion: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based differential diagnosis and can convincingly emulate expert presentations, but image interpretation and literature retrieval need improvement. CPC-Bench and CaBot enable transparent tracking of medical AI progress.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: For over a century, the New England Journal of Medicine
Clinicopathological Conferences (CPCs) have tested the reasoning of expert
physicians and, recently, artificial intelligence (AI). However, prior AI
evaluations have focused on final diagnoses without addressing the multifaceted
reasoning and presentation skills required of expert discussants.
  METHODS: Using 7102 CPCs (1923-2025) and 1021 Image Challenges (2006-2025),
we conducted extensive physician annotation and automated processing to create
CPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark spanning 10 text-based and
multimodal tasks, against which we evaluated leading large language models
(LLMs). Then, we developed "Dr. CaBot," an AI discussant designed to produce
written and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation,
modeling the role of the human expert in these cases.
  RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the
final diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases,
outperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached
98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per
unit of information. Performance was lower on literature search and image
tasks; o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) achieved 67% accuracy on image
challenges. In blinded comparisons of CaBot vs. human expert-generated text,
physicians misclassified the source of the differential in 46 of 62 (74%) of
trials, and scored CaBot more favorably across quality dimensions. To promote
research, we are releasing CaBot and CPC-Bench.
  CONCLUSIONS: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based
differential diagnosis and convincingly emulate expert medical presentations,
but image interpretation and literature retrieval remain weaker. CPC-Bench and
CaBot may enable transparent and continued tracking of progress in medical AI.
