### [1] [Pathological Truth Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22674)
*Yash Thube*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATS is a behavioral audit that measures VLMs' ability to reject visually contradicted statements, revealing systematic failures in instruction-tuned generative models while contrastive encoders are more robust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard benchmarks can hide systematic failures in Vision Language Models that reduce real-world trust, so a behavioral audit is needed to measure truthfulness in multimodal contexts.

Method: Introduces MATS audit with two metrics (Spatial Consistency Score and Incorrect Agreement Rate), uses activation patching to causally localize failure loci in models.

Result: Instruction-tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) show very low SCS and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust.

Conclusion: Activation patching identifies specific failure locations in models and suggests concrete repair paths for improving multimodal truthfulness.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are improving quickly, but standard benchmarks
can hide systematic failures that reduce real world trust. We introduce MATS
(Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization), a compact behavioral audit that
measures whether models reject visually contradicted statements, and two
metrics Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR).
Instruction tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) exhibit very low SCS
and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust.
Activation patching causally localizes failure loci (mid to late cross
attention for generative models, pooled projection components for contrastive
models) and suggests concrete repair paths.

### [2] [Scale and Rotation Estimation of Similarity-Transformed Images via Cross-Correlation Maximization Based on Auxiliary Function Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22686)
*Shinji Yamashita,Yuma Kinoshita,Hitoshi Kiya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel algorithm for joint scale and rotation estimation in image alignment with sub-pixel precision, combining Fourier transform in log-polar coordinates with cross-correlation maximization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional phase-correlation methods work well for translation but fail to handle scale and rotation changes that occur due to camera zooming or rotational movements, which are common in real-world scenarios.

Method: Integrates scale and rotation estimation using Fourier transform in log-polar coordinates with cross-correlation maximization strategy and auxiliary function method, incorporating sub-pixel-level cross-correlation.

Result: Experimental results show lower mean estimation errors for both scale and rotation compared to conventional Fourier transform-based methods that use discrete cross-correlation.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a highly efficient solution for precise joint estimation of scale and rotation in image alignment, outperforming existing Fourier-based techniques.

Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient algorithm capable of jointly
estimating scale and rotation between two images with sub-pixel precision.
Image alignment serves as a critical process for spatially registering images
captured from different viewpoints, and finds extensive use in domains such as
medical imaging and computer vision. Traditional phase-correlation techniques
are effective in determining translational shifts; however, they are inadequate
when addressing scale and rotation changes, which often arise due to camera
zooming or rotational movements. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
that integrates scale and rotation estimation based on the Fourier transform in
log-polar coordinates with a cross-correlation maximization strategy,
leveraging the auxiliary function method. By incorporating sub-pixel-level
cross-correlation our method enables precise estimation of both scale and
rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
lower mean estimation errors for scale and rotation than conventional Fourier
transform-based techniques that rely on discrete cross-correlation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework using GRPO with curriculum scheduling and difficulty filtering improves MLLMs' localization and robustness in structured perception tasks like autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise localization and robustness, despite excelling in vision-language reasoning.

Method: Augmented GRPO with curriculum-based data scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering to stabilize optimization under sparse, noisy rewards and enable progressive adaptation to complex samples.

Result: Substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness on autonomous driving benchmarks; ablation studies confirm importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum pacing.

Conclusion: Reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula provides a scalable path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language reasoning
but often struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise
localization and robustness. We propose a reinforcement learning framework that
augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with curriculum-based data
scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering. This approach stabilizes
optimization under sparse, noisy rewards and enables progressive adaptation to
complex samples. Evaluations on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum
pacing for convergence stability and generalization. Our findings highlight
reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula as a scalable
path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

### [4] [Graph-Theoretic Consistency for Robust and Topology-Aware Semi-Supervised Histopathology Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22689)
*Ha-Hieu Pham,Minh Le,Han Huynh,Nguyen Quoc Khanh Le,Huy-Hieu Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TGC is a semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework that uses graph-theoretic constraints to enforce global topology and improve segmentation accuracy in computational pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised methods rely on pixel-level consistency, which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks in computational pathology where dense annotations are costly.

Method: Proposes Topology Graph Consistency (TGC) framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between prediction graphs and references.

Result: TGC achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision on GlaS and CRAG datasets, significantly narrowing the gap to full supervision.

Conclusion: The proposed TGC framework effectively enforces global topology constraints and improves segmentation accuracy in semi-supervised settings for computational pathology.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) is vital in computational
pathology, where dense annotations are costly and limited. Existing methods
often rely on pixel-level consistency, which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and
produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks. We propose Topology Graph
Consistency (TGC), a framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by
aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between
prediction graphs and references. This enforces global topology and improves
segmentation accuracy. Experiments on GlaS and CRAG demonstrate that TGC
achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision and significantly
narrows the gap to full supervision. Code is available at

### [5] [A review of Recent Techniques for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22690)
*Andrea Asperti,Salvatore Fiorilla,Simone Nardi,Lorenzo Orsini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey paper reviews both supervised and unsupervised person re-identification methods, highlighting that supervised approaches have little room for improvement while unsupervised methods are rapidly closing the performance gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised person Re-ID requires extensive labeled data which poses scalability challenges, motivating the shift towards unsupervised methods that leverage abundant unlabeled data.

Method: The survey categorizes significant publications in supervised person Re-ID and explores recent advancements in unsupervised methods over the past three years.

Result: Supervised techniques have reached maturity with limited improvement potential, while unsupervised methods show promising developments and narrowing performance gaps.

Conclusion: The survey captures the mature landscape of supervised person Re-ID and the emerging potential of unsupervised learning, contributing to understanding the convergence between these paradigms.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReId), a crucial task in surveillance, involves
matching individuals across different camera views. The advent of Deep
Learning, especially supervised techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks
and Attention Mechanisms, has significantly enhanced person Re-ID. However, the
success of supervised approaches hinges on vast amounts of annotated data,
posing scalability challenges in data labeling and computational costs. To
address these limitations, recent research has shifted towards unsupervised
person re-identification. Leveraging abundant unlabeled data, unsupervised
methods aim to overcome the need for pairwise labelled data. Although
traditionally trailing behind supervised approaches, unsupervised techniques
have shown promising developments in recent years, signalling a narrowing
performance gap. Motivated by this evolving landscape, our survey pursues two
primary objectives. First, we review and categorize significant publications in
supervised person re-identification, providing an in-depth overview of the
current state-of-the-art and emphasizing little room for further improvement in
this domain. Second, we explore the latest advancements in unsupervised person
re-identification over the past three years, offering insights into emerging
trends and shedding light on the potential convergence of performance between
supervised and unsupervised paradigms. This dual-focus survey aims to
contribute to the evolving narrative of person re-identification, capturing
both the mature landscape of supervised techniques and the promising outcomes
in the realm of unsupervised learning.

### [6] [Sequential Token Merging: Revisiting Hidden States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22691)
*Yan Wen,Peng Ye,Lin Zhang,Baopu Li,Jiakang Yuan,Yaoxin Yang,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STM (Sequential Token Merging) reduces token redundancy in Vision Mambas while preserving sequential dependencies, achieving minimal accuracy degradation with significant token reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mambas suffer from quadratic token scaling with image resolution, and existing methods overlook the critical Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) mechanism and Mamba's selective scan for gradual information aggregation.

Method: Proposes Sequential Token Merging (STM) with: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging for symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden states protection to stabilize hidden states around class token, leveraging Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence.

Result: Achieves only 1.0% accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and 1.4% degradation for ViM-S at 40% reduction, providing state-of-the-art efficiency with minimal complexity.

Conclusion: STM successfully converts temporal forgetfulness into stability, offers new insights into state-space model dynamics, and achieves superior token reduction while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Vision Mambas (ViMs) achieve remarkable success with sub-quadratic
complexity, but their efficiency remains constrained by quadratic token scaling
with image resolution. While existing methods address token redundancy, they
overlook ViMs' intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) - a
critical information flow mechanism revealed in our analysis. We further
identify Mamba's selective scan enables gradual information aggregation in
hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose Sequential Token Merging
(STM), featuring: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve
sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden
states protection to stabilize the hidden states around the class token. STM
strategically leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal
forgetfulness into stability. Experiments demonstrate STM's superiority: 1.0%
accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for
ViM-S at 40% reduction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with
minimal complexity, while providing new insights into state-space model
dynamics. Codes will be released soon.

### [7] [Deep Learning Empowered Super-Resolution: A Comprehensive Survey and Future Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22692)

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of super-resolution methods covering SISR, VSR, SSR, and LFSR, analyzing over 250 methods across domains with methodology analysis and taxonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing super-resolution surveys focus on specific domains, lacking a comprehensive overview of the entire field despite significant advances in deep learning techniques and growing demand for high-quality visual applications.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has garnered significant attention within the computer
vision community, driven by advances in deep learning (DL) techniques and the
growing demand for high-quality visual applications. With the expansion of this
field, numerous surveys have emerged. Most existing surveys focus on specific

SISR methods, nearly 70 VSR approaches, and approximately 30 techniques for SSR
and LFSR. We analyze methodologies, datasets, evaluation protocols, empirical
results, and complexity. In addition, we conducted a taxonomy based on each
backbone structure according to the diverse purposes. We also explore valuable
yet under-studied open issues in the field. We believe that this work will

### [8] [Learning Hyperspectral Images with Curated Text Prompts for Efficient Multimodal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22697)
*Abhiroop Chatterjee,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a parameter-efficient CLIP-style contrastive learning framework for aligning hyperspectral images with text descriptions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 0.07% parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images present unique challenges due to their high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, and existing vision-language models are not optimized for this domain. There's a need for efficient cross-modal alignment in hyperspectral scene understanding.

Method: Uses a CLIP-style contrastive training framework where voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone are mapped to a frozen large embedding model's latent space. A trainable probe aligns vision features with textual tokens using contrastive loss with hard and semi-hard negatives, plus descriptive prompts as structured anchors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter updates (0.07%): +0.92 OA and +1.60 Kappa on Indian Pines, +0.69 OA and +0.90 Kappa on Pavia University, using 50-90x fewer parameters than baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables efficient cross-modal alignment for hyperspectral scene understanding with minimal parameter updates, demonstrating superior performance and parameter efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: As data requirements continue to grow, efficient learning increasingly
depends on the curation and distillation of high-value data rather than
brute-force scaling of model sizes. In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI),
the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where
each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral
channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for
natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral
domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an
attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene
understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our
framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent
space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns
vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two
modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of
hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives,
along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts
that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for
the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07
percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For
example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal
and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa
($\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA
and +0.90 $\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters,
nearly 50$\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.

### [9] [Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering Attention Masking for One-Shot Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22700)
*Zhuang Qi,Pan Yu,Lei Meng,Sijin Zhou,Han Yu,Xiaoxiao Li,Xiangxu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPR-NIAM is a one-shot federated prompt learning method that uses attention masking and global prompt refinement to achieve better cross-task generalization without multi-round communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated prompt learning methods require multi-round communication and lack cross-task generalization capabilities, limiting their practical deployment.

Method: Uses attention isolation module to restrict prompt-text interactions and cross-silo collaborative refinement to integrate decentralized knowledge through multi-source cross-modal alignment.

Result: Outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods on ten benchmark datasets in both class-level and domain-level generalization tasks.

Conclusion: GPR-NIAM enables effective one-shot federated prompt learning with strong cross-task generalization by controlling attention interactions and refining global prompts.

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by
tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL
methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the
second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models.
Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully
exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods
typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To
bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering
Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to
design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the
original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves
this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention
isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the
original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves
generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement
module integrates decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and
calibrates the global prompt through multi-source cross-modal knowledge
alignment, further mitigating the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity.
Extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets under two tasks show
that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level
and domain-level generalization.

*Ahed Alboody*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GZSL-MoE integrates Mixture-of-Experts into Generative Zero-Shot Learning for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, improving performance on both seen and unseen classes in HRC environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of 3D semantic segmentation when comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable, particularly in Human-Robot Collaboration environments.

Method: Combines Generative Zero-Shot Learning with Mixture-of-Experts layers to generate realistic fake features of unseen classes, using KPConv for feature extraction on seen classes.

Result: The GZSL-MoE model demonstrates enhanced performance on both seen and unseen classes in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: GZSL-MoE provides a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments when complete training data is unavailable, showing improved generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Generative Zero-Shot Learning approach (GZSL) has demonstrated significant
potential in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. GZSL leverages
generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real
features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes
during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we
introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts
(GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to
generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a
pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main
contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the
Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning
model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset
(CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC)
environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with
Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides
a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when
comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The
performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance
performance on both seen and unseen classes. Keywords Generalized Zero-Shot

### [11] [IBiT: Utilizing Inductive Biases to Create a More Data Efficient Attention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22719)
*Adithya Giri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introducing inductive biases through learned masks enables Vision Transformers to learn effectively on small datasets without Knowledge Distillation, resulting in more accurate models while maintaining explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers lack the inductive biases of CNNs, which limits their performance on small datasets. The goal is to incorporate these biases to improve Vision Transformers' learning on smaller datasets.

Method: Learned masks are used to introduce inductive biases into Vision Transformers, creating Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT).

Result: IBiT models are significantly more accurate on small datasets compared to standard Vision Transformers, while preserving their explainability.

Conclusion: Incorporating inductive biases through learned masks is an effective approach to enhance Vision Transformers' performance on small datasets without sacrificing their explainable nature.

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based architectures have become the dominant
method for Computer Vision applications. While Transformers are explainable and
scale well with dataset size, they lack the inductive biases of Convolutional
Neural Networks. While these biases may be learned on large datasets, we show
that introducing these inductive biases through learned masks allow Vision
Transformers to learn on much smaller datasets without Knowledge Distillation.
These Transformers, which we call Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT),
are significantly more accurate on small datasets, while retaining the
explainability Transformers.

### [12] [LayoutAgent: A Vision-Language Agent Guided Compositional Diffusion for Spatial Layout Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22720)
*Zezhong Fan,Xiaohan Li,Luyi Ma,Kai Zhao,Liang Peng,Topojoy Biswas,Evren Korpeoglu,Kaushiki Nag,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutAgent is an agentic framework that combines vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion to generate realistic multi-object scene layouts that respect semantic relations and physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models lack explicit spatial reasoning, leading to unrealistic object layouts, while traditional spatial planning methods in robotics struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes.

Method: The framework uses visual-language models for input preprocessing (segmentation, object size estimation, scene graph construction, prompt rewriting), then applies compositional diffusion to synthesize bounding boxes respecting object relations, and finally uses a foreground-conditioned image generator to compose the complete scene.

Result: LayoutAgent outperforms state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between high-quality image generation and spatial planning by unifying vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for realistic scene layout generation.

Abstract: Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images,
but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical
plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have
enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning,
leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial
planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency,
but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies
vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation.
Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first
employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation,
object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we
leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to
synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene
graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator
composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout
guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent
outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout
coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

### [13] [CompareBench: A Benchmark for Visual Comparison Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22737)
*Jie Cai,Kangning Yang,Lan Fu,Jiaming Ding,Jinlong Li,Huiming Sun,Daitao Xing,Jinglin Shen,Zibo Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompareBench is a new benchmark for evaluating visual comparison reasoning in VLMs, consisting of 1000 QA pairs across quantity, temporal, geometric, and spatial tasks, revealing systematic limitations in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual comparison reasoning is a fundamental but understudied skill in vision-language models that needs better evaluation methods.

Method: Created CompareBench with 1000 QA pairs across four tasks using auxiliary datasets TallyBench (counting images) and HistCaps (historical images), then evaluated both closed-source and open-source VLMs.

Result: Models show scaling trends but consistently fail at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and make mistakes in basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans.

Conclusion: Visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for current VLMs, and CompareBench provides a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce CompareBench, a benchmark for evaluating visual comparison
reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), a fundamental yet understudied
skill. CompareBench consists of 1000 QA pairs across four tasks: quantity
(600), temporal (100), geometric (200), and spatial (100). It is derived from
two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images
with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We
evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source
models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but
also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail
at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in
basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans. These
findings demonstrate that visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for
current VLMs. By providing controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation,
CompareBench establishes a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal
reasoning.

### [14] [MILR: Improving Multimodal Image Generation via Test-Time Latent Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22761)
*Yapeng Mi,Hengli Li,Yanpeng Zhao,Chenxi Li,Huimin Wu,Xiaojian Ma,Song-Chun Zhu,Ying Nian Wu,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILR is a test-time reasoning method that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent space, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning-based image generation methods are limited to single modalities or require high-quality reasoning data for fine-tuning, which restricts their performance and applicability.

Method: MILR performs joint reasoning in a unified latent vector space by searching through discrete image and text tokens using policy gradient method guided by an image quality critic, implemented within the MUG framework.

Result: MILR achieves state-of-the-art results on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE benchmarks, with an 80% improvement over baseline on knowledge-intensive WISE (overall score 0.63).

Conclusion: Joint reasoning in unified latent space is key to MILR's strong performance, and the method demonstrates non-trivial abilities in temporal and cultural reasoning.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance
in various domains, including image generation. However, existing
reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a
single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for
fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method
that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space.
Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of
discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy
gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within
the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that
natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus
facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to
be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate
entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE,
achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on
knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over
the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the
unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our
qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural
reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.

TL;DR: UESA-Net is a U-shaped network with multidirectional shrinkage attention that achieves state-of-the-art performance in breast and thyroid ultrasound segmentation by bridging global context with local details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges in ultrasound imaging including speckle noise, overlapping structures, and weak global-local feature interactions that existing networks struggle with, particularly the semantic gap between high-level semantics and low-level spatial details.

Method: Proposed UESA-Net with encoder-decoder architecture using multidirectional shrinkage attention modules operating along horizontal, vertical, and depth directions, with shrinkage strategies to integrate prior knowledge and local features.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) datasets with IoU scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495 respectively.

Conclusion: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Background: Breast and thyroid cancers pose an increasing public-health
burden. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time modality for lesion
detection and segmentation, yet suffers from speckle noise, overlapping
structures, and weak global-local feature interactions. Existing networks
struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details. We
aim to develop a segmentation framework that bridges the semantic gap between
global context and local detail in noisy ultrasound images.
  Methods: We propose UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional
shrinkage attention. The encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range
dependencies and fine-grained structures of lesions. Within each encoding
block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth
directions to exploit spatial details, while a shrinkage (threshold) strategy
integrates prior knowledge and local features. The decoder mirrors the encoder
but applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism, combining prior low-level physical
cues with corresponding encoder features to enhance context modeling.
  Results: On two public datasets - TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) -
UESA-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with intersection-over-union
(IoU) scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively.
  Conclusions: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial
information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast
and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to
existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartCo is a novel framework that enhances Generalized Category Discovery by incorporating part-level visual feature correspondences to better distinguish closely related categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods rely on semantic labels and global image representations, overlooking detailed part-level cues that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories.

Method: PartCo leverages part-level relationships and visual feature correspondences to capture finer-grained semantic structures, integrating seamlessly with existing GCD methods.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show PartCo significantly improves GCD performance and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: PartCo bridges the gap between semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, setting new benchmarks for Generalized Category Discovery.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and novel
categories within unlabeled data by leveraging a set of labeled examples from
known categories. Existing GCD methods primarily depend on semantic labels and
global image representations, often overlooking the detailed part-level cues
that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories. In this paper,
we introduce PartCo, short for Part-Level Correspondence Prior, a novel
framework that enhances category discovery by incorporating part-level visual
feature correspondences. By leveraging part-level relationships, PartCo
captures finer-grained semantic structures, enabling a more nuanced
understanding of category relationships. Importantly, PartCo seamlessly
integrates with existing GCD methods without requiring significant
modifications. Our extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that PartCo significantly improves the performance of current GCD
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results by bridging the gap between
semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, thereby setting new
benchmarks for GCD. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/partco

*Komal Kumar,Rao Muhammad Anwer,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Salman Khan,Ivan Laptev,Hisham Cholakkal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEFT is an efficient fine-tuning framework for text-to-image models that decomposes weight updates into two low-rank components, enabling better trade-offs between personalization, multi-task unification, and editability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current efficient fine-tuning methods struggle to balance learning new concepts from limited data while maintaining instruction-following ability across multiple tasks and preserving editability with various prompts.

Method: Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning (DEFT) adapts pre-trained weights by decomposing updates into: (1) projection onto complement of low-rank subspace, and (2) low-rank update within that subspace using two trainable matrices.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on Dreambooth, Dreambench Plus (personalization), InsDet (object/scene adaptation), and VisualCloze (universal generation) datasets with both Stable Diffusion and unified models.

Conclusion: DEFT demonstrates emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning, achieving superior performance in balancing personalization, multi-task capability, and editability while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) models involves
adjusting the model to suit a particular task or dataset while minimizing
computational resources and limiting the number of trainable parameters.
However, it often faces challenges in striking a trade-off between aligning
with the target distribution: learning a novel concept from a limited image for
personalization and retaining the instruction ability needed for unifying
multiple tasks, all while maintaining editability (aligning with a variety of
prompts or in-context generation). In this work, we introduce DEFT,
Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning framework that
adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by decomposing its update into two
components with two trainable matrices: (1) a projection onto the complement of
a low-rank subspace spanned by a low-rank matrix, and (2) a low-rank update.
The single trainable low-rank matrix defines the subspace, while the other
trainable low-rank matrix enables flexible parameter adaptation within that
subspace. We conducted extensive experiments on the Dreambooth and Dreambench
Plus datasets for personalization, the InsDet dataset for object and scene
adaptation, and the VisualCloze dataset for a universal image generation
framework through visual in-context learning with both Stable Diffusion and a
unified model. Our results demonstrated state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting the emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning. Our code is

TL;DR: VideoScore2 is a multi-dimensional, interpretable video evaluation framework that assesses visual quality, text-video alignment, and physical consistency with detailed rationales, outperforming existing methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video evaluators provide only single opaque scores or coarse analysis, lacking interpretability and comprehensive assessment of video quality across multiple dimensions.

Method: Two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on VideoFeedback2 dataset (27,168 human-annotated videos) followed by reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance analytical robustness.

Result: Achieves 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance across four out-of-domain benchmarks, providing interpretable assessments for controllable generation via reward modeling.

Conclusion: VideoScore2 bridges the gap between evaluation and controllable generation through effective multi-dimensional assessment with detailed reasoning, enabling better video quality evaluation and generation control.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly
realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental
challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality,
semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward
models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide
only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive
nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a
multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly
evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense
consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is
trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168
human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three
dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our
in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance
across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc),

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSMs like VMamba show promise as efficient alternatives to Vision Transformers, but their performance degrades significantly under distribution shifts, requiring adaptation methods.

Method: TRUST generates multiple causal perspectives of input images through diverse traversal permutations, uses model predictions as pseudo-labels to update Mamba-specific parameters, and averages adapted weights across traversal scans.

Result: Experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that TRUST consistently improves robustness and outperforms existing test-time adaptation methods.

Conclusion: TRUST is the first approach that explicitly leverages SSMs' unique architectural properties for adaptation, effectively addressing distribution shift challenges.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with VMamba standing out as a pioneering architecture
designed for vision tasks. However, their generalization performance degrades
significantly under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we propose
TRUST (Test-Time Refinement using Uncertainty-Guided SSM Traverses), a novel
test-time adaptation (TTA) method that leverages diverse traversal permutations
to generate multiple causal perspectives of the input image. Model predictions
serve as pseudo-labels to guide updates of the Mamba-specific parameters, and
the adapted weights are averaged to integrate the learned information across
traversal scans. Altogether, TRUST is the first approach that explicitly
leverages the unique architectural properties of SSMs for adaptation.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that TRUST consistently improves
robustness and outperforms existing TTA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMPB is the first extensive benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on personalization, comprising 10k image-query pairs across 111 concepts in four categories, revealing that most VLMs struggle with personalization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual personalization is crucial for user-facing AI systems like smart homes and healthcare, but current VLMs remain underexplored in adapting to individual users, highlighting the need for systematic evaluation.

Method: Created MMPB benchmark with 10k image-query pairs across 111 concepts in humans, animals, objects, and characters. Evaluated 23 VLMs using three-stage protocol: concept injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying across three task types.

Result: Most VLMs (including closed-source models) struggle with personalization, particularly in maintaining dialogue consistency, handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Identified challenges like refusal behaviors and long-context forgetting.

Conclusion: MMPB reveals substantial room for improvement in VLM personalization capabilities and provides a scalable benchmark foundation for future research toward truly personalized multi-modal AI systems.

Abstract: Visual personalization is essential in user-facing AI systems such as smart
homes and healthcare, where aligning model behavior with user-centric concepts
is critical. However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their
broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to
individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive
benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k
image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four
categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category
enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into
three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs.
Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we
evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept
injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings
indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with
personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue,
handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals
that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and
long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By
identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers
valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly
personalized multi-modal AI. Project Page: aidaslab.github.io/MMPB

*Roie Kazoom,Alon Goldberg,Hodaya Cohen,Ofer Hadar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for fully controllable adversarial patch generation that allows attackers to choose both input image and target class, achieving state-of-the-art performance with attack success rates consistently exceeding 99% while maintaining visual realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing adversarial patch approaches rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world applicability.

Method: Combines a generative U-Net design with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement for semantic-aware localization that maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism.

Result: Achieves attack success rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99% across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16).

Conclusion: The framework establishes a new benchmark for adversarial robustness research by simultaneously ensuring realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability - the three most challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks, yet
most existing approaches rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted
objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully
controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose
both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the
exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design
with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that
maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive
experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision
transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success
rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%.
  Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box
attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic
approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring
realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most
challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new
benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between
theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.

TL;DR: CrossScaleNet is a novel architecture combining patch-based cross-attention with multi-scale processing for time series forecasting, providing both high performance and enhanced temporal explainability without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are computationally expensive and complex, while existing explainable models often fail to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks.

Method: Uses patch-based cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing, embedding attention mechanisms directly into training to provide intrinsic explainability for temporal saliency.

Result: Outperforms most transformer-based models on real-world forecasting tasks, demonstrates robustness in identifying temporal saliency on synthetic datasets with known ground truth, and maintains superior performance in both saliency detection and forecasting accuracy.

Conclusion: CrossScaleNet effectively bridges the gap between explainability and performance, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across datasets of varying complexity.

Abstract: Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model
transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present
CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based
cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high
performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention
mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic
explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more
transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are
computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance
detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer
features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its
complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency
ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness
of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world
datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms
most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without
sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior
performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy.
Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail
to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses
this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency
effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across
datasets of varying complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transfer learning-based method using multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA and slice interaction module (SIM) improves internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) segmentation in lung cancer PET/CT imaging, achieving significant performance gains over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and accurate IGTV delineation in PET/CT imaging is crucial for radiation therapy planning. However, this is challenging due to limited annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor boundaries.

Method: Transfer learning approach using multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained on extensive GTV datasets and fine-tuned on private IGTV cohort from LUCID dataset. Introduces slice interaction module (SIM) with channel and spatial attention branches in a 2.5D segmentation framework to model inter-slice relationships.

Result: Achieves Dice score of 0.609 on private IGTV dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385, demonstrating significant improvement in segmentation performance.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of transfer learning combined with advanced multimodal techniques and SIM to enhance IGTV segmentation reliability and clinical relevance for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths globally.
Accurate delineation of internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) in PET/CT imaging is
pivotal for optimal radiation therapy in mobile tumors such as lung cancer to
account for tumor motion, yet is hindered by the limited availability of
annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor
boundaries. In this study, we present a transfer learningbased methodology
utilizing a multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained
on extensive gross tumor volume (GTV) datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on a
private IGTV cohort. This cohort constitutes the PET/CT subset of the
Lung-cancer Unified Cross-modal Imaging Dataset (LUCID). To further address the
challenge of weak PET intensities in IGTV peripheral slices, we introduce a
slice interaction module (SIM) within a 2.5D segmentation framework to
effectively model inter-slice relationships. Our proposed module integrates
channel and spatial attention branches with depthwise convolutions, enabling
more robust learning of slice-to-slice dependencies and thereby improving
overall segmentation performance. A comprehensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates that our approach achieves a Dice of 0.609 on the private IGTV
dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385.
This work highlights the potential of transfer learning, coupled with advanced
multimodal techniques and a SIM to enhance the reliability and clinical
relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

Conclusion: The approach effectively reduces the cost of producing labeled event datasets and demonstrates powerful text-based generation capabilities inherited from foundation models.

Abstract: In recent years, event cameras have gained significant attention due to their

ControlEvents, a diffusion-based generative model designed to synthesize

diffusion prior from foundation models, such as Stable Diffusion, enabling
high-quality event data generation with minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled
data. Our method streamlines the data generation process and significantly
reduces the cost of producing labeled event datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by synthesizing event data for visual
recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation. Our

TL;DR: KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration using implicit neural representations, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy among INR-based methods with reduced computational costs and improved learning stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based DIR methods require large datasets and struggle with precision on some organs and modalities, while implicit neural representations offer an alternative but suffer from computational inefficiency and seed-dependent instability.

Method: Proposed KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with implicit neural representations, featuring a randomized basis sampling strategy to reduce basis functions while maintaining registration quality.

Result: Achieved highest accuracy among INR-based methods across lung CT, brain MRI, and cardiac MRI datasets, with minimal computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random seeds.

Conclusion: RandKAN-IDIR with randomized basis sampling slightly outperforms learnable basis function indices while eliminating additional training complexity, making it an efficient and stable solution for deformable image registration.

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cornerstone of medical image
analysis, enabling spatial alignment for tasks like comparative studies and
multi-modal fusion. While learning-based methods (e.g., CNNs, transformers)
offer fast inference, they often require large training datasets and struggle
to match the precision of classical iterative approaches on some organ types
and imaging modalities. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as
a promising alternative, parameterizing deformations as continuous mappings
from coordinates to displacement vectors. However, this comes at the cost of
requiring instance-specific optimization, making computational efficiency and
seed-dependent learning stability critical factors for these methods. In this
work, we propose KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR, the first integration of
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration with
implicit neural representations (INRs). Our proposed randomized basis sampling
strategy reduces the required number of basis functions in KAN while
maintaining registration quality, thereby significantly lowering computational
costs. We evaluated our approach on three diverse datasets (lung CT, brain MRI,
cardiac MRI) and compared it with competing instance-specific learning-based
approaches, dataset-trained deep learning models, and classical registration
approaches. KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR achieved the highest accuracy among
INR-based methods across all evaluated modalities and anatomies, with minimal
computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random
seeds. Additionally, we discovered that our RandKAN-IDIR model with randomized
basis sampling slightly outperforms the model with learnable basis function
indices, while eliminating its additional training-time complexity.

*Federico Chinello,Giacomo Boracchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Convolutional Set Transformer (CST) is a neural architecture that directly processes image sets of varying sizes, combining feature extraction and contextual modeling for superior performance in set-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing set-input networks like Deep Sets and Set Transformer can only handle vector inputs, requiring cascading with CNN feature extractors, which prevents simultaneous feature extraction and inter-image relationship modeling.

Method: CST operates directly on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling simultaneously through a novel architecture that combines convolutional processing with set transformer capabilities.

Result: CST achieves superior performance in Set Classification and Set Anomaly Detection tasks, provides native compatibility with CNN explainability methods like Grad-CAM, and can be pre-trained on large datasets for transfer learning.

Conclusion: CST offers an effective solution for processing visually heterogeneous image sets with shared semantics, enabling better performance, explainability, and transfer learning capabilities compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural
architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are
visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common
category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and
Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D
image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor,
typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input
network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly
on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling
simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This
design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set
Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN
explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that
remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale
datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard
Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a
CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet
(https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).

Conclusion: TY-RIST effectively addresses key challenges in infrared small target detection through architectural optimizations, achieving superior accuracy, real-time performance, and strong generalization while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for defense and
surveillance but remains challenging due to (1) target loss from minimal

from low saliency, and (4) high computational costs. To address these issues,
we propose TY-RIST, an optimized YOLOv12n architecture that integrates (1) a
stride-aware backbone with fine-grained receptive fields, (2) a high-resolution

pruning strategy that reduces computational cost by about 25.5% while
marginally improving accuracy and enabling real-time inference. We also
incorporate the Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance (NWD) to enhance
regression stability. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and across 20
different models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, improving mAP at 0.5
IoU by +7.9%, Precision by +3%, and Recall by +10.2%, while achieving up to 123

*Yuelin Xin,Yuheng Liu,Xiaohui Xie,Xinke Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel embedding representation for 3D Gaussian Splatting that addresses the limitations of raw Gaussian parameters in neural network learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raw Gaussian parameters from 3DGS are hard to learn as features due to their non-unique and heterogeneous nature, leading to data-dependent models that don't generalize well.

Method: The authors develop an embedding representation based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, preserving color and geometric structure while enforcing unique mapping and channel homogeneity.

Result: The proposed representation enables more effective learning of 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural network frameworks.

Conclusion: The embedding representation provides a principled approach to represent 3DGS in neural networks, overcoming the limitations of raw parameter-based representations.

Abstract: A well-designed vectorized representation is crucial for the learning systems
natively based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. While 3DGS enables efficient and
explicit 3D reconstruction, its parameter-based representation remains hard to
learn as features, especially for neural-network-based models. Directly feeding
raw Gaussian parameters into learning frameworks fails to address the
non-unique and heterogeneous nature of the Gaussian parameterization, yielding
highly data-dependent models. This challenge motivates us to explore a more
principled approach to represent 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks that
preserves the underlying color and geometric structure while enforcing unique
mapping and channel homogeneity. In this paper, we propose an embedding
representation of 3DGS based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate
the intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, thereby benefiting the

*Yuanzhi Zhu,Xi Wang,Stéphane Lathuilière,Vicky Kalogeiton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Soft-Di[M]O introduces soft embeddings to make one-step generators from Masked Diffusion Models fully differentiable, enabling post-distillation refinements like adversarial training and reward fine-tuning while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-step generators distilled from MDMs have limitations: they inherit modeling bias from teachers and their discrete token outputs block gradient flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training, reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization.

Method: Introduces soft embeddings that replace discrete tokens with expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution, creating a fully differentiable continuous surrogate compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrated into Di[M]O distillation framework as Soft-Di[M]O.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image performance, one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement, higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO across multiple MDM teachers.

Conclusion: Soft embeddings enable end-to-end trainable one-step generators that support various post-distillation refinements while maintaining representation fidelity, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: One-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) compress
multiple sampling steps into a single forward pass, enabling efficient text and
image synthesis. However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit
modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient
flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training,
reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this
work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete
tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution.
Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete
generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is
compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft
embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes
one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward
application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and
TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen),
Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image
performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement,
along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward
fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.

*Chenghan Yang,Peng Zhou,Dong-Sheng Zhang,Yueyun Wang,Hong-Bin Shen,Xiaoyong Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FishAI 2.0 is an intelligent marine fish recognition framework that integrates multimodal few-shot deep learning with image generation for data augmentation, achieving high accuracy in marine fish identification across family, genus, and species levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges with incomplete datasets and unsatisfactory model accuracy, especially for rare species with few-shot conditions where data scarcity significantly hampers performance.

Method: Uses hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, employs DeepSeek LLM to generate textual descriptions, inputs them into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation via hierarchical diffusion strategy, and uses CLIP-based model for few-shot image recognition.

Result: Achieves Top-1 accuracy of 91.67% and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97% at family level, 87.58% at genus level, and 85.42% at species level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models, especially for minority classes with fewer than 10 training samples.

Conclusion: FishAI 2.0 improves efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification, provides scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and conservation, demonstrating scientific value and practical applicability.

Abstract: Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges of
incomplete datasets and unsatisfactory model accuracy, particularly for
few-shot conditions of rare species where data scarcity significantly hampers
the performance. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent
marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot
deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a
hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data
foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0
model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model
DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are
input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical
diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal
feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust
few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0
achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent
at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a
substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training
samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and
species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58
percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI
2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and
provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and
conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.

TL;DR: Proposes an automatic deep-learning framework for brain tumor detection from MRI scans using ResNet50 with novel Dense-Dropout sequence and introduces a new balanced dataset (MMCBT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely detection of brain tumors is critical for patient outcomes, and there's a lack of reliable brain tumor MRI resources for research.

Method: Uses pre-trained ResNet50 for feature extraction, Global Average Pooling, linear projection, and a novel Dense-Dropout sequence to enhance feature learning and reduce overfitting.

Result: Created the MMCBT dataset with 209 subjects (3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images) and addressed class imbalance through augmentation.

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient automated solution for brain tumor detection with improved robustness and addresses dataset limitations in the field.

Abstract: Brain tumors are abnormal cell growths in the central nervous system (CNS),
and their timely detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This
paper proposes an automatic and efficient deep-learning framework for brain
tumor detection from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The framework
employs a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction, followed by Global
Average Pooling (GAP) and linear projection to obtain compact, high-level image
representations. These features are then processed by a novel Dense-Dropout
sequence, a core contribution of this work, which enhances non-linear feature
learning, reduces overfitting, and improves robustness through diverse feature
transformations. Another major contribution is the creation of the Mymensingh
Medical College Brain Tumor (MMCBT) dataset, designed to address the lack of
reliable brain tumor MRI resources. The dataset comprises MRI scans from 209
subjects (ages 9 to 65), including 3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images, all
clinically verified under expert supervision. To overcome class imbalance, the
tumor class was augmented, resulting in a balanced dataset well-suited for deep
learning research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hemorica is a publicly available dataset of 372 head CT scans with comprehensive annotations for five intracranial hemorrhage subtypes, enabling robust AI model development for ICH detection and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented public data problem hindering development of robust AI solutions for timely intracranial hemorrhage diagnosis on CT scans.

Method: Created Hemorica dataset with 372 head CT exams (2012-2024) annotated for five ICH subtypes using double-reading workflow with neurosurgeon adjudication. Established baselines using fine-tuned convolutional and transformer architectures for classification and segmentation tasks.

Result: Lightweight models achieved 87.8% F1 score for binary classification and 85.5% Dice score for lesion segmentation, validating annotation quality and sufficient sample size.

Conclusion: Hemorica provides a unified benchmark supporting multi-task learning, transfer to weakly labeled cohorts, and facilitates AI assistant development for ICH detection and quantification.

Abstract: Timely diagnosis of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on Computed Tomography (CT)
scans remains a clinical priority, yet the development of robust Artificial
Intelligence (AI) solutions is still hindered by fragmented public data. To
close this gap, we introduce Hemorica, a publicly available collection of 372
head CT examinations acquired between 2012 and 2024. Each scan has been
exhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes-epidural (EPH), subdural (SDH),
subarachnoid (SAH), intraparenchymal (IPH), and intraventricular (IVH)-yielding
patient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding
boxes, two-dimensional pixel masks and three-dimensional voxel masks. A
double-reading workflow, preceded by a pilot consensus phase and supported by
neurosurgeon adjudication, maintained low inter-rater variability.
Comprehensive statistical analysis confirms the clinical realism of the
dataset. To establish reference baselines, standard convolutional and
transformer architectures were fine-tuned for binary slice classification and
hemorrhage segmentation. With only minimal fine-tuning, lightweight models such
as MobileViT-XS achieved an F1 score of 87.8% in binary classification, whereas
a U-Net with a DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for binary
lesion segmentation that validate both the quality of the annotations and the
sufficiency of the sample size. Hemorica therefore offers a unified,
fine-grained benchmark that supports multi-task and curriculum learning,
facilitates transfer to larger but weakly labelled cohorts, and facilitates the
process of designing an AI-based assistant for ICH detection and quantification
systems.

*Wenbin Teng,Gonglin Chen,Haiwei Chen,Yajie Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARSS is an autoregressive framework for novel view generation from single images using GPT-style decoder-only models, outperforming diffusion models in consistency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have limitations in world modeling tasks like novel view generation due to non-causal generation causing distortions and inconsistencies across views, while autoregressive models offer causal generation that better handles incremental adaptation.

Method: Uses GPT-style decoder-only AR model with video tokenizer for image sequences, camera encoder for 3D positional guidance, and autoregressive transformer with spatial permutation while maintaining temporal order.

Result: Extensive experiments show ARSS performs comparably to or better than state-of-the-art diffusion-based view synthesis approaches on public datasets.

Conclusion: ARSS demonstrates that autoregressive models can effectively handle novel view generation tasks while maintaining consistency across views, offering a promising alternative to diffusion models for world modeling applications.

Abstract: Despite their exceptional generative quality, diffusion models have limited
applicability to world modeling tasks, such as novel view generation from
sparse inputs. This limitation arises because diffusion models generate outputs
in a non-causal manner, often leading to distortions or inconsistencies across
views, and making it difficult to incrementally adapt accumulated knowledge to
new queries. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal
fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In
this work, we introduce \textbf{ARSS}, a novel framework that leverages a
GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image,
conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ a video tokenizer to
map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera
encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to
enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we
propose a autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial
order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method
performs comparably to, or better than, state-of-the-art view synthesis
approaches based on diffusion models. Our code will be released upon paper
acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to reduce static bias in action recognition by separating temporal dynamic information from static scene information using statistical independence loss and scene prediction loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Action recognition models rely excessively on static cues rather than dynamic human motion (static bias), which leads to poor performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition.

Method: Separates temporal dynamic information from static scene information using a statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined with a scene prediction loss.

Result: The method effectively reduces static bias and experiments confirm the importance of scene prediction loss.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully mitigates static bias in action recognition models through temporal-spatial separation and scene prediction mechanisms.

Abstract: Action recognition models rely excessively on static cues rather than dynamic
human motion, which is known as static bias. This bias leads to poor
performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition. In
this paper, we propose a method to reduce static bias by separating temporal
dynamic information from static scene information. Our approach uses a
statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined
with a scene prediction loss. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
effectively reduces static bias and confirm the importance of scene prediction
loss.

### [35] [Desensitizing for Improving Corruption Robustness in Point Cloud Classification through Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23010)
*Zhiqiang Tian,Weigang Li,Chunhua Deng,Junwei Hu,Yongqiang Wang,Wenping Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Desensitized Adversarial Training (DesenAT) to address DNNs' over-reliance on point cloud features, which makes them vulnerable to corrupted data. The method uses feature desensitization and self-distillation to improve model robustness while maintaining clean data performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud corruption is inevitable due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision. DNNs' over-reliance on input features makes them vulnerable, and it's unclear whether this issue exists in 3D tasks and whether reducing feature dependence can enhance robustness to corrupted point clouds.

Method: Proposed Desensitized Adversarial Training (DesenAT): 1) Quantified DNN sensitivity to point cloud features using Shapley values; 2) Generated adversarial samples by eliminating high-contribution data points and using spatial transformation to simulate corruption; 3) Used self-distillation framework to transfer knowledge from clean samples to adversarial samples and perform adversarial training in a distillation manner.

Result: Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves model robustness to corrupted point clouds without reducing performance on clean datasets.

Conclusion: The DesenAT method successfully alleviates DNNs' over-reliance on point cloud features by smoothing sensitivity through feature desensitization and self-distillation, enhancing robustness to corrupted data while maintaining clean data performance.

Abstract: Due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision,
point cloud corruption is inevitable. Over-reliance on input features is the
root cause of DNN vulnerabilities. It remains unclear whether this issue exists
in 3D tasks involving point clouds and whether reducing dependence on these
features can enhance the model's robustness to corrupted point clouds. This
study attempts to answer these questions. Specifically, we quantified the
sensitivity of the DNN to point cloud features using Shapley values and found
that models trained using traditional methods exhibited high sensitivity values
for certain features. Furthermore, under an equal pruning ratio, prioritizing
the pruning of highly sensitive features causes more severe damage to model
performance than random pruning. We propose `Desensitized Adversarial Training'
(DesenAT), generating adversarial samples using feature desensitization and
conducting training within a self-distillation framework, which aims to
alleviate DNN's over-reliance on point clouds features by smoothing
sensitivity. First, data points with high contribution components are
eliminated, and spatial transformation is used to simulate corruption scenes,
generate adversarial samples, and conduct adversarial training on the model.
Next, to compensate for information loss in adversarial samples, we use the
self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from clean samples to
adversarial samples, and perform adversarial training in a distillation
manner.Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate show
that the propose method can effectively improve the robustness of the model
without reducing the performance of clean data sets. This code is publicly

*Zetian Wu,Tianshuo Zhou,Stefan Lee,Liang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel sign language translation method that incorporates anatomical constraints on skeletal joints to generate more natural and biomechanically plausible body movements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of generating accurate and natural body poses in sign language translation, as prior methods often produce rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs by neglecting anatomical constraints.

Method: Explicitly models relationships among skeletal joints by incorporating geometric constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. Uses parent-relative reweighting for finger flexibility, bone-pose losses, and bone-length constraints for anatomical consistency.

Result: Reduces performance gap between previous best and ground-truth by 56.51%, decreases bone length discrepancies by 18.76%, and reduces movement variance discrepancies by 5.48%.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves anatomical realism and motion naturalness in sign language translation through explicit modeling of skeletal constraints.

Abstract: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling
effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major
challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that
faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical
constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in
rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal
joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric
constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During
training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance
finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses
and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our
method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the
ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length
and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating
significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-Plan is a planning framework using unified multimodal models that enables reasoning through generated visual content, improving decision-making capabilities compared to vision-language model methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most current approaches rely solely on language-based reasoning for decision-making, limiting their ability to reason and make informed decisions. Unified multimodal models that support both multimodal inputs and outputs have greater potential for decision-making.

Method: Built on unified multimodal models where a single model serves as policy, dynamics model, and value function. Uses self-discriminated filtering to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions by having the generative model serve as a self-discriminator.

Result: Substantially improves success rates on long-horizon planning tasks compared to VLM-based methods. Shows strong data scalability, requires no expert demonstrations, and achieves better performance under the same training-data size.

Conclusion: This work lays a foundation for future research in reasoning and decision-making with unified multimodal models.

Abstract: With the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), many recent works have explored using them for
decision-making. However, most of these approaches rely solely on
language-based reasoning, which limits their ability to reason and make
informed decisions. Recently, a promising new direction has emerged with
unified multimodal models (UMMs), which support both multimodal inputs and
outputs. We believe such models have greater potential for decision-making by
enabling reasoning through generated visual content. To this end, we propose
Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs. Within this framework, a single
model simultaneously serves as the policy, dynamics model, and value function.
In addition, to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions, we present a
novel approach self-discriminated filtering, where the generative model serves
as a self-discriminator to filter out invalid dynamics predictions. Experiments
on long-horizon planning tasks show that Uni-Plan substantially improves
success rates compared to VLM-based methods, while also showing strong data
scalability, requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better
performance under the same training-data size. This work lays a foundation for
future research in reasoning and decision-making with UMMs.

*Xiafeng Man,Zhipeng Wei,Jingjing Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel framework for detecting copyright infringement in text-to-image diffusion models using differential privacy principles and conditional sensitivity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision models like Stable Diffusion can memorize and reproduce copyrighted content without authorization, raising legal and ethical concerns. Existing detection methods lack robustness and theoretical foundations.

Method: DPM simulates inclusion/exclusion processes by fine-tuning models in opposing directions (learning/unlearning), computes confidence scores over orthogonal prompt distributions using statistical metrics, and uses conditional sensitivity to quantify output deviations from specific training data.

Result: DPM reliably detects infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset or text prompts, and the authors created the Copyright Infringement Detection Dataset (CIDD) for standardized benchmarking.

Conclusion: DPM offers an interpretable and practical solution for safeguarding intellectual property in generative AI, addressing copyright infringement detection with rigorous theoretical underpinnings.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion
raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and
reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection
approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical
underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright
infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy
(DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to
sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output
caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To
operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc
detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image
diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes
by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning.
Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter
shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal
prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate
standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement
Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection
across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects
infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset
or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for
safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.

*Gabriel A. Viana,Luis F. Alves Pereira,Tsang Ing Ren,George D. C. Cavalcanti,Jan Sijbers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces perceptual influence as a metric to evaluate perceptual loss design choices for LDCT denoising, showing that better loss designs significantly improve noise reduction and structural fidelity without changing network architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perceptual losses are effective for LDCT enhancement but involve underexplored design decisions like feature representation level, pretraining dataset, and loss weighting. Current widely used configurations underperform compared to better alternatives.

Method: Proposed a principled framework using perceptual influence metric to assess perceptual loss design impact. Conducted systematic experimentation to evaluate different configurations including feature levels, pretraining datasets, and loss weighting.

Result: Better-designed perceptual losses significantly improve noise reduction and structural fidelity in reconstructed CT images compared to widely used configurations. The improvements are achieved without any changes to the network architecture.

Conclusion: Provides objective guidelines for effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising, supported by statistical analysis. Better loss design choices lead to substantial performance improvements in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to
enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to
traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to
over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT
images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a
pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level
features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses
involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature
representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the
relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.
In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that
quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total
loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss
design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic
experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature
to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed
alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to
significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of
reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network
architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical
analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

### [40] [Sensor-Adaptive Flood Mapping with Pre-trained Multi-Modal Transformers across SAR and Multispectral Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23035)
*Tomohiro Tanaka,Narumasa Tsutsumida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight multi-modal transformer model (Presto) is proposed for flexible flood detection using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined sensor data, achieving superior performance with only 0.4M parameters while maintaining robustness across different sensor availability scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current flood monitoring methods face operational challenges: single-sensor approaches are weather-dependent with limited revisit periods, while multi-sensor fusion requires heavy computational resources and large labeled datasets. There's a critical need for rapid flood mapping with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters.

Method: Fine-tuned Presto, a lightweight multi-modal pre-trained transformer (∼0.4M parameters) that processes both SAR and multispectral data at pixel level. The approach enables flood mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single model architecture.

Result: Achieved F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in optimal sensor-fusion scenario, outperforming Prithvi-100M baseline. Maintained effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1: 0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1: 0.718).

Conclusion: The parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios, confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational flood mapping regardless of sensor availability constraints.

Abstract: Floods are increasingly frequent natural disasters causing extensive human
and economic damage, highlighting the critical need for rapid and accurate
flood inundation mapping. While remote sensing technologies have advanced flood
monitoring capabilities, operational challenges persist: single-sensor
approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit
periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require substantial computational
resources and large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, this
study introduces a novel sensor-flexible flood detection methodology by
fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight ($\sim$0.4M parameters) multi-modal
pre-trained transformer that processes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and
multispectral (MS) data at the pixel level. Our approach uniquely enables flood
mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single
model architecture, addressing the critical operational need for rapid response
with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters. We
evaluated our method on the Sen1Floods11 dataset against the large-scale
Prithvi-100M baseline ($\sim$100M parameters) across three realistic data
availability scenarios. The proposed model achieved superior performance with
an F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in the optimal sensor-fusion scenario,
outperforming the established baseline. Crucially, the model demonstrated
robustness by maintaining effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1:
0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1:
0.718), confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational
flood mapping. Our parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an
accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring
immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability
constraints.

*Jingxing Li,Yongjae Lee,Deliang Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeLoc3r enhances relative camera pose estimation by training regression networks with Geometric Consistency Regularization (GCR), achieving both fast inference (25ms) and high accuracy approaching correspondence-based methods without geometric computation at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior ReLoc3R achieves fast inference but has subtle geometric inconsistencies preventing it from reaching the precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R, creating a speed-accuracy dilemma.

Method: During training, GeLoc3r uses ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights them via FusionTransformer, computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC, and creates a consistency loss to transfer geometric knowledge into the regression network.

Result: GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R: 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5° on CO3Dv2 (16% improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% on RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500.

Conclusion: GeLoc3r represents a paradigm shift by teaching geometric consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, achieving both regression speed and geometric understanding of correspondence methods.

Abstract: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and
state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric
inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the
precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require
300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative
camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric
Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma
by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses
without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r
leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights
them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and
computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a
consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression
network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving
at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time,
maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On
challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving
significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2
dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on
RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric
consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r
represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry,
achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of
correspondence methods.

### [42] [MMeViT: Multi-Modal ensemble ViT for Post-Stroke Rehabilitation Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23044)
*Ye-eun Kim,Suhyeon Lim,Andrew J. Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep learning-based multimodal system for recognizing upper limb Activities of Daily Living (ADL) in stroke patients using IMU sensors and RGB-D camera, addressing the gap in existing HAR research that primarily focuses on non-disabled individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a shortage of rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients despite increasing demand. Remote monitoring systems can reduce medical staff burden, but existing Human Action Recognition (HAR) technologies are unsuitable for stroke patients as they focus on non-disabled individuals and use simpler machine learning approaches.

Method: Designed a monitoring system using IMU sensors and RGB-D camera to collect stroke patient action data. Investigated appropriate preprocessing methods and proposed a deep learning model (MMeViT) suitable for processing multimodal data from stroke patients.

Result: Found that stroke patient action data is less clustered than non-disabled individuals' data. The proposed model learns similar tendencies for each label even in data with difficult-to-cluster features. The code is publicly available.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of deep learning models trained on stroke patient data to expand beyond simple action recognition to include assessment feedback for domiciliary rehabilitation, contributing to future remote rehabilitation systems.

Abstract: Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage despite
the increasing demand. To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that
reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key
component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR)
technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have
primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for
recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely
concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning
rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the
actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of
Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors
and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly
collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess
and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We
analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke
patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals.
Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for
each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study
suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has
learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action
recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary
rehabilitation in future research. The code presented in this study is
available at https://github.com/ye-Kim/MMeViT.

### [43] [Activation Matching for Explanation Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23051)
*Pirzada Suhail,Aditya Anand,Amit Sethi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An activation-matching approach generates minimal binary masks that preserve model predictions and activations while removing irrelevant image regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create faithful, minimal explanations for classifier decisions by preserving both prediction outcomes and intermediate model activations.

Method: Train lightweight autoencoder to output binary masks using multi-layer activation matching (KL divergence + cross-entropy), mask priors (L1 area, binarization penalty, total variation), and abductive constraints.

Result: Produces small, human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding irrelevant input regions.

Conclusion: The approach provides practical and faithful minimalist explanations for model decision-making through activation-preserving binary masks.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate
minimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained
classifier on any given image. Given an input image \(x\) and a frozen model
\(f\), we train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask \(m\) such
that the explanation \(e = m \odot x\) preserves both the model's prediction
and the intermediate activations of \(x\). Our objective combines: (i)
multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence to align distributions and
cross-entropy to retain the top-1 label for both the image and the explanation;
(ii) mask priors -- L1 area for minimality, a binarization penalty for crisp
0/1 masks, and total variation for compactness; and (iii) abductive constraints
for faithfulness and necessity. Together, these objectives yield small,
human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding
irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist
explanations for the decision making of the underlying model.

*Ruilang Wang,Shuotong Xu,Bowen Liu,Runlin Huang,Donglong Chen,Weifeng Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mask What Matters is a text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image analysis that uses vision-language models to selectively mask diagnostically relevant regions, improving efficiency and semantic alignment over random high-ratio masking approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of data scarcity in medical imaging and the inefficiency of existing self-supervised masked image modeling methods that rely on random high-ratio masking, which leads to poor semantic alignment and limited adaptability across tasks and modalities.

Method: Proposes a controllable text-guided masking framework that leverages vision-language models for prompt-based region localization, applying differentiated masking to emphasize diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas.

Result: Outperforms existing MIM methods across multiple medical imaging modalities (brain MRI, chest CT, lung X-ray) with gains of up to +3.1 percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in BoxAP, and +1.1 in MaskAP for detection, while using substantially lower masking ratios (40% vs 70%).

Conclusion: Controllable, text-driven masking enables semantically aligned self-supervised learning and advances the development of robust vision models for medical image analysis by improving representation learning and cross-task generalizability.

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging
presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While
self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution,
existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to
inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants
typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting
their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a
controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image
analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region
localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize
diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas.
This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved
representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including
brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently
outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1
percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision
(BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it
achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios
(e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven
masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the
development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

### [45] [FMC-DETR: Frequency-Decoupled Multi-Domain Coordination for Aerial-View Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23056)
*Ben Liang,Yuan Liu,Bingwen Qiu,Yihong Wang,Xiubao Sui,Qian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMC-DETR is a novel aerial-view object detection framework that uses frequency-decoupled fusion to address tiny object detection challenges in high-resolution imagery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with detecting tiny objects in aerial imagery due to delayed contextual fusion, inadequate non-linear modeling, and difficulty in using global information to refine shallow features, leading to performance bottlenecks.

Method: Proposes FMC-DETR with three key components: WeKat backbone using wavelet transforms and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for global context and non-linear modeling, Cross-stage Partial Fusion module for efficient multi-scale interaction, and Multi-Domain Feature Coordination module unifying spatial, frequency, and structural priors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 improvements over baseline on VisDrone dataset, while using fewer parameters.

Conclusion: FMC-DETR effectively addresses tiny object detection challenges in aerial imagery through frequency-decoupled fusion and multi-domain coordination, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Aerial-view object detection is a critical technology for real-world
applications such as natural resource monitoring, traffic management, and
UAV-based search and rescue. Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial
imagery presents a long-standing challenge due to their limited visual cues and
the difficulty of modeling global context in complex scenes. Existing methods
are often hampered by delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear
modeling, failing to effectively use global information to refine shallow
features and thus encountering a performance bottleneck. To address these
challenges, we propose FMC-DETR, a novel framework with frequency-decoupled
fusion for aerial-view object detection. First, we introduce the Wavelet
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which applies cascaded wavelet
transforms to enhance global low-frequency context perception in shallow
features while preserving fine-grained details, and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold
networks to achieve adaptive non-linear modeling of multi-scale dependencies.
Next, a lightweight Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module reduces redundancy
and improves multi-scale feature interaction. Finally, we introduce the
Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module, which unifies spatial,
frequency, and structural priors to to balance detail preservation and global
enhancement. Extensive experiments on benchmark aerial-view datasets
demonstrate that FMC-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer
parameters. On the challenging VisDrone dataset, our model achieves
improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over the baseline, highlighting its
effectiveness in tiny object detection. The code can be accessed at

*Yutao Shen,Junkun Yuan,Toru Aonishi,Hideki Nakayama,Yue Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper revisits fundamental problems in image inpainting preference alignment using direct preference optimization, finding that most reward models provide valid scores for preference data construction, and that simple ensemble methods can mitigate biases and achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate fundamental problems in achieving preference alignment for image inpainting rather than introducing new methods, and to establish a solid baseline for this promising research direction.

Method: Leveraged direct preference optimization for alignment training, employed public reward models to construct preference training datasets, conducted experiments across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models with varying structures and generative algorithms.

Result: Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for preference data construction; preference data shows robust trends in candidate and sample scaling; observable biases in reward models make them susceptible to reward hacking; simple ensemble methods yield robust and generalizable results by mitigating biases.

Conclusion: The alignment models significantly outperform prior models across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations without changing model structures or using new datasets, setting a simple yet solid baseline for image inpainting preference alignment.

Abstract: This paper investigates image inpainting with preference alignment. Instead
of introducing a novel method, we go back to basics and revisit fundamental
problems in achieving such alignment. We leverage the prominent direct
preference optimization approach for alignment training and employ public
reward models to construct preference training datasets. Experiments are
conducted across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models
with varying structures and generative algorithms. Our key findings are as
follows: (1) Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for constructing
preference data, even if some of them are not reliable evaluators. (2)
Preference data demonstrates robust trends in both candidate scaling and sample
scaling across models and benchmarks. (3) Observable biases in reward models,
particularly in brightness, composition, and color scheme, render them
susceptible to cause reward hacking. (4) A simple ensemble of these models
yields robust and generalizable results by mitigating such biases. Built upon
these observations, our alignment models significantly outperform prior models
across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations, without any
changes to model structures or the use of new datasets. We hope our work can
set a simple yet solid baseline, pushing this promising frontier. Our code is

*Ziyu Su,Abdul Rehman Akbar,Usama Sajjad,Anil V. Parwani,Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XMAG is a lightweight foundation model for computational pathology that uses cross-magnification distillation from 20x to 5x magnification, achieving comparable accuracy to larger models with 30x faster processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models in computational pathology are computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to massive parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements.

Method: Cross-magnification distillation transfers knowledge from 20x magnification teacher to 5x magnification student architecture, using dual-level knowledge transfer (global image representations and local spatial token mapping) and trained on 3.49 million images.

Result: XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within 1% of larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold processing acceleration (8.8 WSIs per minute) and requiring 11.3 times fewer patches per WSI.

Conclusion: Cross-magnification distillation enables deployment of foundation model capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain
computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive
parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we
introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification
distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification
teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a
compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer
patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel
distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning
both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained
XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and
evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis
tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within
1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold
processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our
cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we
developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's
performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish
cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM
capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially
enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

*Na Min An,Inha Kang,Minhyun Lee,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPatch is a zero-shot referring image segmentation framework that enhances spatial representations in both text and image modalities without additional training, improving spatial grounding across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundational vision-language models like CLIP struggle with spatial relationships - they focus on primary noun phrases in text and generate similar features for images with different spatial layouts, limiting spatial structure sensitivity.

Method: CoPatch constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context tokens with spatial cues, extracts patch-level image features from intermediate layers where spatial structure is better preserved, and fuses these into a clustered image-text similarity map (CoMap) for mask selection.

Result: CoPatch significantly improves spatial grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut benchmarks (+2-7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of recovering and leveraging untapped spatial knowledge inherently embedded in VLMs, opening opportunities for zero-shot referring image segmentation.

Abstract: Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where
the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current
foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning
images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within
the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun
phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens.
Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with
different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial
structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a
zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance
spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language,
\textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context
tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image
features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where
spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a
clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask
selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial
grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+
2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore
the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge
inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in
zero-shot RIS.

TL;DR: HTMA-Net combines Hadamard Transform with multiplication-avoiding SRAM-based in-memory computing to reduce arithmetic complexity in deep neural networks while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing multiplication costs is critical for efficient deep neural network deployment in energy-constrained edge devices.

Method: Selectively replaces intermediate convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations.

Result: Eliminates up to 52% of multiplications compared to baseline ResNet models while achieving comparable accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets.

Conclusion: Combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards efficient deep learning architectures.

Abstract: Reducing the cost of multiplications is critical for efficient deep neural
network deployment, especially in energy-constrained edge devices. In this
work, we introduce HTMA-Net, a novel framework that integrates the Hadamard
Transform (HT) with multiplication-avoiding (MA) SRAM-based in-memory computing
to reduce arithmetic complexity while maintaining accuracy. Unlike prior
methods that only target multiplications in convolutional layers or focus
solely on in-memory acceleration, HTMA-Net selectively replaces intermediate
convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal
convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations.
We evaluate HTMA-Net on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet,
and provide a detailed comparison against regular, MF-only, and HT-only
variants. Results show that HTMA-Net eliminates up to 52\% of multiplications
compared to baseline ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-50 models, while
achieving comparable accuracy in evaluation and significantly reducing
computational complexity and the number of parameters. Our results demonstrate
that combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory
computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards
efficient deep learning architectures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChangeIMTI dataset for remote sensing change understanding and proposes ChangeVG model with vision-guided dual-branch architecture for multi-task learning across change captioning, classification, counting, and localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions for diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks in remote sensing change understanding (RSCU).

Method: Constructed ChangeIMTI dataset and designed ChangeVG model with vision-guided dual-branch architecture combining fine-grained spatial features with high-level semantic summarization to guide large VLMs during instruction tuning.

Result: Outperforms strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on S*m metric for change captioning, and shows superiority across all four tasks through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses gaps in remote sensing change understanding through comprehensive dataset construction and hierarchical cross-modal learning architecture.

Abstract: Remote sensing change understanding (RSCU) is essential for analyzing remote
sensing images and understanding how human activities affect the environment.
However, existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in the
diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks. To tackle these
gaps, we construct ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task
instruction dataset that encompasses four complementary tasks including change
captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change
localization. Building upon this new dataset, we further design a novel
vision-guided vision-language model (ChangeVG) with dual-granularity awareness
for bi-temporal remote sensing images (i.e., two remote sensing images of the
same area at different times). The introduced vision-guided module is a
dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial
feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization. These enriched
representations further serve as the auxiliary prompts to guide large
vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) during instruction tuning,
thereby facilitating the hierarchical cross-modal learning. We extensively
conduct experiments across four tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Remarkably, on the change captioning task, our method outperforms the
strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric,
which integrates the semantic similarity and descriptive accuracy to provide an
overall evaluation of change caption. Moreover, we also perform a series of
ablation studies to examine the critical components of our method.

TL;DR: A unified multistage generative framework using Conditional Dependent Coupling that addresses trade-offs between computation and fidelity in image generation by enabling end-to-end optimization through a single Diffusion Transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing image generation models including VAE-based models' information loss and pixel-space models' high computational cost, while addressing cascade models' issues with stage-wise separation and ineffective optimization.

Method: Proposes a unified multistage framework with Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy that decomposes generation into interpolant trajectories across multiple stages, implemented as a single Diffusion Transformer for end-to-end training.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions, outperforming existing approaches in balancing computational cost and image quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses key challenges in image generation by enabling accurate distribution learning, end-to-end optimization, and knowledge sharing through a unified architecture.

Abstract: Existing image generation models face critical challenges regarding the
trade-off between computation and fidelity. Specifically, models relying on a
pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) suffer from information loss, limited
detail, and the inability to support end-to-end training. In contrast, models
operating directly in the pixel space incur prohibitive computational cost.
Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation
prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and
often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage. To address
these challenges, we introduce a unified multistage generative framework based
on our proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes the
generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, ensuring
accurate distribution learning while enabling end-to-end optimization.
Importantly, the entire process is modeled as a single unified Diffusion
Transformer, eliminating the need for disjoint modules and also enabling
knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions.

TL;DR: Earth-Agent is the first agentic framework that unifies RGB and spectral Earth observation data with MCP-based tools, enabling cross-modal, multi-step reasoning beyond current MLLMs, supported by the Earth-Bench evaluation benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack capability for complex EO tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and domain-specific tools, while existing agent-based methods are limited to RGB perception and shallow reasoning without systematic evaluation.

Method: Earth-Agent integrates RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool ecosystem, enabling dynamic invocation of expert tools and models across modalities for geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal analysis.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show Earth-Agent's effectiveness across different LLM backbones, outperforming general agent frameworks and MLLMs on remote sensing benchmarks, with Earth-Bench providing 248 expert-curated tasks across 13,729 images.

Conclusion: Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, advancing the field toward scientifically grounded, next-generation LLM applications in Earth observation.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is essential for understanding the evolving states of
the Earth system. Although recent MLLMs have advanced EO research, they still
lack the capability to tackle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning
and the use of domain-specific tools. Agent-based methods offer a promising
direction, but current attempts remain in their infancy, confined to RGB
perception, shallow reasoning, and lacking systematic evaluation protocols. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic
framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool
ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal
reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific
tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal
analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To
support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark
of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and
RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that
assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct
comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with
general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing
benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent.
Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward
scientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth
observation. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.

TL;DR: WeatherCycle is a unified unpaired framework for multi-weather image restoration that uses bidirectional degradation-content translation with degradation-aware curriculum regularization, achieving state-of-the-art unsupervised performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on task-specific physical priors, limiting scalability and generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. There's a need for a unified approach that can handle multiple weather degradations without paired training data.

Method: Proposes WeatherCycle with: 1) Lumina-chroma decomposition to decouple degradation from content, 2) Lumina Degradation Guidance Module (LDGM) that learns luminance degradation priors and injects them via frequency-domain amplitude modulation, 3) Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR) that identifies hard samples and enforces contrastive alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple weather datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches with strong generalization to complex weather degradations.

Conclusion: WeatherCycle provides an effective unified framework for multi-weather image restoration that outperforms existing unsupervised methods and generalizes well to diverse weather conditions.

Abstract: Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions remains a
fundamental yet underexplored challenge. While existing methods often rely on
task-specific physical priors, their narrow focus limits scalability and
generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. In this work, we
propose \textbf{WeatherCycle}, a unified unpaired framework that reformulates
weather restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle,
guided by degradation-aware curriculum regularization. At its core,
WeatherCycle employs a \textit{lumina-chroma decomposition} strategy to
decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling
domain conversion between degraded and clean images. To model diverse and
complex degradations, we propose a \textit{Lumina Degradation Guidance Module}
(LDGM), which learns luminance degradation priors from a degraded image pool
and injects them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation,
enabling controllable and realistic degradation modeling. Additionally, we
incorporate a \textit{Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR)}
module that identifies hard samples via a CLIP-based classifier and enforces
contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features to enhance
semantic consistency and robustness. Extensive experiments across serve
multi-weather datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance among unsupervised approaches, with strong generalization to
complex weather degradations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparse2Dense is a keypoint-driven framework that uses sparse 3D keypoints for ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction, enabling bandwidth-efficient human-centric applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of achieving ultra-low bitrate human video compression while maintaining accurate vertex prediction, which requires harmonizing dynamic motion modeling, appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency.

Method: Proposes a multi-task learning-based generative model that encodes human motion via compact 3D keypoints, uses these sparse keypoints to estimate dense motion for video synthesis, and integrates a vertex predictor for joint optimization of video generation and geometry learning.

Result: Achieves competitive compression performance compared to traditional/generative video codecs while enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.

Conclusion: Sparse2Dense facilitates bandwidth-efficient human-centric media transmission for applications like real-time motion analysis, virtual human animation, and immersive entertainment.

Abstract: For bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications, simultaneously achieving
ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction
remains a critical challenge, as it demands the harmonization of dynamic motion
modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency. To address
this challenge, we propose Sparse2Dense, a keypoint-driven generative framework
that leverages extremely sparse 3D keypoints as compact transmitted symbols to
enable ultra-low bitrate human video compression and precise human vertex
prediction. The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and
keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion
via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense
motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures.
Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry
through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between
visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression
performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst
enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.
As such, Sparse2Dense is expected to facilitate bandwidth-efficient
human-centric media transmission, such as real-time motion analysis, virtual
human animation, and immersive entertainment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end video-based pipeline for vehicle axle counting using YOLO-OBB for vehicle detection and YOLO for tire detection, with a novel TRAX algorithm to handle occlusions and improve accuracy for long vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate vehicle axle counting is essential for traffic control, toll collection, and infrastructure development, but previous methods have limitations in dense environments with occlusions and long vehicles.

Method: Combines YOLO-OBB for vehicle detection/categorization and YOLO for tire detection, with intelligent tire-to-vehicle association and a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to handle occlusions and track axle features between frames.

Result: Significantly reduces false positives and improves axle-counting accuracy for long vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos.

Conclusion: Represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting systems that can replace legacy roadside infrastructure with machine vision.

Abstract: Accurate counting of vehicle axles is essential for traffic control, toll
collection, and infrastructure development. We present an end-to-end,
video-based pipeline for axle counting that tackles limitations of previous
works in dense environments. Our system leverages a combination of YOLO-OBB to
detect and categorize vehicles, and YOLO to detect tires. Detected tires are
intelligently associated to their respective parent vehicles, enabling accurate
axle prediction even in complex scenarios. However, there are a few challenges
in detection when it comes to scenarios with longer and occluded vehicles. We
mitigate vehicular occlusions and partial detections for longer vehicles by
proposing a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to successfully track
axle-related features between frames. Our method stands out by significantly
reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of axle-counting for long
vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos. This
work represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting
systems, paving the way for machine vision to replace legacy roadside
infrastructure.

### [58] [Confidence-Calibrating Regularization for Robust Brain MRI Segmentation Under Domain Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23176)
*Behraj Khan,Tahir Qasim Syed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalSAM adapts SAM for medical volumes by reducing domain shift sensitivity with Feature Fisher Information Penalty and penalizing overconfident errors with Confidence Misalignment Penalty, improving accuracy and calibration while keeping encoders frozen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM performs well on natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to medical volumes like brain MRI, requiring adaptation for reliable medical segmentation.

Method: Lightweight adaptation framework that fine-tunes only the mask decoder using two penalties: Feature Fisher Information Penalty (FIP) to reduce encoder sensitivity to domain shift, and Confidence Misalignment Penalty (CMP) to penalize overconfident voxel-wise errors.

Result: Significant improvements in cross-center and scanner-shift evaluations: +7.4% DSC improvement, -26.9% HD95 reduction, -39.5% ECE reduction on BraTS scanner split; +5.3% DSC improvement, -32.6% ECE reduction on ATLAS-C motion corruptions.

Conclusion: CalSAM delivers improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for brain MRI segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency by freezing SAM's encoder, with FIP and CMP providing complementary benefits.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits strong zero-shot performance on
natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to
medical volumes. We propose \textbf{CalSAM}, a lightweight adaptation framework
that (i) reduces encoder sensitivity to domain shift via a \emph{Feature Fisher
Information Penalty} (FIP) computed on 3D feature maps and (ii) penalizes
overconfident voxel-wise errors through a \emph{Confidence Misalignment
Penalty} (CMP). The combined loss, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CalSAM}}\) fine-tunes
only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen. On cross-center and
scanner-shift evaluations, CalSAM substantially improves accuracy and
calibration: e.g., on the BraTS scanner split (Siemens$\to$GE) CalSAM shows a
$+7.4\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$ (80.1\% vs.\ 74.6\%), a
$-26.9\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{HD95}$ (4.6 mm vs.\ 6.3 mm), and a $-39.5\%$
reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.2\% vs.\ 8.6\%). On ATLAS-C (motion
corruptions), CalSAM achieves a $+5.3\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$
(75.9\%) and a $-32.6\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.8\%). Ablations show
FIP and CMP contribute complementary gains ($p<0.01$), and the Fisher penalty
incurs a modest $\sim$15\% training-time overhead. CalSAM therefore delivers
improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for
brain MRI segmentation, while retaining the computational benefits of freezing
SAM's encoder.

TL;DR: A new unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation framework that uses synthetic point cloud generation, flexible temporal sampling, and dynamic-weighting loss to overcome limitations of existing methods like UNIT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised 3D instance segmentation methods suffer from limited training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy pseudo-labels, which hinders consistent object identity tracking across LiDAR scans.

Method: Proposes synthetic point cloud sequence generation for training diversity, flexible temporal sampling using both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, and dynamic-weighting loss to emphasize confident samples.

Result: Outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet datasets, achieving higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses key limitations in unsupervised 3D instance segmentation through synthetic data generation, flexible temporal modeling, and adaptive loss weighting, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging
task, as it requires maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR
scans without relying on annotated training data. Existing methods, such as
UNIT, have made progress in this direction but remain constrained by limited
training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy
pseudo-labels. We propose a new framework that enriches the training
distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, enabling
greater diversity without relying on manual labels or simulation engines. To
better capture temporal dynamics, our method incorporates a flexible sampling
strategy that leverages both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, allowing the
model to learn from long-range dependencies as well as short-term variations.
In addition, a dynamic-weighting loss emphasizes confident and informative
samples, guiding the network toward more robust representations. Through
extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet, our method
consistently outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines, achieving
higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations. The code
will be publicly available at github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D.

TL;DR: GaP (Gaussian Patch) is a black-box adversarial attack method that creates a universal, physically transferable forehead patch using Gaussian blobs to degrade face recognition systems with high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most adversarial attacks on face recognition systems are limited to digital domains or require white-box access, creating a need for practical black-box attacks that can work in physical settings.

Method: Uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to iteratively construct symmetric grayscale patterns on the forehead by adding Gaussian blobs, guided by cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model.

Result: Achieves high attack success rate in both digital and real-world physical tests with only ~10,000 queries, and shows strong transferability by successfully attacking an unseen FaceNet model.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a practical and severe vulnerability in face recognition systems, proving that robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the target system.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition (FR) systems pose a significant
security threat, yet most are confined to the digital domain or require
white-box access. We introduce GaP (Gaussian Patch), a novel method to generate
a universal, physically transferable adversarial patch under a strict black-box
setting. Our approach uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to
iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale pattern for the forehead. The
patch is optimized by successively adding Gaussian blobs, guided only by the
cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to maximally degrade
identity recognition. We demonstrate that with approximately 10,000 queries to
a black-box ArcFace model, the resulting GaP achieves a high attack success
rate in both digital and real-world physical tests. Critically, the attack
shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an entirely unseen FaceNet
model. Our work highlights a practical and severe vulnerability, proving that
robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the
target system.

### [62] [Patch Rebirth: Toward Fast and Transferable Model Inversion of Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23235)
*Seongsoo Heo,Dong-Wan Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRI is a novel model inversion method that incrementally detaches important patches during inversion to create sparse synthetic images while allowing remaining patches to continue evolving, achieving 10x faster inversion than standard methods while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard model inversion for Vision Transformers is computationally expensive due to self-attention mechanisms. Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) improves efficiency but discards patches prematurely, suppressing extraction of essential class-agnostic features needed for knowledge transfer.

Method: Patch Rebirth Inversion (PRI) progressively detaches the most important patches during inversion to construct sparse synthetic images, while allowing remaining patches to continue evolving for future selection. This enables initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate class-relevant knowledge.

Result: PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than standard Dense Model Inversion and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.

Conclusion: PRI effectively balances class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge through progressive patch detachment, demonstrating that allowing patches to continue evolving rather than discarding them prematurely leads to more efficient and effective model inversion.

Abstract: Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that
reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative
optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its
application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major
computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To
address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency
by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even
claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings
suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire
transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that
discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses
the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer,
along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth
Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most
important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic
images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future
selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also
encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more
class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect,
thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge.
Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than
standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently
outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-consistency framework that uses short binary questions to evaluate and rank model responses, automatically generating preference pairs to reduce hallucinations without external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability, and existing methods require extensive human annotations or external supervision.

Method: Leverages model's self-consistency between long responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training, using a self-reflection pipeline where detailed responses are compared against concise binary answers.

Result: Significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability across multiple benchmarks (AMBER, MultiObject-Hal, Object HalBench, MMHal-Bench), while maintaining robust instruction-following ability on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled data, relying solely on self-consistency rather than external supervision.

Abstract: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent
objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing
methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or
external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a
novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long
responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We
observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses,
which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated
responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed
model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency
signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without
human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on
self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable
and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled
data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER,
MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate
significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our
approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by
enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

TL;DR: TATTOO introduces a training-free aesthetic-aware outfit recommendation approach using Multimodal Large Language Models to generate item descriptions and aesthetic profiles, achieving state-of-the-art performance without expensive labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fashion outfit-completion tools require expensive task-specific training on large-scale labeled data and lack explicit human aesthetics guidance. The rise of MLLMs enables a more efficient training-free paradigm.

Method: TATTOO uses MLLMs to generate target-item descriptions and aesthetic chain-of-thought to distill images into structured aesthetic profiles. It fuses visual summaries with textual descriptions using dynamic entropy-gated mechanism for candidate ranking in shared embedding space.

Result: Experiments on Aesthetic-100 show TATTOO achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to training-based methods. Polyvore dataset validates advanced zero-shot retrieval capability.

Conclusion: The training-free paradigm using MLLMs outperforms conventional training-based approaches in fashion outfit recommendation, providing better aesthetic awareness and recommendation scores without expensive data labeling.

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce market relies significantly on intelligent and
aesthetic-aware outfit-completion tools to promote sales. While previous
studies have approached the problem of fashion outfit-completion and
compatible-item retrieval, most of them require expensive, task-specific
training on large-scale labeled data, and no effort is made to guide outfit
recommendation with explicit human aesthetics. In the era of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), we show that the conventional training-based pipeline
could be streamlined to a training-free paradigm, with better recommendation
scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness. We achieve this with TATTOO, a
Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recommendation approach. It first
generates a target-item description using MLLMs, followed by an aesthetic
chain-of-thought used to distill the images into a structured aesthetic profile
including color, style, occasion, season, material, and balance. By fusing the
visual summary of the outfit with the textual description and aesthetics
vectors using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism, candidate items can be
represented in a shared embedding space and be ranked accordingly. Experiments
on a real-world evaluation set Aesthetic-100 show that TATTOO achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared with existing training-based methods.
Another standard Polyvore dataset is also used to measure the advanced
zero-shot retrieval capability of our training-free method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal imaging improves ADAS safety in low-light and harsh weather, but faces dataset limitations and poor simulator representation. Existing RGB-to-thermal methods only support one-to-one mappings.

Method: Multi-modal translation framework with Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN) that adapts styles to different image components individually, unlike global style application in original AdaIN.

Result: More realistic and diverse thermal image translations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CoAdaIN enables effective one-to-many RGB-to-thermal mapping, addressing dataset limitations for thermal imaging in ADAS applications.

Abstract: Thermal imaging in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) improves road
safety with superior perception in low-light and harsh weather conditions
compared to traditional RGB cameras. However, research in this area faces
challenges due to limited dataset availability and poor representation in
driving simulators. RGB-to-thermal image translation offers a potential
solution, but existing methods focus on one-to-one mappings. We propose a
one-to-many mapping using a multi-modal translation framework enhanced with our
Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN). Unlike the original
AdaIN, which applies styles globally, CoAdaIN adapts styles to different image
components individually. The result, as we show, is more realistic and diverse
thermal image translations. This is the accepted author manuscript of the paper

Motivation: To develop a privacy-preserving alternative to camera-based activity recognition that is robust to illumination changes, using LiDAR point clouds which preserve privacy while capturing human movement.

Method: Map LiDAR frames to proximity graphs (epsilon-graphs), compute Laplacian spectrum, use eigenvalues and eigenvector statistics as pose descriptors, and apply temporal statistics over sliding windows for classification with SVM and random forests.

Result: Achieved 94.4% accuracy on 13-class rehabilitation activities and 90.3% accuracy on all 27 activities in MM-Fi dataset with 40 subjects under strict subject-independent protocol, outperforming skeleton-based baselines.

Conclusion: The method provides a compact, interpretable feature set derived directly from point cloud geometry, offering an accurate and efficient alternative to end-to-end deep learning for human activity recognition.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition supports applications in healthcare,
manufacturing, and human-machine interaction. LiDAR point clouds offer a
privacy-preserving alternative to cameras and are robust to illumination. We
propose a HAR method based on graph spectral analysis. Each LiDAR frame is
mapped to a proximity graph (epsilon-graph) and the Laplacian spectrum is
computed. Eigenvalues and statistics of eigenvectors form pose descriptors, and
temporal statistics over sliding windows yield fixed vectors for classification
with support vector machines and random forests. On the MM-Fi dataset with 40
subjects and 27 activities, under a strict subject-independent protocol, the
method reaches 94.4% accuracy on a 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% on all
27 activities. It also surpasses the skeleton-based baselines reported for
MM-Fi. The contribution is a compact and interpretable feature set derived
directly from point cloud geometry that provides an accurate and efficient
alternative to end-to-end deep learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OracleGS reconciles generative completeness with regressive fidelity for sparse-view novel view synthesis by using a "propose-and-validate" framework that leverages a 3D-aware diffusion model to propose complete scenes and an MVS model as an oracle to validate 3D uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is ill-posed due to geometric ambiguity, creating a trade-off where regressive models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, while generative models can complete scenes but introduce structural inconsistencies.

Method: A "propose-and-validate" framework: first uses a pre-trained 3D-aware diffusion model to synthesize novel views and propose complete scenes, then repurposes a multi-view stereo model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate 3D uncertainties using attention maps, guiding 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization via uncertainty-weighted loss.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic by filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible completions in under-constrained regions.

Conclusion: OracleGS successfully conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric evidence, reconciling generative completeness with regressive fidelity for sparse-view Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe
geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive
models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can
complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose
OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with
regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using
generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our
"propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware
diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then
repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the
3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions
where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus
where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of
texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the
optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss.
Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric
evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible
completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.

Method: Uses attention-guided U-Net architecture with seven geospatial modalities (temperature, vegetation, soil moisture, humidity, wind, elevation, land use) at 1 km resolution, with focal and dice loss functions to handle class imbalance.

Result: The multimodal framework consistently outperforms unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, particularly in extreme rainfall categories.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable framework, benchmark dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting and climate resilience applications in India.

Abstract: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is vital for India's agriculture, water
management, and climate risk planning, yet remains challenging due to sparse
ground observations and complex regional variability. We present a multimodal
deep learning framework for high-resolution precipitation classification that
leverages satellite and Earth observation data. Unlike previous rainfall
prediction models based on coarse 5-50 km grids, we curate a new 1 km
resolution dataset for five Indian states, integrating seven key geospatial
modalities: land surface temperature, vegetation (NDVI), soil moisture,
relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, and land use, covering the
June-September 2024 monsoon season. Our approach uses an attention-guided U-Net
architecture to capture spatial patterns and temporal dependencies across
modalities, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall
class imbalance defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal framework consistently outperforms
unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially in extreme
rainfall categories. This work contributes a scalable framework, benchmark
dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate
resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

*Yihao Ding,Soyeon Caren Han,Yanbei Jiang,Yan Li,Zechuan Li,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynDoc is a framework combining discriminative and generative models for domain-specific document understanding, using synthetic data generation and adaptive instruction tuning to overcome limitations of existing LLMs/MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large (Multimodal) Language Models face limitations including hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance on extensive fine-tuning datasets for domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding in sensitive fields like medicine, finance, and material science.

Method: SynDoc employs a synthetic data generation workflow with structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation, adaptive instruction tuning for discriminative models, and a recursive inferencing mechanism to iteratively refine outputs from both models.

Result: The framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding, bridging the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

Conclusion: SynDoc effectively addresses domain-specific VRDU challenges by combining discriminative and generative models with synthetic data generation and recursive refinement, providing stable and accurate predictions without extensive fine-tuning datasets.

Abstract: Domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) presents
significant challenges due to the complexity and sensitivity of documents in
fields such as medicine, finance, and material science. Existing Large
(Multimodal) Language Models (LLMs/MLLMs) achieve promising results but face
limitations such as hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance
on extensive fine-tuning datasets. This paper introduces SynDoc, a novel
framework that combines discriminative and generative models to address these
challenges. SynDoc employs a robust synthetic data generation workflow, using
structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation to
produce high-quality annotations. Through adaptive instruction tuning, SynDoc
improves the discriminative model's ability to extract domain-specific
knowledge. At the same time, a recursive inferencing mechanism iteratively
refines the output of both models for stable and accurate predictions. This
framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding
and bridges the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world
knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vid-Freeze is an adversarial attack method that adds perturbations to images to block motion synthesis in image-to-video generation models while preserving image semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks of malicious content creation enabled by I2V generation models, providing effective protection against motion synthesis.

Method: Attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted perturbations to images, explicitly targeting the attention mechanism of I2V models.

Result: Immunized images generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious content creation while preserving semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: Attention attacks are a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against misuse of I2V generation models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-to-video (I2V) generation models has introduced
significant risks, enabling video synthesis from static images and facilitating
deceptive or malicious content creation. While prior defenses such as I2VGuard
attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel
attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted
adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the
attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while
preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images
generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious
content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection
provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention
attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against
misuse of I2V generation models.

### [71] [Seeing Through the Blur: Unlocking Defocus Maps for Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23289)
*Minsun Jeon,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using defocus blur as a physically interpretable forensic signal for deepfake detection, leveraging the natural depth-dependent optical phenomenon that occurs in camera-captured images but is often missing in synthetic content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled mass production of photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and fabricated visual content, threatening the integrity of visual media.

Method: Construct a defocus blur map from images and use it as a discriminative feature for detection, leveraging that defocus blur naturally occurs in camera-captured images due to lens focus and scene geometry but is often unrealistic in synthetic images.

Result: Experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images, supported by three in-depth feature analyses.

Conclusion: Defocus blur serves as an effective forensic signal for deepfake detection due to its universal optical imaging principles and physical scene structure encoding, making it robust and generalizable.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the mass production of
photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and
fabricated visual content. This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake
scenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader
AI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such
content becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the
integrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a
physically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that
defocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a
depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured
images due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images
often lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these
discrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative
feature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or
frequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging
principles and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and
generalizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature
analyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a
reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. We aim for our
defocus-based detection pipeline and interpretability tools to contribute
meaningfully to ongoing research in media forensics. The implementation is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-SPK is the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike camera data that effectively handles low-light high-speed scenarios by leveraging generative priors and enhanced texture extraction from inter-spike intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spike cameras produce unique asynchronous spike streams that require reconstruction for human perception, but existing methods struggle with severe noise and sparse information in low-light high-speed scenarios.

Method: The method uses Enhanced Texture from Inter-spike Interval (ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams, then employs ControlNet with ETFI as conditioning input to generate high-speed scenes, plus an ETFI-based feature fusion module for quality improvement.

Result: The method demonstrates superior performance on real low-light spike streams and establishes the first bona fide benchmark for low-light spike stream reconstruction with quantitative illumination information.

Conclusion: Diff-SPK effectively addresses the challenges of spike stream reconstruction in low-light high-speed conditions through diffusion-based generation and enhanced texture extraction, setting a new benchmark for this task.

Abstract: Spike camera, a type of neuromorphic sensor with high-temporal resolution,
shows great promise for high-speed visual tasks. Unlike traditional cameras,
spike camera continuously accumulates photons and fires asynchronous spike
streams. Due to unique data modality, spike streams require reconstruction
methods to become perceptible to the human eye.
  However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light
high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information. In this work,
we propose Diff-SPK, the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike
camera. Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture
information in low-light conditions. Specifically, it first employs an
\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{T}exture \textbf{f}rom Inter-spike \textbf{I}nterval
(ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Then, ETFI
serves as a conditioning input for ControlNet to generate the high-speed
scenes. To improve the quality of results, we introduce an ETFI-based feature
fusion module during the generation process.
  Moreover, we establish the first bona fide benchmark for the low-light spike
stream reconstruction task. It significantly surpasses existing reconstruction
datasets in scale and provides quantitative illumination information. The
performance on real low-light spike streams demonstrates the superiority of
Diff-SPK.

*Hao Liu,Yongjie Zheng,Yuhan Kang,Mingyang Zhang,Maoguo Gong,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes BDGF framework using multimodal diffusion features to guide multi-branch networks for land-cover classification, addressing modality imbalance in DDPMs through adaptive masking and mutual learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address modality imbalance in pre-training multimodal DDPMs and effectively leverage diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature extraction for remote sensing data analysis.

Method: Uses adaptive modality masking strategy for balanced DDPM training, hierarchically guides feature extraction across CNN, Mamba, and transformer networks with fusion mechanisms, and employs mutual learning for inter-branch collaboration.

Result: Extensive experiments on four multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate superior classification performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed BDGF framework effectively addresses modality imbalance in DDPMs and successfully leverages diffusion features to enhance multimodal remote sensing classification performance.

Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing
data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate
complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different
sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have
attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful
ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However,
pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively
leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature
extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper
proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages
multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover
classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy
to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral
image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features
hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer
networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and
cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to
enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and
feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four
multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior classification performance. The code is available at

TL;DR: VLMs show cultural incompetence despite appearing competent, relying on superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding, with systematic biases in identifying cultural imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose that VLMs often appear culturally competent but actually rely on superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding, and to highlight the risks of symbolic shortcuts in multimodal systems.

Method: Introduced a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural imagery through both classification and explanation analysis, testing multiple models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes.

Result: Models correctly identify prominent Western festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as celebrations, exposing systematic biases.

Conclusion: The failures highlight the risks of symbolic shortcuts and emphasize the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C3-OWD is a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning framework that unifies robustness and generalization in object detection by combining RGBT pretraining with vision-language alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object detection methods face a trade-off between robustness (handling adverse conditions) and generalization (detecting unseen categories). Visible-infrared detection improves robustness but lacks generalization, while open-world detection has category diversity but struggles in extreme environments.

Method: Two-stage curriculum learning: Stage 1 uses RGBT data for robustness pretraining, Stage 2 uses vision-language alignment for generalization. An Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism prevents catastrophic forgetting between stages.

Result: Achieves 80.1 AP50 on FLIR, 48.6 AP50_Novel on OV-COCO, and 35.7 mAP_r on OV-LVIS, demonstrating competitive performance across both robustness and diversity evaluations.

Conclusion: C3-OWD successfully unifies robustness and generalization in object detection through curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning, overcoming the traditional trade-off between these two objectives.

Abstract: Object detection has advanced significantly in the closed-set setting, but
real-world deployment remains limited by two challenges: poor generalization to
unseen categories and insufficient robustness under adverse conditions. Prior
research has explored these issues separately: visible-infrared detection
improves robustness but lacks generalization, while open-world detection
leverages vision-language alignment strategy for category diversity but
struggles under extreme environments. This trade-off leaves robustness and
diversity difficult to achieve simultaneously. To mitigate these issues, we
propose \textbf{C3-OWD}, a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning
framework that unifies both strengths. Stage~1 enhances robustness by
pretraining with RGBT data, while Stage~2 improves generalization via
vision-language alignment. To prevent catastrophic forgetting between two
stages, we introduce an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism that
theoretically guarantees preservation of pre-stage performance with bounded
parameter lag and function consistency. Experiments on FLIR, OV-COCO, and
OV-LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: C3-OWD achieves $80.1$
AP$^{50}$ on FLIR, $48.6$ AP$^{50}_{\text{Novel}}$ on OV-COCO, and $35.7$
mAP$_r$ on OV-LVIS, establishing competitive performance across both robustness
and diversity evaluations. Code available at:

*Yizhen Jiang,Mengting Ma,Anqi Zhu,Xiaowen Ma,Jiaxin Li,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes S2BNet, a binary neural network for remote sensing pansharpening that addresses spectral distortion and spatial feature degradation issues through customized Spatial-Spectral Binarized Convolution (S2B-Conv).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for pansharpening have high computational complexity, limiting their use on resource-limited devices. Binary neural networks (BNNs) offer efficiency but face spectral distortion and spatial feature degradation when applied to pansharpening.

Method: Designed S2B-Conv with two components: Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM) using affine transformation with dynamic parameters, and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA) that handles multi-scale and directional features through random frequency/angle selection.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed high-efficiency binarized method achieves promising performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: S2BNet successfully applies binary neural networks to pansharpening by overcoming spectral and spatial challenges, enabling efficient deployment on resource-limited devices while maintaining good performance.

Abstract: Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties
during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution
multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution
multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have
achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational
complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In
this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network
(BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with
binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious
spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the
PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to
adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing
objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above
issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution
(S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM)
and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine
transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic
learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles
within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional
spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for
pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can
attain a promising performance.

*Hongrui Jia,Chaoya Jiang,Shikun Zhang,Wei Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free visual-reasoning pipeline that decouples reasoning and perception, using an LLM to orchestrate reasoning while a LMM serves as a visual QA engine to prevent visual grounding loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic and lose visual grounding as reasoning chains extend, leading to reasoning paths that diverge from image content and cause errors.

Method: Decouple reasoning and perception: a powerful LLM orchestrates high-level reasoning and strategically interrogates a LMM, which functions exclusively as a visual question-answering engine to supply perceptual details on demand.

Result: Significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and substantial improvement in reasoning fidelity, validated through comprehensive evaluations.

Conclusion: The lightweight, plug-and-play approach effectively governs visual reasoning without requiring additional training or architectural changes.

Abstract: Significant advancements in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) are now driven by test-time scaling laws, particularly those
leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Inspired by these
breakthroughs, researchers have extended these paradigms to Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs). However, a critical limitation emerges: as their reasoning
chains extend, LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic, progressively losing
grounding in the underlying visual information. This leads to reasoning paths
that diverge from the image content, culminating in erroneous conclusions. To
address this, we introduce a strikingly simple yet effective training-free
visual-reasoning pipeline. The core concept is to decouple the reasoning and
perception processes. A powerful LLM orchestrates the high-level reasoning,
strategically interrogating a LMM to extract specific visual information
required for its logical chain. The LMM, in turn, functions exclusively as a
visual question-answering engine, supplying the necessary perceptual details on
demand. This lightweight, plug-and-play approach requires no additional
training or architectural changes. Comprehensive evaluations validate that our
framework effectively governs the visual reasoning process, leading to a
significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and a substantial
improvement in reasoning fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP) is a replay-free framework for multi-label class-incremental learning that addresses semantic confusion and partial labeling issues through class-specific prompts and progressive confidence decoupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-based methods work well for single-label incremental learning but perform poorly in multi-label scenarios due to semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and true-negative-false-positive confusion from partial labeling.

Method: DDP uses class-specific positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and Progressive Confidence Decoupling (PCD) to suppress false positives. It freezes past prompts as knowledge anchors and uses interlayer prompting for efficiency.

Result: DDP consistently outperforms prior methods on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, becoming the first replay-free MLCIL approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10 benchmark.

Conclusion: DDP effectively addresses the key challenges in multi-label class-incremental learning through its dual-decoupled prompting strategy, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring replay mechanisms.

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have shown strong effectiveness in single-label
class-incremental learning, but their direct extension to multi-label
class-incremental learning (MLCIL) performs poorly due to two intrinsic
challenges: semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and
true-negative-false-positive confusion caused by partial labeling. We propose
Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework
that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific
positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive
Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that
suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and
interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP
consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL
approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LRPO is the first online RL framework for Blind Face Restoration that uses likelihood regularization to improve restoration quality while maintaining fidelity to ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blind Face Restoration faces challenges with large solution space, leading to artifacts like missing details and identity ambiguity in restored images.

Method: Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) with composite reward function, ground-truth guided likelihood regularization, and noise-level advantage assignment.

Result: Significantly improves face restoration quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: LRPO effectively balances perceptual quality and fidelity in face restoration through reinforcement learning with proper regularization strategies.

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration (BFR) encounters inherent challenges in exploring its
large solution space, leading to common artifacts like missing details and
identity ambiguity in the restored images. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) framework, the
first to apply online reinforcement learning (RL) to the BFR task. LRPO
leverages rewards from sampled candidates to refine the policy network,
increasing the likelihood of high-quality outputs while improving restoration
performance on low-quality inputs. However, directly applying RL to BFR creates
incompatibility issues, producing restoration results that deviate
significantly from the ground truth. To balance perceptual quality and
fidelity, we propose three key strategies: 1) a composite reward function
tailored for face restoration assessment, 2) ground-truth guided likelihood
regularization, and 3) noise-level advantage assignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed LRPO significantly improves the face restoration
quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: DentVLM establishes as a robust clinical decision support tool that can enhance primary dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to specialized medical expertise in dentistry.

Abstract: Diagnosing and managing oral diseases necessitate advanced visual
interpretation across diverse imaging modalities and integrated information
synthesis. While current AI models excel at isolated tasks, they often fall
short in addressing the complex, multimodal requirements of comprehensive
clinical dental practice. Here we introduce DentVLM, a multimodal
vision-language model engineered for expert-level oral disease diagnosis.
DentVLM was developed using a comprehensive, large-scale, bilingual dataset of
110,447 images and 2.46 million visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. The
model is capable of interpreting seven 2D oral imaging modalities across 36
diagnostic tasks, significantly outperforming leading proprietary and
open-source models by 19.6% higher accuracy for oral diseases and 27.9% for
malocclusions. In a clinical study involving 25 dentists, evaluating 1,946
patients and encompassing 3,105 QA pairs, DentVLM surpassed the diagnostic
performance of 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded that of 12
senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into a collaborative
workflow, DentVLM elevated junior dentists' performance to senior levels and
reduced diagnostic time for all practitioners by 15-22%. Furthermore, DentVLM
exhibited promising performance across three practical utility scenarios,
including home-based dental health management, hospital-based intelligent
diagnosis and multi-agent collaborative interaction. These findings establish

TL;DR: Dynamic-TreeRPO with LayerTuning-RL combines tree-structured sampling and reinforcement learning to improve text-to-image generation by enhancing exploration efficiency and quality without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-enhanced flow matching models for text-to-image generation suffer from exhaustive exploration and inefficient sampling due to slight variations in sampling groups, leading to computational inefficiency.

Method: Proposes Dynamic-TreeRPO with sliding-window tree-structured search using dynamic noise intensities, GRPO-guided optimization, constrained SDE sampling, and LayerTuning-RL that integrates SFT and RL with dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model and adaptive clipping bounds.

Result: Significant improvements in semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and human preference alignment on HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward benchmarks, outperforming SoTA by 4.9%, 5.91%, and 8.66% respectively, while improving training efficiency by nearly 50%.

Conclusion: The tree-structured sampling and LayerTuning-RL paradigm enable dynamic exploration of diverse search spaces along effective directions, achieving superior performance and efficiency in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for
text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation
quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration
and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling
group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements
the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic
noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and
constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree
structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively
amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed
noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the
variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we
seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within
Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the
loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM)
rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM
with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in
Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and
the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search
space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach
demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual
fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including
HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA
by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while
improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.

### [82] [Test-time Uncertainty Estimation for Medical Image Registration via Transformation Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23355)
*Lin Tian,Xiaoling Hu,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A test-time uncertainty estimation framework for image registration that works with any pretrained network by analyzing prediction variance under spatial perturbations, decomposing uncertainty into intrinsic spread and bias jitter components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep registration networks lack reliability indicators, and existing uncertainty methods require architectural changes or retraining, limiting their use with pretrained networks.

Method: Leverages transformation equivariance property by applying spatial perturbations to inputs and analyzing prediction variance, with theoretical decomposition into intrinsic spread (epistemic noise) and bias jitter (systematic error drift).

Result: Across four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, lung) and multiple registration models, uncertainty maps consistently correlate with registration errors and identify regions requiring caution.

Conclusion: The framework enables any pretrained registration network to become risk-aware at test time, advancing toward safe deployment in clinical and research settings.

Abstract: Accurate image registration is essential for downstream applications, yet
current deep registration networks provide limited indications of whether and
when their predictions are reliable. Existing uncertainty estimation
strategies, such as Bayesian methods, ensembles, or MC dropout, require
architectural changes or retraining, limiting their applicability to pretrained
registration networks. Instead, we propose a test-time uncertainty estimation
framework that is compatible with any pretrained networks. Our framework is
grounded in the transformation equivariance property of registration, which
states that the true mapping between two images should remain consistent under
spatial perturbations of the input. By analyzing the variance of network
predictions under such perturbations, we derive a theoretical decomposition of
perturbation-based uncertainty in registration. This decomposition separates
into two terms: (i) an intrinsic spread, reflecting epistemic noise, and (ii) a
bias jitter, capturing how systematic error drifts under perturbations. Across
four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, and lung) and multiple
registration models (uniGradICON, SynthMorph), the uncertainty maps correlate
consistently with registration errors and highlight regions requiring caution.
Our framework turns any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool
at test time, placing medical image registration one step closer to safe
deployment in clinical and large-scale research settings.

*Zhaohua Zhang,Jianhuan Zhuo,Muxi Chen,Chenchen Zhao,Wenyu Jiang,Tianwen Jiang,Mingyang Chen,Yu Tang,Qiuyong Xiao,Jihong Zhang,Zhixun Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAPE is a plug-and-play enhancement that uses ranking-aware policy optimization to improve CLIP-based retrieval under distribution shifts like multilingual, long-form, and multimodal differences, achieving 4.9% average improvement in Recall@10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with distribution shifts in retrieval tasks (multilingual, long-form, multimodal) and existing query-rewriting methods with LLMs lack supervision signals to generate optimal queries aligned with the retriever's training distribution.

Method: GRAPE incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided query rewriting using Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization (GRPO), with a corpus-relative ranking-based reward to address score inflation issues from naive similarity score finetuning.

Result: GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance across various distribution shifts - multilingual (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600), length differences (Wikipedia), and multimodal differences (CIRR) - with average 4.9% improvement in Recall@10.

Conclusion: GRAPE effectively bridges distributional gaps in CLIP-based retrieval systems through ranking-aware query rewriting, demonstrating significant performance improvements across diverse distribution shift scenarios without requiring costly retraining.

Abstract: The CLIP model has become a cornerstone of large-scale retrieval systems by
aligning text and image data in a unified embedding space. Despite its
simplicity and efficiency, CLIP struggles when applied to tasks whose input
distributions diverge from its training corpus, such as queries with
multilingual, long-form, or multimodal differences. To avoid costly retraining,
existing methods mainly adopt query-rewriting strategies with large language
models (LLMs), aiming to mitigate distribution gaps at the query level.
However, due to the lack of supervision signals, LLMs fail to generate the
optimal one that fits the training distribution. We address this challenge with
GRAPE (Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization Enhancement), a plug-and-play
enhancement approach that incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided
query rewriting with LLMs. Intuitively, GRAPE proposes to leverage GRPO to
bridge distributional differences -- including length, multilingual, and
modality shifts -- by transforming queries into forms better aligned with the
retriever's training distribution. However, our preliminary experiment finds
that naively finetuning LLM with similarity scores can lead to score inflation,
where nearly all candidates are assigned unexpectedly high scores regardless of
their true relevance. To address score inflation, we propose a corpus-relative
ranking-based reward, which explicitly aligns optimization with ranking metrics
while suppressing spurious score inflation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under distributional
shifts -- including multilingual differences (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600),
length differences (Wikipedia), and multimodal differences (CIRR) -- achieving
an average improvement of 4.9\% in Recall\@10. The code is available at

*Yifan Yang,Yuxiang Yan,Boda Liu,Jian Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CasPoinTr is a point cloud completion framework using cascaded networks and knowledge distillation to address incomplete point clouds from real-world environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds from real-world environments are often incomplete due to limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions, and noise, making completion essential for various applications.

Method: Uses cascaded networks with two stages: Shape Reconstruction (generates auxiliary information) and Fused Completion (leverages information with knowledge distillation). A teacher model trained on denser point clouds transfers knowledge to student model.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings in shape recovery and detail preservation.

Conclusion: The cascaded structure and distillation strategy effectively bridge the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets by capturing global shape context while refining local details.

Abstract: Point clouds collected from real-world environments are often incomplete due
to factors such as limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions,
and noise. These challenges make point cloud completion essential for various
applications. A key difficulty in this task is predicting the overall shape and
reconstructing missing regions from highly incomplete point clouds. To address
this, we introduce CasPoinTr, a novel point cloud completion framework using
cascaded networks and knowledge distillation. CasPoinTr decomposes the
completion task into two synergistic stages: Shape Reconstruction, which
generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion, which leverages this
information alongside knowledge distillation to generate the final output.
Through knowledge distillation, a teacher model trained on denser point clouds
transfers incomplete-complete associative knowledge to the student model,
enhancing its ability to estimate the overall shape and predict missing
regions. Together, the cascaded networks and knowledge distillation enhance the
model's ability to capture global shape context while refining local details,
effectively bridging the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets.
Experiments on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings demonstrate that
CasPoinTr outperforms existing methods in shape recovery and detail
preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our cascaded structure and
distillation strategy.

*Jinghong Zheng,Changlong Jiang,Jiaqi Li,Haohong Kuang,Hang Xu,Tingbing Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPose is a unified cross-modality method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation that transfers 2D pose annotations to 3D using RGB-D sequences without requiring 3D keypoint annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations in 3D human pose estimation by leveraging easily acquired RGB-D sequences and bridging the gap between 2D and 3D domains without multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data shifts.

Method: Uses self-supervised learning on RGB-D sequences to transfer 2D pose annotations from RGB datasets to 3D domain. Leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as weak supervision for point cloud networks with spatial-temporal constraints, 2D-to-3D back-projection loss, and cross-modality interaction. Uses anchor-to-joint prediction for 3D lifting on RGB and depth networks.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets. Performance improves with large-scale unlabeled data (NTU RGB+D 60) under challenging conditions. The proposed 3D lifting method achieves state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: UniPose demonstrates strong potential for practical 3D human pose estimation applications by effectively using weakly supervised learning with RGB-D data, eliminating the need for expensive 3D annotations while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we present UniPose, a unified cross-modality pose prior
propagation method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using
unannotated single-view RGB-D sequences (RGB, depth, and point cloud data).
UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS
COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D
sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations.
This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from
issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data
shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as
weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal
constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection
loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating
the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our
anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth
networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared
to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show
that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods.
Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its
performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for
practical applications. Our proposed 3D lifting method also achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Goliath-SC, the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape registration, and proposes a generative model for self-contact poses conditioned on body shape parameters using latent diffusion with self-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-contact datasets lack variety of poses and precise body shapes, limiting analysis of the relationship between self-contact poses and body shapes. Body shape affects self-contact (e.g., hand penetration in belly rubbing differs by BMI).

Method: Created Goliath-SC dataset with 383K self-contact poses across 130 subjects. Proposed body-part-wise latent diffusion with self-attention for generative modeling of self-contact prior conditioned by body shape parameters. Incorporated this prior into single-view human pose estimation with contact refinement.

Result: Shape conditioning proved vital for successfully modeling self-contact pose distribution. The approach improved single-view pose estimation in self-contact scenarios.

Conclusion: Body shape conditioning is essential for accurate self-contact modeling and improves pose estimation performance in self-contact situations.

Abstract: One can hardly model self-contact of human poses without considering
underlying body shapes. For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person
with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person
with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the
variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive
analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by
introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape
registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130
subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact
prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent
diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into
single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in
contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the
successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving
single-view pose estimation in self-contact.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldSplat is a feed-forward framework for generating 4D driving scenes that combines generation and reconstruction capabilities to produce consistent multi-track novel-view videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either focus on diverse driving video generation but lack 3D consistency for novel-view synthesis, or excel at 3D/4D reconstruction but lack generative capabilities. This creates a gap between generation and reconstruction that needs to be addressed.

Method: Uses a 4D-aware latent diffusion model with multi-modal information to generate pixel-aligned 4D Gaussians in feed-forward manner, then refines the rendered novel-view videos using an enhanced video diffusion model.

Result: Effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos as demonstrated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: WorldSplat successfully bridges the gap between driving-scene generation and reconstruction, enabling convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis while maintaining generative capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have
demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by
producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods
primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos;
however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they
struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS).
Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved
NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities.
To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we
propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D
driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent
multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent
diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D
Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel
view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion
model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
\textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and
spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

*Sahithya Ravi,Aditya Chinchure,Raymond T. Ng,Leonid Sigal,Vered Shwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPIKE is an inference-time framework that uses Bayesian Surprise to identify memorable moments in videos and guides frame sampling to focus on these critical events, improving Video-LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most Video-LLMs process videos with uniform frame sampling, which often misses critical moments that define a video's narrative, particularly surprising or memorable events.

Method: SPIKE quantifies Bayesian Surprise as belief updates triggered by new visual evidence, identifying moments where evidence conflicts with prior beliefs. SPIKE-RL uses GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on reward signals from video captions.

Result: SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, correlating strongly with human judgment on surprise benchmarks. Surprise-weighted frame sampling achieves consistent performance gains on five downstream benchmarks over uniform sampling.

Conclusion: By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and register surprise, the framework paves the way for more robust models that can revise their understanding in response to new information.

Abstract: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable,
surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames
uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We
introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise
as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream,
identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs.
SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans
on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs
of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which
leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the
video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame
sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With
this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream
benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and
register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can
revise their understanding in response to new information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing periodic activation-based INR networks like SIREN and FINER suffer from hidden feature redundancy due to fixed frequency multipliers, limiting MLP expressive capacity and causing neurons to capture overlapping frequency components.

Method: Proposed FM-SIREN and FM-FINER with Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency multipliers for periodic activations, introducing frequency diversity without hyperparameter tuning or additional network depth.

Result: Reduces feature redundancy by nearly 50%, consistently improves signal reconstruction across 1D audio, 2D image, 3D shape fitting, and NeRF synthesis, outperforming baseline counterparts while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The simple yet principled modification of neuron-specific frequency multipliers effectively addresses feature redundancy in periodic activation-based INRs, enhancing performance across diverse tasks without increasing complexity.

Abstract: Existing periodic activation-based implicit neural representation (INR)
networks, such as SIREN and FINER, suffer from hidden feature redundancy, where
neurons within a layer capture overlapping frequency components due to the use
of a fixed frequency multiplier. This redundancy limits the expressive capacity
of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Drawing inspiration from classical signal
processing methods such as the Discrete Sine Transform (DST), we propose
FM-SIREN and FM-FINER, which assign Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency
multipliers to periodic activations. Unlike existing approaches, our design
introduces frequency diversity without requiring hyperparameter tuning or
additional network depth. This simple yet principled modification reduces the
redundancy of features by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal
reconstruction across diverse INR tasks, including fitting 1D audio, 2D image
and 3D shape, and synthesis of neural radiance fields (NeRF), outperforming
their baseline counterparts while maintaining efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoR-SALE is a framework that improves text-to-image generation by incorporating Frame of Reference concepts to better handle spatial descriptions from different perspectives, using vision modules and latent-space operations to correct misalignments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with spatial descriptions from perspectives other than the camera view, creating a need to integrate Frame of Reference concepts for better spatial reasoning.

Method: Extends SLD framework by evaluating text-image alignment using Frame of Reference, extracts spatial configuration from images, maps spatial expressions to camera perspectives, and applies latent-space operations to adjust facing direction and depth.

Result: Improves state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3% on spatial understanding benchmarks using only a single correction round.

Conclusion: FoR-SALE successfully integrates Frame of Reference into multimodal models, significantly enhancing their ability to handle complex spatial descriptions from various viewpoints.

Abstract: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that
humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in
Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this
long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image
(T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant
performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other
than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of
Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE),
an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework
for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially
generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference
specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the
spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial
expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective
enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When
misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and
applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing
direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two
benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our
framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3%
using only a single round of correction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DPCNet is a compact module that rectifies monocular 3D poses into a consistent body-centered frame using a hybrid encoder with graph convolutions and transformers, trained self-supervised to reduce rotation errors from 20° to 3.4°.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce view-dependent signals that complicate comparative analysis in applications like health and sports science, requiring consistent body-centered representations.

Method: Uses a hybrid encoder fusing local skeletal features from graph convolutional networks with global context from transformers via gated cross-attention, predicting continuous 6D rotation mapped to SO(3) matrix for pose alignment.

Result: Reduces mean rotation error from over 20° to 3.4° and Mean Per Joint Position Error from ~64 mm to 47 mm on MM-Fi benchmark, with qualitative evaluations showing strong correspondence to ground-truth IMU data.

Conclusion: The method effectively removes viewpoint variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis, producing acceleration signals from video that align well with sensor data.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons, creating
view-dependent kinematic signals that complicate comparative analysis in
applications such as health and sports science. We present 3DPCNet, a compact,
estimator-agnostic module that operates directly on 3D joint coordinates to
rectify any input pose into a consistent, body-centered canonical frame. Its
hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network
with global context from a transformer via a gated cross-attention mechanism.
From this representation, the model predicts a continuous 6D rotation that is
mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix to align the pose. We train the model in a
self-supervised manner on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses,
guided by a composite loss ensuring both accurate rotation and pose
reconstruction. On the MM-Fi benchmark, 3DPCNet reduces the mean rotation error
from over 20$^{\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\circ}$ and the Mean Per Joint Position Error
from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluations
on the TotalCapture dataset further demonstrate that our method produces
acceleration signals from video that show strong visual correspondence to
ground-truth IMU sensor data, confirming that our module removes viewpoint
variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fine-grained test-time optimization framework that improves compositional faithfulness in text-to-image generation by decomposing prompts into semantic concepts and using concept-level feedback for iterative prompt refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models often fail to faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization approaches typically rely only on global image/text similarity, which is insufficient for complex compositional prompts.

Method: Decomposes input prompts into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both global and concept levels using a fine-grained CLIP variant. The concept-level feedback on missing/inaccurate concepts is used in an iterative prompt refinement loop with a large language model to generate improved prompts.

Result: Experiments on DrawBench and CompBench prompts show significant improvements in concept coverage and human-judged faithfulness compared to standard test-time optimization and base T2I models.

Conclusion: The proposed fine-grained test-time optimization framework effectively enhances compositional faithfulness in text-to-image generation by addressing concept-level alignment through iterative prompt refinement.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, they often fail to
faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or
misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization has
emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation by refining
generation without the need for retraining. In this paper, we propose a
fine-grained test-time optimization framework that enhances compositional
faithfulness in T2I generation. Unlike most of prior approaches that rely
solely on a global image/text similarity score, our method decomposes the input
prompt into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both the global and
concept levels. A fine-grained variant of CLIP is used to compute concept-level
correspondence, producing detailed feedback on missing or inaccurate concepts.
This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the
large language model to propose improved prompts. Experiments on DrawBench and
CompBench prompts demonstrate that our method significantly improves concept
coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time
optimization and the base T2I model. Code is available at:

*Ming-Tsung Hsu,Fang-Yu Hsu,Yi-Ting Lin,Kai-Heng Chien,Jun-Ren Chen,Cheng-Hsiang Su,Yi-Chen Ou,Chiou-Ting Hsu,Pei-Kai Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MFAS-DANet is a novel framework for multi-modal face anti-spoofing under domain adaptation, addressing missing modalities, noisy pseudo labels, and model degradation through complementary feature extraction, uncertainty-based pseudo labeling, and adaptive loss weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal FAS models fail to detect unseen attacks from new domains, and domain adaptation remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS despite being addressed in single-modal approaches.

Method: Proposes three key techniques: 1) Complementary feature extraction to handle missing modalities, 2) Uncertainty-based pseudo labeling to reduce noise, 3) Adaptive loss weighting mechanism to prevent model degradation during unstable adaptations.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and effectiveness of MFAS-DANet in multi-modal FAS domain adaptation scenarios.

Conclusion: MFAS-DANet successfully addresses the three major challenges in multi-modal FAS domain adaptation and achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have investigated the
potential of leveraging multiple modalities to distinguish live and spoof
faces. However, pre-adapted multi-modal FAS models often fail to detect unseen
attacks from new target domains. Although a more realistic domain adaptation
(DA) scenario has been proposed for single-modal FAS to learn specific spoof
attacks during inference, DA remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS methods. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, MFAS-DANet, to address three major
challenges in multi-modal FAS under the DA scenario: missing modalities, noisy
pseudo labels, and model degradation. First, to tackle the issue of missing
modalities, we propose extracting complementary features from other modalities
to substitute missing modality features or enhance existing ones. Next, to
reduce the impact of noisy pseudo labels during model adaptation, we propose
deriving reliable pseudo labels by leveraging prediction uncertainty across
different modalities. Finally, to prevent model degradation, we design an
adaptive mechanism that decreases the loss weight during unstable adaptations
and increasing it during stable ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MFAS-DANet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RestoRect is a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method that addresses the speed-quality trade-off in image restoration by using rectified flow to enable students to synthesize teacher-quality features through learnable latent trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image restoration approaches face a critical trade-off where high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast models produce poor results. Existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features.

Method: Proposes RestoRect using rectified flow to reformulate feature distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints and trigonometric color space polarization. Introduces Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection.

Conclusion: The proposed RestoRect method successfully addresses the speed-quality trade-off in image restoration through novel latent rectified flow feature distillation, enabling fast inference while maintaining high restoration quality.

Abstract: Current approaches for restoration of degraded images face a critical
trade-off: high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast
models produce poor results. Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge
to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how
modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose
'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for
restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature
distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize
teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our
framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with
learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space
polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS) is a novel 4D reconstruction framework that uses scene orientation as stable guidance to model complex dynamic deformations from monocular videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods that extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes rely on low-rank assumptions and struggle to model complex, region-specific deformations in unconstrained dynamic scenes.

Method: Estimates a Global Orientation Field to propagate principal directions across space and time, then introduces Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian that embeds time, space, geometry, and orientation into a unified probabilistic state for inferring region-specific deformations.

Result: Experiments show superior reconstruction fidelity over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: OriGS effectively addresses complex dynamic modeling by leveraging orientation-based guidance and unified probabilistic representation for high-quality 4D reconstruction.

Abstract: We present Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS), a novel framework
for high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos.
While recent advances extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via
various motion anchors, such as graph nodes or spline control points, they
often rely on low-rank assumptions and fall short in modeling complex,
region-specific deformations inherent to unconstrained dynamics. OriGS
addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in
scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates
principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable
structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose
Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time,
space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state. This
enables inferring region-specific deformation through principled conditioned
slicing, adaptively capturing diverse local dynamics in alignment with global
motion intent. Experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction fidelity of
OriGS over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

*Divyam Madaan,Varshan Muhunthan,Kyunghyun Cho,Sumit Chopra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Large-scale study reveals that multi-modal benchmarks often over-rely on single modalities rather than true multi-modal reasoning, with many benchmarks amplifying image-only dependencies instead of mitigating text-only biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (individual modality contributions) and inter-modality dependencies (relationships between modalities and target task) in multi-modal learning, as current benchmark evaluations poorly characterize these interactions.

Method: Conducted large-scale empirical study across 23 visual question-answering benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), covering domains including general/expert knowledge reasoning, OCR, and document understanding.

Result: Found significant variation in reliance on vision, text, and their interaction across and within benchmarks. Many benchmarks intended to mitigate text-only biases actually amplified image-only dependencies. Larger models often use intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that masks lack of true multi-modal reasoning.

Conclusion: Provides quantitative characterization of multi-modal datasets, enabling principled approach to multi-modal benchmark design and evaluation by revealing current limitations in measuring genuine multi-modal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the
contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality
dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is
fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and
interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations
remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical
study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering
benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains
such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition,
and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision,
question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and
within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate
text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This
characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these
intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying
lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of
multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark
design and evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polyp segmentation is challenging due to diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast boundaries in medical imaging, requiring improved accuracy and efficiency for colorectal cancer detection.

Method: Combines Dynamic Kernel mechanism initialized by global context from Encoder Attention module with Unified Channel Adaptation in decoder for standardized feature dimensions and efficient information fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB datasets with superior Dice and IoU scores, while reducing computational costs without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Provides a robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation with promising applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is a critical step in colorectal cancer detection, yet it
remains challenging due to the diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast
boundaries of polyps in medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel
framework that improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency by integrating a
Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism with a global Encoder Attention module. The DK
mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module,
iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, enabling
the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA
module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by
aggregating multi scale information from all encoder layers. In addition, we
employ Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature
dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient
information fusion. Our approach extends the lesion-aware kernel framework by
introducing a more flexible, attention driven kernel initialization and a
unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state of the
art segmentation methods, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union
scores. Moreover, UCA simplifies the decoder structure, reducing computational
cost without compromising accuracy. Overall, the proposed method provides a
robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with promising
applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues like point-light displays, which isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning. This ability emerges early in development and is attributed to human embodied experience, making PLDs ideal for testing action understanding constraints in AI systems.

Method: The researchers introduced ActPLD benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs using both single-actor and socially interacting point-light displays. They tested state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models on this novel benchmark.

Result: The results revealed consistently low performance across all tested models, demonstrating fundamental gaps in action understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities in current MLLMs.

Conclusion: Current multimodal large language models show significant limitations in processing human actions from minimal visual cues like point-light displays, highlighting fundamental gaps in their action and spatiotemporal understanding capabilities compared to human cognition.

Abstract: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues, as
demonstrated by point-light displays (PLDs), which consist of sparse sets of
dots localized to key joints of the human body. This ability emerges early in
development and is largely attributed to human embodied experience. Since PLDs
isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning, they represent key stimuli
for testing the constraints of action understanding in these systems. Here we
introduce ActPLD, the first benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs
from human PLDs. Tested models include state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source systems on single-actor and socially interacting PLDs. Our results
reveal consistently low performance across models, introducing fundamental gaps

TL;DR: This study develops a deep learning framework using chest CT scans to predict mortality in systemic sclerosis patients with interstitial lung disease, achieving AUCs of 0.769, 0.801, and 0.709 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality prediction respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interstitial lung disease is a major cause of death in systemic sclerosis patients, but the role of CT imaging in predicting disease progression and mortality hasn't been fully established. There's a need for better early detection and risk assessment methods.

Method: Used a large-scale longitudinal analysis of 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients. Applied radiomics and deep learning with pre-trained models (ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer) fine-tuned on the dataset. Conducted mortality analysis at 1-, 3-, and 5-year intervals with death labels confirmed by physicians.

Result: The models achieved AUCs of 0.769 for 1-year mortality, 0.801 for 3-year mortality, and 0.709 for 5-year mortality prediction. The dataset included 181, 326, and 428 deaths within 1, 3, and 5 years respectively.

Conclusion: Both radiomics and deep learning methods show strong potential for improving early detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, representing a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Chest computed tomography (CT) is the primary
imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring lung complications in SSc
patients. However, its role in disease progression and mortality prediction has
not yet been fully clarified. This study introduces a novel, large-scale
longitudinal chest CT analysis framework that utilizes radiomics and deep
learning to predict mortality associated with lung complications of SSc. We
collected and analyzed 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients enrolled in the
Northwestern Scleroderma Registry, conducting mortality analyses at one, three,
and five years using advanced imaging analysis techniques. Death labels were
assigned based on recorded deaths over the one-, three-, and five-year
intervals, confirmed by expert physicians. In our dataset, 181, 326, and 428 of
the 2,125 CT scans were from patients who died within one, three, and five
years, respectively. Using ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and Swin Transformer we use
pre-trained models, and fine-tuned on 2,125 images of SSc patients. Models
achieved an AUC of 0.769, 0.801, 0.709 for predicting mortality within one-,
three-, and five-years, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of
both radiomics and deep learning computational methods to improve early

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver monitoring systems need reliable confidence scores for safety-critical deployment. Direct low-resolution training yields high accuracy but poor calibration, which is dangerous in safety-critical scenarios.

Method: Resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework that optimizes for model calibration and high precision-recall on critical events, with a lightweight artifact detector to filter SR-induced hallucinations.

Result: State-of-the-art performance: best calibration (ECE 5.8% vs 6.2% baseline), highest AUPR for drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), superior precision-recall for phone use detection (0.74 vs 0.71), with minimal overhead (0.3M parameters, 5.2ms).

Conclusion: While LR-trained models serve as strong baselines, the adaptive framework represents state-of-the-art for safety-critical applications where reliability is paramount.

Abstract: Driver monitoring systems require not just high accuracy but reliable,
well-calibrated confidence scores for safety-critical deployment. While direct
low-resolution training yields high overall accuracy, it produces poorly
calibrated predictions that can be dangerous in safety-critical scenarios. We
propose a resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework that optimizes for
model calibration and high precision-recall on critical events. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on safety-centric metrics: best
calibration (ECE of 5.8\% vs 6.2\% for LR-trained baselines), highest AUPR for
drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), and superior precision-recall for phone
use detection (0.74 vs 0.71). A lightweight artifact detector (0.3M parameters,
5.2ms overhead) provides additional safety by filtering SR-induced

*Hongyang Li,Jinyuan Qu,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OVSeg3R is a training scheme that learns open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from 2D perception models using 3D reconstruction, achieving significant performance improvements on ScanNet200 benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without costly manual annotation by leveraging existing 2D perception models and 3D reconstruction techniques.

Method: Projects 2D instance masks from open-vocabulary 2D models onto 3D scenes using reconstruction correspondences, uses View-wise Instance Partition to avoid false positives, and employs 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint clustering to preserve instance boundaries.

Result: Achieves +2.3 mAP overall improvement on ScanNet200 benchmark and +7.1 mAP improvement on novel classes under open-vocabulary setting compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: OVSeg3R effectively bridges 2D and 3D perception, enabling robust open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation while substantially reducing performance gap between tail and head classes.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training scheme called OVSeg3R to learn
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from well-studied 2D perception models
with the aid of 3D reconstruction. OVSeg3R directly adopts reconstructed scenes
from 2D videos as input, avoiding costly manual adjustment while aligning input
with real-world applications. By exploiting the 2D to 3D correspondences
provided by 3D reconstruction models, OVSeg3R projects each view's 2D instance
mask predictions, obtained from an open-vocabulary 2D model, onto 3D to
generate annotations for the view's corresponding sub-scene. To avoid
incorrectly introduced false positives as supervision due to partial
annotations from 2D to 3D, we propose a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm,
which partitions predictions to their respective views for supervision,
stabilizing the training process. Furthermore, since 3D reconstruction models
tend to over-smooth geometric details, clustering reconstructed points into
representative super-points based solely on geometry, as commonly done in
mainstream 3D segmentation methods, may overlook geometrically non-salient
objects. We therefore introduce 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint, which
leverages 2D masks to constrain the superpoint clustering, preventing
superpoints from violating instance boundaries. With these designs, OVSeg3R not
only extends a state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation
model to open-vocabulary, but also substantially narrows the performance gap
between tail and head classes, ultimately leading to an overall improvement of
+2.3 mAP on the ScanNet200 benchmark. Furthermore, under the standard
open-vocabulary setting, OVSeg3R surpasses previous methods by about +7.1 mAP
on the novel classes, further validating its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why 3DGS is increasingly replacing NeRF-based methods and how it adapts to different domains with common goals of photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream tasks.

Method: Systematic review and comparison of domain-specific pipelines using 3DGS across various applications, organized around unified research questions about technical advantages, adaptation to input modalities, and remaining limitations.

Result: 3DGS balances photorealism, geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency better than NeRF-based approaches, making it suitable for perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual environments.

Conclusion: 3DGS offers a roadmap for leveraging neural rendering not only for image synthesis but also for broader applications in perception, interaction, and content creation, positioning it as a superior alternative to NeRF in many domains.

Abstract: Neural scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have transformed how 3D environments are modeled,
rendered, and interpreted. NeRF introduced view-consistent photorealism via
volumetric rendering; 3DGS has rapidly emerged as an explicit, efficient
alternative that supports high-quality rendering, faster optimization, and
integration into hybrid pipelines for enhanced photorealism and task-driven
scene understanding. This survey examines how 3DGS is being adopted across
SLAM, telepresence and teleoperation, robotic manipulation, and 3D content
generation. Despite their differences, these domains share common goals:
photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream
tasks. We organize the review around unified research questions that explain
why 3DGS is increasingly displacing NeRF-based approaches: What technical
advantages drive its adoption? How does it adapt to different input modalities
and domain-specific constraints? What limitations remain? By systematically
comparing domain-specific pipelines, we show that 3DGS balances photorealism,
geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency. The survey offers a roadmap
for leveraging neural rendering not only for image synthesis but also for
perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreatic diseases show regional heterogeneity (cancers in head, chronic pancreatitis in tail), requiring accurate part segmentation for diagnosis and treatment. Challenges include variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast in MRI, and data scarcity.

Method: Privacy-preserving FL framework with three segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net, Swin UNETR) and two FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx). Novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture contrasts in MRI.

Result: Attention U-Net with FedAvg identified as optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity. Approach achieves clinically viable performance despite training on distributed, heterogeneous datasets.

Conclusion: Successfully demonstrates federated learning for pancreas part segmentation in MRI, overcoming data scarcity and privacy concerns while achieving clinically useful results.

Abstract: We present the first federated learning (FL) approach for pancreas part(head,
body and tail) segmentation in MRI, addressing a critical clinical challenge as
a significant innovation. Pancreatic diseases exhibit marked regional
heterogeneity cancers predominantly occur in the head region while chronic
pancreatitis causes tissue loss in the tail, making accurate segmentation of
the organ into head, body, and tail regions essential for precise diagnosis and
treatment planning. This segmentation task remains exceptionally challenging in
MRI due to variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast, and anatomical
variations across patients. Our novel contribution tackles two fundamental
challenges: first, the technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in
MRI, and second the data scarcity problem that has hindered prior approaches.
We introduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that enables collaborative model
training across seven medical institutions without direct data sharing,
leveraging a diverse dataset of 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans. Our key
innovations include: (1) a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art
segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net,Swin UNETR) paired with two
FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), revealing Attention U-Net with FedAvg as
optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, which was never been done before; (2) a
novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture
contrasts in MRI. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach
achieves clinically viable performance despite training on distributed,
heterogeneous datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches mask contributions from different brain areas by using intermediate image/text feature spaces, limiting understanding of how brain signals shape visual reconstruction.

Method: Directly conditions latent diffusion models on brain representations, bypassing intermediate feature spaces, and uses an Image-Brain BI-directional interpretability framework (IBBI) to analyze cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion steps.

Result: Demonstrates competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets while providing greater transparency into how brain signals influence the generation process.

Conclusion: Shows potential for end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and establishes a path toward interpreting diffusion models through visual neuroscience, revealing how different cortical areas influence the generative trajectory.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that complex visual stimuli can be decoded from
human brain activity using deep generative models, helping brain science
researchers interpret how the brain represents real-world scenes. However, most
current approaches leverage mapping brain signals into intermediate image or
text feature spaces before guiding the generative process, masking the effect
of contributions from different brain areas on the final reconstruction output.
In this work, we propose NeuroAdapter, a visual decoding framework that
directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations,
bypassing the need for intermediate feature spaces. Our method demonstrates
competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to
prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape
the generation process. To this end, we contribute an Image-Brain
BI-directional interpretability framework (IBBI) which investigates
cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps to reveal how
different cortical areas influence the unfolding generative trajectory. Our
results highlight the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and
establish a path toward interpreting diffusion models through the lens of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobuQ is a systematic QAT framework for Diffusion Transformers that addresses activation quantization challenges through RobustQuantizer and AMPN, achieving state-of-the-art sub-4-bit quantization with competitive image generation on ImageNet-1K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) outperform U-Nets but face practical deployment challenges due to high computational and memory costs. Activation quantization is identified as the primary bottleneck for low-bit DiT quantization.

Method: Establishes ternary weight baseline (W1.58A4), proposes RobustQuantizer using Hadamard transform to normalize activation distributions, and introduces AMPN - an Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network that applies ternary weights globally while allocating different activation precisions per layer.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in sub-4-bit configurations. First to achieve stable and competitive image generation on ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits.

Conclusion: RobuQ successfully addresses activation quantization challenges in DiTs, enabling practical deployment through efficient sub-4-bit quantization while maintaining competitive image generation quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for image generation, demonstrating superior scalability and performance over
U-Net architectures. However, their practical deployment is hindered by
substantial computational and memory costs. While Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT) has shown promise for U-Nets, its application to DiTs faces unique
challenges, primarily due to the sensitivity and distributional complexity of
activations. In this work, we identify activation quantization as the primary
bottleneck for pushing DiTs to extremely low-bit settings. To address this, we
propose a systematic QAT framework for DiTs, named RobuQ. We start by
establishing a strong ternary weight (W1.58A4) DiT baseline. Building upon
this, we propose RobustQuantizer to achieve robust activation quantization. Our
theoretical analyses show that the Hadamard transform can convert unknown
per-token distributions into per-token normal distributions, providing a strong
foundation for this method. Furthermore, we propose AMPN, the first
Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network pipeline for DiTs. This method applies
ternary weights across the entire network while allocating different activation
precisions to each layer to eliminate information bottlenecks. Through
extensive experiments on unconditional and conditional image generation, our
RobuQ framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in
sub-4-bit quantization configuration. To the best of our knowledge, RobuQ is
the first achieving stable and competitive image generation on large datasets
like ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits. The code and
models will be available at https://github.com/racoonykc/RobuQ .

*Shulian Zhang,Yong Guo,Long Peng,Ziyang Wang,Ye Chen,Wenbo Li,Xiao Zhang,Yulun Zhang,Jian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VividFace is an efficient one-step diffusion framework for video face enhancement that addresses challenges in facial texture modeling, temporal consistency, model generalization, and inference efficiency through flow matching, joint latent-pixel training, and automated data curation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video face enhancement methods face three key challenges: difficulty in modeling intricate facial textures while maintaining temporal consistency, limited model generalization due to lack of high-quality training data, and low efficiency from repeated denoising steps during inference.

Method: Built on pretrained WANX video generation model, VividFace uses single-step flow matching for direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality outputs. It employs Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training with stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global reconstruction, and uses MLLM-driven data curation for automated dataset selection.

Result: Extensive experiments show VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while significantly reducing inference time compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: VividFace provides an efficient and effective solution for video face enhancement that overcomes fundamental challenges in the field, offering both superior performance and practical resources for the research community.

Abstract: Video Face Enhancement (VFE) seeks to reconstruct high-quality facial regions
from degraded video sequences, a capability that underpins numerous
applications including video conferencing, film restoration, and surveillance.
Despite substantial progress in the field, current methods that primarily rely
on video super-resolution and generative frameworks continue to face three
fundamental challenges: (1) faithfully modeling intricate facial textures while
preserving temporal consistency; (2) restricted model generalization due to the
lack of high-quality face video training data; and (3) low efficiency caused by
repeated denoising steps during inference. To address these challenges, we
propose VividFace, a novel and efficient one-step diffusion framework for video
face enhancement. Built upon the pretrained WANX video generation model, our
method leverages powerful spatiotemporal priors through a single-step flow
matching paradigm, enabling direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality
outputs with significantly reduced inference time. To further boost efficiency,
we propose a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy that employs
stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global
reconstruction, providing explicit supervision in both latent and pixel spaces
through a progressive two-stage training process. Additionally, we introduce an
MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality
video face datasets, enhancing model generalization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual
quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while offering
practical resources for the research community.

### [109] [Multi-Level Heterogeneous Knowledge Transfer Network on Forward Scattering Center Model for Limited Samples SAR ATR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23596)
*Chenxi Zhao,Daochang Wang,Siqian Zhang,Gangyao Kuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer network that uses forward scattering center models (FSCM) instead of simulated SAR images to transfer purer target knowledge for SAR target recognition with limited samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing simulated SAR image methods contain irrelevant information like background and noise that degrade knowledge transfer quality. FSCM provides purer target knowledge with strong physical meaning and interpretability.

Method: Multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network with three components: task-associated information selector (TAIS) for feature migration, target generic knowledge transfer (TGKT) with maximum discrimination divergence metric for distribution alignment, and category relation knowledge transfer (CRKT) for category-level consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on two new datasets combining FSCM data and measured SAR images demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively transfers purer FSCM knowledge through stepwise selection and migration, overcoming limitations of traditional simulated image approaches and achieving better SAR target recognition with limited samples.

Abstract: Simulated data-assisted SAR target recognition methods are the research
hotspot currently, devoted to solving the problem of limited samples. Existing
works revolve around simulated images, but the large amount of irrelevant
information embedded in the images, such as background, noise, etc., seriously
affects the quality of the migrated information. Our work explores a new
simulated data to migrate purer and key target knowledge, i.e., forward
scattering center model (FSCM) which models the actual local structure of the
target with strong physical meaning and interpretability. To achieve this
purpose, multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network is
proposed, which fully migrates FSCM knowledge from the feature, distribution
and category levels, respectively. Specifically, we permit the more suitable
feature representations for the heterogeneous data and separate non-informative
knowledge by task-associated information selector (TAIS), to complete purer
target feature migration. In the distribution alignment, the new metric
function maximum discrimination divergence (MDD) in target generic knowledge
transfer (TGKT) module perceives transferable knowledge efficiently while
preserving discriminative structure about classes. Moreover, category relation
knowledge transfer (CRKT) module leverages the category relation consistency
constraint to break the dilemma of optimization bias towards simulation data
due to imbalance between simulated and measured data. Such stepwise knowledge
selection and migration will ensure the integrity of the migrated FSCM
knowledge. Notably, extensive experiments on two new datasets formed by FSCM
data and measured SAR images demonstrate the superior performance of our
method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAMamba is a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework that improves image restoration through two innovations: QCLAM for efficient feature learning with dynamic memory reuse, and GPS-SS2D for adaptive scanning paths based on pixel importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mamba-based image restoration methods are limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization, which cannot adapt to diverse degradations and constrain both performance and computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes VAMamba with two key components: 1) QCLAM - a queue-based cache with low-rank adaptive memory that enables dynamic feature reuse while controlling memory growth, 2) GPS-SS2D - an adaptive scanning mechanism using Vision Transformer-generated score maps and greedy path selection for targeted feature extraction.

Result: Extensive experiments show VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches across diverse restoration tasks in both restoration quality and efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration.

Conclusion: VAMamba successfully addresses the limitations of fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization in Mamba-based methods, providing an adaptive framework that maintains high computational efficiency while achieving superior restoration performance.

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods have achieved promising results
but remain
  limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization.
Conventional Mamba
  architectures rely on predetermined paths that cannot adapt to diverse
degradations, constraining
  both restoration performance and computational efficiency. To overcome these
limitations, we
  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations.
First,
  QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha
  FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current
LoRA-adapted and
  cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while
effectively controlling
  memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning.
A
  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a
greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These
learned trajectories replace rigid
  patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The
integration of QCLAM and
  GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while
maintaining high
  computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration
tasks demonstrate
  that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration
quality and
  efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration. Our

TL;DR: Deep taxonomic networks use a hierarchical binary tree structure with variational inference to automatically discover taxonomic hierarchies and prototype clusters from unlabeled data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current deep hierarchical clustering methods that tie structure to class numbers and underutilize prototype information at intermediate levels, inspired by human ability to organize knowledge hierarchically.

Method: Deep latent variable approach with complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior in variational inference framework, optimizing ELBO to discover hierarchical relationships among prototypes without assuming true label sizes.

Result: Strong hierarchical clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image datasets using novel evaluation that leverages prototype clusters at all hierarchical levels.

Conclusion: The method discovers rich and interpretable hierarchical taxonomies that capture both coarse-grained semantic categories and fine-grained visual distinctions directly from unlabeled data.

Abstract: Inspired by the human ability to learn and organize knowledge into
hierarchical taxonomies with prototypes, this paper addresses key limitations
in current deep hierarchical clustering methods. Existing methods often tie the
structure to the number of classes and underutilize the rich prototype
information available at intermediate hierarchical levels. We introduce deep
taxonomic networks, a novel deep latent variable approach designed to bridge
these gaps. Our method optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy,
specifically a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within
a variational inference framework, to automatically discover taxonomic
structures and associated prototype clusters directly from unlabeled data
without assuming true label sizes. We analytically show that optimizing the
ELBO of our method encourages the discovery of hierarchical relationships among
prototypes. Empirically, our learned models demonstrate strong hierarchical
clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image
classification datasets using our novel evaluation mechanism that leverages
prototype clusters discovered at all hierarchical levels. Qualitative results
further reveal that deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable
hierarchical taxonomies, capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and
fine-grained visual distinctions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models provide superior quality for LDCT denoising but are computationally prohibitive for clinical use, with inference times exceeding thousands of seconds per scan.

Method: Uses a latent diffusion approach with a perceptually-optimized autoencoder to operate in compressed latent space, enabling fast deterministic conditional denoising with an attention-based conditional U-Net.

Result: Achieves superior perceptual quality over CNN/GAN methods and rivals reconstruction fidelity of heavy diffusion models like DDPM and Dn-Dp, while being 60x faster in inference while remaining competitive on PSNR/SSIM scores.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a practical path for advanced generative models in medical imaging by bridging the gap between high fidelity and clinical viability.

Abstract: While diffusion models have set a new benchmark for quality in Low-Dose
Computed Tomography (LDCT) denoising, their clinical adoption is critically
hindered by extreme computational costs, with inference times often exceeding
thousands of seconds per scan. To overcome this barrier, we introduce MAN, a
Latent Diffusion Enhanced Multistage Anti-Noise Network for Efficient and
High-Quality Low-Dose CT Image Denoising task. Our method operates in a
compressed latent space via a perceptually-optimized autoencoder, enabling an
attention-based conditional U-Net to perform the fast, deterministic
conditional denoising diffusion process with drastically reduced overhead. On
the LDCT and Projection dataset, our model achieves superior perceptual
quality, surpassing CNN/GAN-based methods while rivaling the reconstruction
fidelity of computationally heavy diffusion models like DDPM and Dn-Dp. Most
critically, in the inference stage, our model is over 60x faster than
representative pixel space diffusion denoisers, while remaining competitive on
PSNR/SSIM scores. By bridging the gap between high fidelity and clinical

TL;DR: VMDiff is a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes coherent objects by fusing two input images at noise and latent levels, addressing coexistent generation and semantic bias issues through hybrid sampling and adaptive parameter adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental but underexplored problem of fusing visual cues from multiple sources in image generation, which has applications in artistic creation, virtual reality, and visual media. Existing methods suffer from coexistent generation (juxtaposed objects without integration) and bias generation (one object dominating due to semantic imbalance).

Method: Proposes Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff) with: (1) hybrid sampling combining guided denoising, inversion, and spherical interpolation with adjustable parameters for structure-aware fusion; (2) adaptive adjustment module with similarity-based score to automatically search for optimal parameters to counter semantic bias.

Result: Experiments on 780 concept pairs show VMDiff outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic consistency, and human-rated creativity.

Conclusion: VMDiff effectively addresses coexistent and bias generation challenges in multi-source image fusion through its diffusion-based framework with hybrid sampling and adaptive parameter optimization.

Abstract: Creating novel images by fusing visual cues from multiple sources is a
fundamental yet underexplored problem in image-to-image generation, with broad
applications in artistic creation, virtual reality and visual media. Existing
methods often face two key challenges: coexistent generation, where multiple
objects are simply juxtaposed without true integration, and bias generation,
where one object dominates the output due to semantic imbalance. To address
these issues, we propose Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff), a simple yet
effective diffusion-based framework that synthesizes a single, coherent object
by integrating two input images at both noise and latent levels. Our approach
comprises: (1) a hybrid sampling process that combines guided denoising,
inversion, and spherical interpolation with adjustable parameters to achieve
structure-aware fusion, mitigating coexistent generation; and (2) an efficient
adaptive adjustment module, which introduces a novel similarity-based score to
automatically and adaptively search for optimal parameters, countering semantic
bias. Experiments on a curated benchmark of 780 concept pairs demonstrate that
our method outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic
consistency, and human-rated creativity.

*Liubing Hu,Chen Wu,Anrui Wang,Dianjie Lu,Guijuan Zhang,Zhuoran Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowLUT is an end-to-end image enhancement model that combines the efficiency of 3D LUTs with flow matching to achieve real-time processing while overcoming the representational limitations of traditional LUTs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and representational capacity in deep learning-based image enhancement methods, where conventional 3D LUTs are fast but lack flexibility and depend on fixed priors.

Method: Integrates differentiable 3D LUTs with multiple priors, uses a lightweight content-aware network to predict fusion weights for scene-adaptive color correction with O(1) complexity, and employs iterative flow matching to restore local structural details and eliminate artifacts.

Result: Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on three benchmarks, achieving real-time processing while maintaining high quality.

Conclusion: FlowLUT successfully combines the efficiency of LUTs with enhanced representational capacity through flow matching, providing an effective solution to the efficiency-representation trade-off in image enhancement.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image enhancement methods face a fundamental trade-off
between computational efficiency and representational capacity. For example,
although a conventional three-dimensional Look-Up Table (3D LUT) can process a
degraded image in real time, it lacks representational flexibility and depends
solely on a fixed prior. To address this problem, we introduce FlowLUT, a novel
end-to-end model that integrates the efficiency of LUTs, multiple priors, and
the parameter-independent characteristic of flow-matched reconstructed images.
Specifically, firstly, the input image is transformed in color space by a
collection of differentiable 3D LUTs (containing a large number of 3D LUTs with
different priors). Subsequently, a lightweight content-aware dynamically
predicts fusion weights, enabling scene-adaptive color correction with
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity. Next, a lightweight fusion prediction network runs
on multiple 3D LUTs, with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity for scene-adaptive color
correction.Furthermore, to address the inherent representation limitations of
LUTs, we design an innovative iterative flow matching method to restore local
structural details and eliminate artifacts. Finally, the entire model is
jointly optimized under a composite loss function enforcing perceptual and
structural fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on three benchmarks.

*Xinhao Cai,Minghang Zheng,Xin Jin,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pipeline for text-controlled human-object interaction generation in 3D scenes with movable objects, addressing challenges in object identification, diverse interaction patterns, and collision avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human-scene interaction datasets have limited interaction categories and only consider static objects. Collecting datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly, creating a need for better solutions.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Use 3D visual grounding to identify interaction objects, 2) Hand-object joint affordance learning for contact region prediction, 3) Optimization with local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints.

Result: The method generates physically plausible, text-compliant interactions and shows superiority over existing approaches in comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively addresses the challenges of movable human-object interaction generation, enabling accurate object manipulation with collision avoidance in 3D scenes.

Abstract: We propose a novel task of text-controlled human object interaction
generation in 3D scenes with movable objects. Existing human-scene interaction
datasets suffer from insufficient interaction categories and typically only
consider interactions with static objects (do not change object positions), and
the collection of such datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly.
To address this problem, we construct the InteractMove dataset for Movable
Human-Object Interaction in 3D Scenes by aligning existing human object
interaction data with scene contexts, featuring three key characteristics: 1)
scenes containing multiple movable objects with text-controlled interaction
specifications (including same-category distractors requiring spatial and 3D
scene context understanding), 2) diverse object types and sizes with varied
interaction patterns (one-hand, two-hand, etc.), and 3) physically plausible
object manipulation trajectories. With the introduction of various movable
objects, this task becomes more challenging, as the model needs to identify
objects to be interacted with accurately, learn to interact with objects of
different sizes and categories, and avoid collisions between movable objects
and the scene. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel pipeline solution.
We first use 3D visual grounding models to identify the interaction object.
Then, we propose a hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact
regions for different hand joints and object parts, enabling accurate grasping
and manipulation of diverse objects. Finally, we optimize interactions with
local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring physically
plausible motions and avoiding collisions between objects and the scene.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in generating
physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing
approaches.

TL;DR: BioVessel-Net is an unsupervised generative framework for retinal vessel segmentation that integrates vessel biostatistics with adversarial refinement, achieving near-perfect accuracy without labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vessel segmentation approaches rely on supervised learning and manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography.

Method: Integrates vessel biostatistics with adversarial refinement and radius-guided segmentation strategy, directly modeling vascular structures with biostatistical coherence instead of pixel-based methods.

Result: Achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised methods.

Conclusion: Provides a label-free, computationally efficient, and clinically interpretable solution for retinal vessel analysis with broad potential for glaucoma monitoring, blood flow modeling, and progression prediction.

Abstract: Structural changes in retinal blood vessels are critical biomarkers for the
onset and progression of glaucoma and other ocular diseases. However, current
vessel segmentation approaches largely rely on supervised learning and
extensive manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to
obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography. Here we present
BioVessel-Net, an unsupervised generative framework that integrates vessel
biostatistics with adversarial refinement and a radius-guided segmentation
strategy. Unlike pixel-based methods, BioVessel-Net directly models vascular
structures with biostatistical coherence, achieving accurate and explainable
vessel extraction without labeled data or high-performance computing. To
support training and evaluation, we introduce RetinaMix, a new benchmark
dataset of 2D and 3D OCTA images with high-resolution vessel details from
diverse populations. Experimental results demonstrate that BioVessel-Net
achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing
datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and
semi-supervised methods. Together, BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a
label-free, computationally efficient, and clinically interpretable solution
for retinal vessel analysis, with broad potential for glaucoma monitoring,
blood flow modeling, and progression prediction. Code and dataset are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffInk is a latent diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation that uses a dual-regularized variational autoencoder and diffusion Transformer to achieve better glyph accuracy and style fidelity than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing text-to-online handwriting generation methods focus on character- or word-level generation, which is inefficient and lacks holistic structural modeling for full text lines.

Method: Proposes DiffInk with two main components: (1) InkVAE - a sequential variational autoencoder with OCR-based loss for glyph accuracy and style-classification loss for style preservation, and (2) InkDiT - a latent diffusion Transformer that integrates target text and reference styles to generate pen trajectories.

Result: DiffInk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while significantly improving generation efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by enabling full-line handwriting generation with better accuracy, style preservation, and efficiency.

Abstract: Deep generative models have advanced text-to-online handwriting generation
(TOHG), which aims to synthesize realistic pen trajectories conditioned on
textual input and style references. However, most existing methods still
primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, resulting in
inefficiency and a lack of holistic structural modeling when applied to full
text lines. To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent
diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first
introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two
complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss
enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving
writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent
space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled.
We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates
target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories.
Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while
significantly improving generation efficiency. Code will be made publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIV introduces self-correction capability to Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models through Introspection Training and Recursive Inference, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MDVLMs lack self-correction ability and cannot fix errors in generated tokens, limiting their reliability.

Method: Two mechanisms: 1) Introspection Training - trains a model to detect grammatical, spelling, and logical errors; 2) Recursive Inference - alternating unmask→introspection→remask process until reliable results are obtained.

Result: RIV achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed RIV successfully equips MDVLMs with self-correction capability through recursive introspection, significantly improving model reliability and performance.

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to
correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction
capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion
Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction
ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training,
where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated
sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only
grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The
second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the
learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and
remask them. This alternating
($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$)
process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained.
Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

Method: FAMDA integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into a self-training paradigm to generate pseudo-labels for the target domain, distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a single efficient student network.

Result: FAMDA achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic-to-real UDA benchmarks and a challenging day-to-night adaptation task. A lightweight variant is 10x smaller than foundation models while maintaining SOTA accuracy.

Conclusion: FAMDA enables training of highly efficient, domain-adaptive models suitable for resource-constrained robotics applications by leveraging foundation models as teachers in a self-training framework.

Abstract: Multi-task dense prediction, which aims to jointly solve tasks like semantic
segmentation and depth estimation, is crucial for robotics applications but
suffers from domain shift when deploying models in new environments. While
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge for single tasks,
existing multi-task UDA methods primarily rely on adversarial learning
approaches that are less effective than recent self-training techniques. In
this paper, we introduce FAMDA, a simple yet effective UDA framework that
bridges this gap by leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as powerful
teachers. Our approach integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into
a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for the target
domain, effectively distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a
single, efficient student network. Extensive experiments show that FAMDA
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard synthetic-to-real UDA
multi-task learning (MTL) benchmarks and a challenging new day-to-night
adaptation task. Our framework enables the training of highly efficient models;
a lightweight variant achieves SOTA accuracy while being more than 10$\times$
smaller than foundation models, highlighting FAMDA's suitability for creating

Result: The framework achieves superior performance across a wide range of motion-relevant tasks, with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrating the effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: MotionVerse successfully integrates LLMs for comprehensive motion understanding and generation, with its components effectively addressing motion representation, computational efficiency, and modality interference challenges.

Abstract: This paper proposes MotionVerse, a unified framework that harnesses the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend, generate, and edit
human motion in both single-person and multi-person scenarios. To efficiently
represent motion data, we employ a motion tokenizer with residual quantization,
which converts continuous motion sequences into multi-stream discrete tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce a \textit{Delay Parallel} Modeling strategy, which
temporally staggers the encoding of residual token streams. This design enables
LLMs to effectively capture inter-stream dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency comparable to single-stream modeling. Moreover, to
alleviate modality interference between motion and language, we design a
\textit{dual-tower architecture} with modality-specific parameters, ensuring
stable integration of motion information for both comprehension and generation
tasks. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each
component in MotionVerse, and extensive experiments showcase its superior
performance across a wide range of motion-relevant tasks.

Motivation: Existing methods for fair T2I DMs either require full-parameter training or auxiliary networks, leading to heavy computational burden and unsatisfactory performance. The text encoder is identified as a key source of bias that needs addressing.

Method: Proposes fine-tuning text embeddings using collaborative distance-constrained debiasing to balance embedding distances, combined with a two-stage text-guided sampling strategy that limits when the debiased text encoder intervenes to preserve generation quality.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art debiasing performance on Stable Diffusion v1.5 with only 1/4 of the training burden compared to existing methods, and virtually no increase in sampling burden.

Conclusion: LightFair provides an effective and efficient approach to fairness in text-to-image diffusion models by focusing on text encoder bias mitigation through lightweight fine-tuning and strategic sampling.

Abstract: This paper explores a novel lightweight approach LightFair to achieve fair
text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) by addressing the adverse effects of
the text encoder. Most existing methods either couple different parts of the
diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for
correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory
performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text
encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on
mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we
observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial
skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More
importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To
finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained
debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness
without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the
original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage
text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder
intervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and
efficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA
debiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in
sampling burden. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/LightFair.

*Chengying She,Ben Wang,Xinran Zhang,Dongjie Fan,Jialu Zhang,Chengwei Chen,Lizhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientMIL is a linear-complexity multiple instance learning approach for whole slide image classification that replaces quadratic-complexity self-attention with efficient sequence models (GRU, LSTM, Mamba) and includes an Adaptive Patch Selector, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art MIL methods for whole slide image classification rely on attention mechanisms with quadratic complexity, requiring substantial computational resources when processing hundreds of thousands of patches, creating a computational bottleneck.

Method: Introduced EfficientMIL with Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) for patches selection, replacing quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient linear-complexity sequence models including GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model Mamba.

APS was also more effective for patches selection than conventional strategies.

Conclusion: EfficientMIL provides significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL methods across multiple histopathology datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of linear-complexity sequence models for whole slide image classification.

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge
in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged
as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on
attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial
computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of
thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce
EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification
with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we
designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in
Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including
RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves
significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL
methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset,
EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on
CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of
0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than
conventional selection strategies.

*Yixiao Chen,Ruining Yang,Xin Chen,Jia He,Dongliang Xu,Yue Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Survey on topology-aware perception for autonomous driving, covering vectorized map construction, topological structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static maps are costly, hard to update in real-time, and lack generalization, limiting scalability for autonomous driving systems.

Method: Systematic review of four research directions: vectorized map construction, topological structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based perception.

Result: Identifies a paradigm shift from static pre-built maps to dynamic sensor-driven perception for more adaptive autonomous driving.

Conclusion: Dynamic representations leveraging on-board sensor data enable more adaptive, scalable, and explainable autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: The key to achieving autonomous driving lies in topology-aware perception,
the structured understanding of the driving environment with an emphasis on
lane topology and road semantics. This survey systematically reviews four core
research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological
structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based
perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm
shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception.
Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for
autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update
in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their
scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data
for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four
research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling,
semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and
multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models.
Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable
autonomous driving systems.

*Aryan Mikaeili,Amirhossein Alimohammadi,Negar Hassanpour,Ali Mahdavi-Amiri,Andrea Tagliasacchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method for multi-image layout control that uses images instead of text to specify content and provides explicit placement guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models lack precise control over object placement and composition, needing more explicit guidance for finer control over content positioning.

Method: Training-free approach using single image references per object, providing explicit control for object and part-level composition without requiring model retraining.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness across various image composition tasks, enabling precise placement of content elements specified through images rather than text.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses multi-image layout control challenges by providing simple, explicit control over object placement using image-based references.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have achieved a level of realism that enables the
generation of highly convincing images. However, text-based control can be a
limiting factor when more explicit guidance is needed. Defining both the
content and its precise placement within an image is crucial for achieving
finer control. In this work, we address the challenge of multi-image layout
control, where the desired content is specified through images rather than
text, and the model is guided on where to place each element. Our approach is
training-free, requires a single image per reference, and provides explicit and
simple control for object and part-level composition. We demonstrate its
effectiveness across various image composition tasks.

*Lu Xiao,Jiale Zhang,Yang Liu,Taicheng Huang,Xin Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparse-Up is a memory-efficient 3D texture modeling framework that preserves high-frequency details using sparse voxels, surface anchoring, and view-domain partitioning to overcome resolution constraints while maintaining multi-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D asset creation methods face a trade-off between cross-view consistency and fine texture detail, often losing high-frequency details due to resolution limitations of explicit voxels or suffering from torn/drifting textures.

Method: Uses sparse voxels for texture reconstruction with multi-view consistency. Implements surface anchoring with learnable upsampling to eliminate redundant voxels, and view-domain partitioning with image patch-guided voxel partitioning to reduce memory consumption during high-resolution training.

Result: The method eliminates over 70% of redundant voxels compared to traditional voxel upsampling, significantly reduces memory consumption during high-resolution training, and preserves high-frequency texture details while maintaining geometric consistency.

Conclusion: Sparse-Up successfully addresses the pixel-level pain point in 3D asset creation by providing a memory-efficient framework that preserves high-frequency texture details without sacrificing cross-view geometric consistency.

Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity 3D assets is often hindered by a 'pixel-level
pain point': the loss of high-frequency details. Existing methods often trade
off one aspect for another: either sacrificing cross-view consistency,
resulting in torn or drifting textures, or remaining trapped by the resolution
ceiling of explicit voxels, forfeiting fine texture detail. In this work, we
propose Sparse-Up, a memory-efficient, high-fidelity texture modeling framework
that effectively preserves high-frequency details. We use sparse voxels to
guide texture reconstruction and ensure multi-view consistency, while
leveraging surface anchoring and view-domain partitioning to break through
resolution constraints. Surface anchoring employs a learnable upsampling
strategy to constrain voxels to the mesh surface, eliminating over 70% of
redundant voxels present in traditional voxel upsampling. View-domain
partitioning introduces an image patch-guided voxel partitioning scheme,
supervising and back-propagating gradients only on visible local patches.
Through these two strategies, we can significantly reduce memory consumption
during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric
consistency, while preserving high-frequency details in textures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for robust 6D pose estimation that combines initial pose estimation with fast motion-based tracking using shared lighting-invariant color-pair features, optimized for edge device efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of robust 6D pose estimation under difficult lighting conditions while balancing accuracy and real-time performance, particularly for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Uses a shared lighting-invariant color-pair feature representation that supports both initial pose estimation (via registration between RGB-D view and 3D mesh) and tracking (via temporal correspondence validation with lightweight motion regression).

Result: Extensive experiments show the integrated approach provides competitive pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking through abrupt pose changes, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully addresses the trade-off between accurate initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking through shared feature representation, making it suitable for edge device deployment.

Abstract: Robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects under challenging illumination
remains a significant challenge, often requiring a trade-off between accurate
initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking. We present a unified
framework explicitly designed for efficient execution on edge devices, which
synergizes a robust initial estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker.
The key to our approach is a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature
representation that forms a consistent foundation for both stages. For initial
estimation, this feature facilitates robust registration between the live RGB-D
view and the object's 3D mesh. For tracking, the same feature logic validates
temporal correspondences, enabling a lightweight model to reliably regress the
object's motion. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our integrated approach is both effective and robust, providing competitive
pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through
abrupt pose changes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReWatch addresses the data bottleneck in video reasoning by creating a large-scale dataset with multi-hop questions and video-grounded Chain-of-Thought data, enabling RLVR training that achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack challenging multi-hop questions and high-quality video-grounded Chain-of-Thought data needed for effective Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) in complex video reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposed ReWatch dataset with three components synthesized through multi-stage pipeline, including Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis. Developed ReWatch-R1 model using SFT and RLVR with novel Observation & Reasoning reward mechanism.

Result: ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The ReWatch dataset and RLVR framework successfully address the data bottleneck in video reasoning, enabling significant advances in complex video understanding through verifiable reward mechanisms.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) significantly
advances image reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), its
application to complex video reasoning remains underdeveloped. This gap stems
primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the
challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address
this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced
video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to
synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT.
A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which
simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded
reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification.
Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong
baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This
framework incorporates a novel Observation \& Reasoning (O\&R) reward mechanism
that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's
alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our
experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance
on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

*Jingqi Xu,Jingxi Lu,Chenghao Li,Sreetama Sarkar,Peter A. Beerel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HIVTP is a training-free method that improves Vision-Language Models efficiency through hierarchical visual token pruning using middle-layer attention maps for importance scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models suffer from inefficient inference due to excessive visual tokens from vision encoders, many of which are unimportant and can be pruned without performance loss.

Method: Uses attention maps from middle layers of vision encoder to estimate token importance, then performs hierarchical pruning: global stage retains important tokens per image region, local stage retains most important token per small window.

Result: Reduces time-to-first-token by up to 55.1% for LLaVA models, improves token generation throughput by up to 60.9%, maintains or even improves accuracy on benchmarks.

Conclusion: HIVTP achieves superior accuracy and higher inference efficiency compared to prior works, demonstrating effective visual token pruning without training.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse
multimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the
vision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have
shown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely
pruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs
efficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel
middle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps
extracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect
fine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance.
Based on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain
both globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the
1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial
layout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and
retain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local
retaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the
most important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our
proposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of
LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and
improve the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without
sacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks.
Compared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher
inference efficiency.

TL;DR: STIM-TM is a spatiotemporal token merging method for surgical video understanding that reduces computational costs by 65%+ GFLOPs while maintaining accuracy through independent temporal and spatial token reduction strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision Transformer methods for surgical video understanding suffer from high computational costs due to processing massive spatiotemporal tokens, and existing token merging approaches fail to properly consider video structure and heterogeneous information distribution.

Method: STIM-TM uses a decoupled strategy: temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive frames using saliency weighting, while spatial component prioritizes merging static tokens through temporal stability analysis to protect dynamic regions with surgical information.

Result: The method achieves over 65% GFLOPs reduction while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video tasks, and supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical videos.

Conclusion: STIM-TM provides an effective training-free solution for computational efficiency in surgical video understanding by properly addressing spatiotemporal structure and information distribution heterogeneity.

Abstract: Vision Transformer models have shown impressive effectiveness in the surgical
video understanding tasks through long-range dependency modeling. However,
current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing
massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames. While prior work on token
merging has advanced model efficiency, they fail to adequately consider the
inherent spatiotemporal structure of video data and overlook the heterogeneous
nature of information distribution, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM)
method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video
understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token
redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically,
the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive
frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and
maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging
static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions
containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner,
STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\%$ GFLOPs reduction
while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video
tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical
videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.

assess genuine global reasoning or allow success via localized visual cues.
Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction,
hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.
  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to

  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that
most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases,
indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers &

TL;DR: MSD-KMamba is a 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework that integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale self-distillation to achieve high segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN-Transformer hybrid models suffer from high computational complexity due to global attention mechanisms, making it challenging to balance performance with efficiency for complex segmentation tasks.

Method: The framework combines a bidirectional spatial aware branch for capturing long-range spatial context dependencies with a multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy that strengthens hierarchical feature representations across different resolution levels.

Result: Extensive experiments show MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy, robustness, and generalization while maintaining high computational efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: MSD-KMamba effectively addresses the computational complexity bottleneck in volumetric segmentation while overcoming limitations of insufficient global perception, offering a balanced solution for efficient and accurate 3D multi-modal image segmentation.

Abstract: Numerous CNN-Transformer hybrid models rely on high-complexity global
attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, which introduces
non-linear computational complexity and leads to significant resource
consumption. Although knowledge distillation and sparse attention mechanisms
can improve efficiency, they often fall short of delivering the high
segmentation accuracy necessary for complex tasks. Balancing model performance
with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this work, we
propose a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework, termed MSD-KMamba,
which integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale
self-distillation. The bidirectional spatial aware branch effectively captures
long-range spatial context dependencies across brain regions, while also
incorporating a powerful nonlinear feature extraction mechanism that further
enhances the model's ability to learn complex and heterogeneous patterns. In
addition, the proposed multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy strengthens
hierarchical feature representations and improves the transfer of semantic
information at different resolution levels. By jointly leveraging the
bidirectional spatial perception branch and the multi-scale self-distilled
fusion strategy, our framework effectively mitigates the bottleneck of
quadratic computational complexity in volumetric segmentation, while
simultaneously addressing the limitation of insufficient global perception.
Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation
accuracy, robustness, and generalization, while maintaining high computational
efficiency and favorable scalability. The source code of MSD-KMamba is publicly

TL;DR: QuantSparse is a unified framework that combines model quantization and attention sparsification to compress diffusion transformers for video generation, achieving significant efficiency gains without severe performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers have excellent video generation capabilities but suffer from high computational and memory costs that hinder practical deployment. Existing compression methods like quantization or sparsification alone cause severe performance degradation under aggressive compression.

Method: Proposes QuantSparse framework with two key components: 1) Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation using global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate quantization bias, and 2) Second-Order Sparse Attention Reparameterization that exploits temporal stability of second-order residuals to recover information lost under sparsity.

Result: Achieves 20.88 PSNR on HunyuanVideo-13B, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art quantization baseline Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), with 3.68× storage reduction and 1.88× end-to-end inference acceleration.

Conclusion: QuantSparse successfully integrates quantization and sparsification to achieve compounded efficiency gains while maintaining high video generation quality, making diffusion transformers more practical for deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers exhibit remarkable video generation capability, yet
their prohibitive computational and memory costs hinder practical deployment.
Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions
for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under
aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains,
but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss
exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To
address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that
integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we
introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages
both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate
quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse
Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of
second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity.
Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88
PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline
Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$}
reduction in storage and \textbf{1.88$\times$} acceleration in end-to-end
inference. Our code will be released in

Motivation: Existing benchmarks oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual descriptions instead of visual information, and restrict agents with single static viewpoints, leading to incomplete hazard detection.

Method: Created HomeSafeBench with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards (fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, child safety) using dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated environments that allow free exploration.

Result: Evaluation of mainstream VLMs shows poor performance, with the best model achieving only 10.23% F1-score. Models struggle with hazard identification and exploration strategy selection.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have significant limitations in home safety inspection tasks. HomeSafeBench provides a valuable benchmark for future research in home security inspection systems.

environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety
inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key
limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual
descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which
hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language
Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental
observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the
omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a
fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a
benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards:
fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench
provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home
environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety
inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room,
HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments
for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs
on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an
F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs.
The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting
effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable
reference and support for future research related to home security inspections.
Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.

*Atharva Jadhav,Arush Karekar,Manas Divekar,Shachi Natu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ensemble of SSD models with diverse backbones using Weighted Boxes Fusion improves weapon detection robustness in surveillance systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public safety requires robust weapon detection systems that can handle challenges like occlusion, varying lighting, and cluttered backgrounds, where single models often lack robustness.

Method: Trained individual SSD models with VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3 backbones, then combined predictions using Weighted Boxes Fusion with max confidence scoring.

Result: Achieved mAP of 0.838, representing 2.948% improvement over best single model, consistently outperforming other fusion methods.

Conclusion: Confidence-aware fusion is critical for ensemble performance, offering robust real-time weapon detection for surveillance applications.

Abstract: The safety and security of public spaces is of vital importance, driving the
need for sophisticated surveillance systems capable of accurately detecting
weapons, which are often hampered by issues like partial occlusion, varying
lighting, and cluttered backgrounds. While single-model detectors are advanced,
they often lack robustness in these challenging conditions. This paper presents
the hypothesis that ensemble of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models with
diverse feature extraction backbones can significantly enhance detection
robustness. To leverage diverse feature representations, individual SSD models
were trained using a selection of backbone networks: VGG16, ResNet50,
EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3. The study is conducted on a dataset consisting
of images of three distinct weapon classes: guns, heavy weapons and knives. The
predictions from these models are combined using the Weighted Boxes Fusion
(WBF) method, an ensemble technique designed to optimize bounding box accuracy.
Our key finding is that the fusion strategy is as critical as the ensemble's
diversity, a WBF approach using a 'max' confidence scoring strategy achieved a
mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838. This represents a 2.948% relative
improvement over the best-performing single model and consistently outperforms
other fusion heuristics. This research offers a robust approach to enhancing
real-time weapon detection capabilities in surveillance applications by
demonstrating that confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism for improving
accuracy metrics of ensembles.

*Yunjiang Xu,Lingzhi Li,Jin Wang,Yupeng Ouyang,Benyuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INSTINCT is a novel collaborative perception framework that improves detection accuracy while significantly reducing communication bandwidth through instance-level interaction and quality-aware filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bandwidth constraints in collaborative perception systems while maintaining high detection accuracy, especially for LiDAR-based implementations that currently underperform compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Method: Proposes INSTINCT framework with three components: quality-aware filtering for instance selection, dual-branch detection routing to separate collaboration-relevant/irrelevant instances, and Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion module for feature aggregation. Also enhances GT sampling for training.

Result: Achieves 13.23% improvement in DAIR-V2X and 33.08% in V2V4Real datasets while reducing communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: INSTINCT effectively bridges the performance gap in LiDAR-based collaborative perception while dramatically reducing bandwidth requirements, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: Collaborative perception systems overcome single-vehicle limitations in
long-range detection and occlusion scenarios by integrating multi-agent sensory
data, improving accuracy and safety. However, frequent cooperative interactions
and real-time requirements impose stringent bandwidth constraints. Previous
works proves that query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth
demands and manual priors, however, LiDAR-focused implementations in
collaborative perception remain underdeveloped, with performance still trailing
state-of-the-art approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose INSTINCT
(INSTance-level INteraCtion ArchiTecture), a novel collaborative perception
framework featuring three core components: 1) a quality-aware filtering
mechanism for high-quality instance feature selection; 2) a dual-branch
detection routing scheme to decouple collaboration-irrelevant and
collaboration-relevant instances; and 3) a Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion
module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Additionally, we enhance
the ground truth (GT) sampling technique to facilitate training with diverse
hybrid instance features. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
demonstrate that INSTINCT achieves superior performance. Specifically, our
method achieves an improvement in accuracy 13.23%/33.08% in DAIR-V2X and
V2V4Real while reducing the communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared
to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

*Boseong Jeon,Junghyuk Lee,Jimin Park,Kwanyoung Kim,Jingi Jung,Sangwon Lee,Hyunbo Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrimEdit is a unified diffusion model that jointly handles object removal, insertion, and movement using classifier-free guidance and task embeddings, enabling efficient composite editing without separate training stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use separate models for object removal and insertion, with limited exploration of classifier-free guidance for handling object effects in a unified framework. The goal is to improve efficiency and performance in composite editing tasks.

Method: Proposes CrimEdit which jointly trains task embeddings for removal and insertion in a single model, uses classifier-free guidance to enhance effect handling, and extends task prompts to enable object movement in a single denoising step.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal/insertion stages.

Conclusion: CrimEdit demonstrates that unified training with classifier-free guidance enables efficient and high-quality composite editing across removal, insertion, and movement tasks within a single model.

Abstract: Recent works on object removal and insertion have enhanced their performance
by handling object effects such as shadows and reflections, using diffusion
models trained on counterfactual datasets. However, the performance impact of
applying classifier-free guidance to handle object effects across removal and
insertion tasks within a unified model remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap and improve efficiency in composite editing, we propose CrimEdit,
which jointly trains the task embeddings for removal and insertion within a
single model and leverages them in a classifier-free guidance scheme --
enhancing the removal of both objects and their effects, and enabling
controllable synthesis of object effects during insertion. CrimEdit also
extends these two task prompts to be applied to spatially distinct regions,
enabling object movement (repositioning) within a single denoising step. By
employing both guidance techniques, extensive experiments show that CrimEdit
achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient
object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal and
insertion stages.

*Shuai Shao,Shu Jiang,Shiyuan Zhao,Di Yang,Yan Wang,Yutong Bai,Jianguo Zhang,Jiangtao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PD-Diag-Net is an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for Parkinson's disease that uses MRI scans with clinical prior knowledge to achieve high accuracy in diagnosis, especially for early-stage detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Parkinson's disease diagnostic workflows are complex, rely heavily on neurologist expertise, and often result in delayed detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention.

Method: The framework includes MRI preprocessing to reduce variability, incorporates two clinical priors (brain region relevance and aging patterns), and uses dedicated modules for feature aggregation and diagnosis based on brain age gaps.

Result: PD-Diag-Net achieves 86% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing methods by more than 20%.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective automated solution for Parkinson's disease diagnosis with high accuracy and clinical interpretability, addressing limitations of current diagnostic approaches.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that severely
diminishes patients' quality of life. Its global prevalence has increased
markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and
heavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early
detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these
issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed
PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly
from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing
Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability
by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It
then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1)
Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions
strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior),
which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated
regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the
Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides
the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the
Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps
as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic
accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test
data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that
PD-Diag-Net achieves 86\% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in
early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than
20%.

*Zijun Li,Hongyu Yan,Shijie Li,Kunming Luo,Li Lu,Xulei Yang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffPCN is a diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion that uses depth image projection and denoising to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have shown strong generative capabilities but remain underexplored for point cloud completion due to the unstructured and irregular nature of point clouds.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Project partial point clouds to depth images, use DepthLDM to synthesize completed depth images and form coarse point clouds; 2) Point Denoising Network removes artifacts, followed by Association-Aware Point Upsampler for dense output.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly improving robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

Conclusion: DiffPCN effectively leverages LDMs' powerful generation capabilities for point cloud completion through a novel diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities across various low-level vision tasks. However, their potential
for point cloud completion remains underexplored due to the unstructured and
irregular nature of point clouds. In this work, we propose DiffPCN, a novel
diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion. Our
approach comprises two stages: an initial stage for generating coarse point
clouds, and a refinement stage that improves their quality through point
denoising and upsampling. Specifically, we first project the unordered and
irregular partial point cloud into structured depth images, which serve as
conditions for a well-designed DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view
depth images that are used to form coarse point clouds. In this way, our
DiffPCN can yield high-quality and high-completeness coarse point clouds by
leveraging LDM' s powerful generation and comprehension capabilities. Then,
since LDMs inevitably introduce outliers into the generated depth maps, we
design a Point Denoising Network to remove artifacts from the coarse point
cloud by predicting a per-point distance score. Finally, we devise an
Association-Aware Point Upsampler, which guides the upsampling process by
leveraging local association features between the input point cloud and the
corresponding coarse points, further yielding a dense and high-fidelity output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art
performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly
improving the robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

TL;DR: A training-free visual prompting method that combines multiple video frames into single panels to improve long-video understanding in Video-Language Models without additional parameters or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-Language Models perform well on images and short videos but lag in long-video understanding. Instead of complex fine-tuning with limited data, the authors aim to maximize existing model performance.

Method: Proposes a visual prompting strategy that trades spatial details for temporal resolution by combining multiple frames into single panel images. The approach is training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show consistent improvements across various model architectures. On TimeScope (Long) dataset with longest videos, video QA accuracy improved by up to 19.4%.

Conclusion: The method effectively raises the bar for long video understanding models through a simple yet effective visual prompting approach that can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLMs.

Abstract: Recent Video-Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results on long-video
understanding, but their performance still lags behind that achieved on tasks
involving images or short videos. This has led to great interest in improving
the long context modeling of VLMs by introducing novel modules and additional
complexity. % additional training time. In this paper, we take a different
approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we
attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose
a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video
understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we
effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is
training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established
benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context
windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long)
dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question
answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for
long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: M3DLayout is a large-scale multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation, addressing limitations in existing datasets through diverse sources and rich annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D indoor layout generation models are constrained by limited dataset scale, diversity, and annotation quality, which hinders learning complex spatial and semantic patterns.

Method: Created M3DLayout dataset with 15,080 layouts and 258k+ object instances from three sources: real-world scans, CAD designs, and procedurally generated scenes, paired with detailed structured text descriptions.

Result: Benchmark experiments using text-conditioned diffusion models show M3DLayout provides a solid foundation for training layout generation models, with multi-source composition enhancing diversity and enabling more complex scene generation.

Conclusion: M3DLayout serves as a valuable resource for advancing text-driven 3D scene synthesis research by providing diverse, richly annotated data that enables learning of complex spatial relationships.

Abstract: In text-driven 3D scene generation, object layout serves as a crucial
intermediate representation that bridges high-level language instructions with
detailed geometric output. It not only provides a structural blueprint for
ensuring physical plausibility but also supports semantic controllability and
interactive editing. However, the learning capabilities of current 3D indoor
layout generation models are constrained by the limited scale, diversity, and
annotation quality of existing datasets. To address this, we introduce
M3DLayout, a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation.
M3DLayout comprises 15,080 layouts and over 258k object instances, integrating
three distinct sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and
procedurally generated scenes. Each layout is paired with detailed structured
text describing global scene summaries, relational placements of large
furniture, and fine-grained arrangements of smaller items. This diverse and
richly annotated resource enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic
patterns across a wide variety of indoor environments. To assess the potential
of M3DLayout, we establish a benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion
model. Experimental results demonstrate that our dataset provides a solid
foundation for training layout generation models. Its multi-source composition
enhances diversity, notably through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich
small-object information, enabling the generation of more complex and detailed
scenes. We hope that M3DLayout can serve as a valuable resource for advancing
research in text-driven 3D scene synthesis.

*Shubhang Bhatnagar,Andy Xu,Kar-Han Tan,Narendra Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LUQ, a layerwise ultra-low bit quantization method for multimodal LLMs that selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to resilient layers, reducing memory usage by 31-40% compared to 4-bit models with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs require huge memory and computational resources, but existing post-training quantization methods designed for language models are less effective for multimodal models due to higher statistical variance in multimodal tokens.

Method: Proposed LUQ (Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization) which analyzes activation distributions across layers and selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers with lower entropy distributions that are more resilient to quantization. Also uses mixed multimodal tokens for PTQ.

Result: LUQ reduces memory usage by 40% for LLaVA-1.5 and 31% for Qwen-2.5-VL compared to 4-bit models, with less than 10% performance degradation on the MME benchmark across 9 VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Layerwise selective quantization based on activation entropy analysis enables effective ultra-low bit compression of multimodal LLMs, significantly reducing memory requirements while maintaining acceptable performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized
vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and
computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has
successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without
significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on
ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them
exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text
tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the
activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over
different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation
distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better
tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a
novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit
Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers
that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of
multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the
ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL
across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less
memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a
performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraTok is a multi-scale Vision Transformer tokenizer that uses multi-scale downsampling and scale-causal attention to improve image reconstruction and generation, achieving significant performance gains over single-scale approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of single-scale representations in Vision Transformer tokenizers by enabling multi-scale modeling for better visual generation tasks.

Method: Uses multi-scale downsampling on token maps and a scale-causal attention mechanism that progressively flows information from low-resolution global features to high-resolution details.

Result: 27.2% improvement in rFID (1.47→1.07), 1.38× faster convergence, 18.9% boost in gFID (16.4→13.3), and state-of-the-art performance with rFID 0.45 and gFID 1.82.

Conclusion: HieraTok demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-scale ViT tokenizers for visual generation, achieving superior performance and faster convergence through its novel architecture.

Abstract: In this work, we present HieraTok, a novel multi-scale Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based tokenizer that overcomes the inherent limitation of modeling
single-scale representations. This is realized through two key designs: (1)
multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer
encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal
attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from
low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details.
Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both
image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the
multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a
27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into
downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence
rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be
attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space.
Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its
potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based
tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings
and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.

TL;DR: GRS-SLAM3R is an end-to-end SLAM framework that improves dense scene reconstruction by incorporating spatial memory and global consistency through transformer-based gated updates and submap partitioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DUSt3R-based methods only use image pairs for pointmap estimation, overlooking spatial memory and global consistency, leading to less accurate reconstructions.

Method: Uses sequential input with latent state for spatial memory, transformer-based gated update module, submap partitioning with local alignment, and global registration of submaps.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance on various datasets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by incorporating spatial memory and global consistency mechanisms for improved dense scene reconstruction.

Abstract: DUSt3R-based end-to-end scene reconstruction has recently shown promising
results in dense visual SLAM. However, most existing methods only use image
pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global
consistency.To this end, we introduce GRS-SLAM3R, an end-to-end SLAM framework
for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation from RGB images without any
prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike existing DUSt3R-based
frameworks, which operate on all image pairs and predict per-pair point maps in
local coordinate frames, our method supports sequentialized input and
incrementally estimates metric-scale point clouds in the global coordinate. In
order to improve consistent spatial correlation, we use a latent state for
spatial memory and design a transformer-based gated update module to reset and
update the spatial memory that continuously aggregates and tracks relevant 3D
information across frames. Furthermore, we partition the scene into submaps,
apply local alignment within each submap, and register all submaps into a
common world frame using relative constraints, producing a globally consistent
map. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ResAD++ framework for class-agnostic anomaly detection using residual features and feature decorrelation to generalize across diverse new classes without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single- and multi-class AD methods perform poorly on new classes due to class-related representation learning and feature correlation issues.

Method: Learns residual feature distribution by subtracting normal reference features, uses feature hypersphere constraining for scale consistency, and incorporates logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss with vector quantization feature distribution matching.

Result: Achieves remarkable AD results on eight real-world datasets when directly applied to new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and the base ResAD version.

Conclusion: ResAD++ effectively addresses feature correlation issues in class-agnostic anomaly detection and demonstrates strong generalization capability across diverse domains without retraining.

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of class-agnostic anomaly detection (AD),
where the objective is to train one class-agnostic AD model that can generalize
to detect anomalies in diverse new classes from different domains without any
retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. When applied for new classes, the
performance of current single- and multi-class AD methods is still
unsatisfactory. One fundamental reason is that representation learning in
existing methods is still class-related, namely, feature correlation. To
address this issue, we propose residual features and construct a simple but
effective framework, termed ResAD. Our core insight is to learn the residual
feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. Residual
features are formed by matching and then subtracting normal reference features.
In this way, we can effectively realize feature decorrelation. Even in new
classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably
shift from the learned distribution. In addition, we think that residual
features still have one issue: scale correlation. To this end, we propose a
feature hypersphere constraining approach, which learns to constrain initial
normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for enabling the feature
scales of different classes as consistent as possible. Furthermore, we propose
a novel logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization
based feature distribution matching module to enhance ResAD, leading to the
improved version of ResAD (ResAD++). Comprehensive experiments on eight
real-world AD datasets demonstrate that our ResAD++ can achieve remarkable AD
results when directly used in new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art
competing methods and also surpassing ResAD. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Poivre is a self-refining procedure for visual pointing that enables VLMs to iteratively refine coordinates through a Point-Visualize-Refine process, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Point-Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs perform poorly on visual pointing tasks compared to humans, mainly because they're required to complete pointing in a single step without visual feedback, similar to asking humans to point without seeing their fingers.

Method: Proposed Point-Visualize-Refine (Poivre) procedure where VLMs first mark estimated points, then iteratively refine coordinates. Used reinforcement learning with a process reward to train this self-refining ability.

Result: Poivre-7B achieves new state-of-the-art on Point-Bench, outperforming proprietary models like Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models like Molmo-72B by over 3%.

Conclusion: The self-refining procedure with RL training significantly improves visual pointing performance, demonstrating the importance of iterative refinement in vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Visual pointing, which aims to localize a target by predicting its
coordinates on an image, has emerged as an important problem in the realm of
vision-language models (VLMs). Despite its broad applicability, recent
benchmarks show that current VLMs still fall far behind human performance on
this task. A key limitation is that VLMs are typically required to complete the
pointing task in a single step, akin to asking humans to point at an object
without seeing their own fingers. To address this issue, we propose a simple
yet effective self-refining procedure: Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre).
This procedure enables a VLM to first mark its estimated point, then
iteratively refine the coordinates if necessary. Inspired by advances of
reasoning models in the natural language domain, we employ reinforcement
learning (RL) to incentivize this self-refining ability. For the RL training,
we design a neat process reward that is not only empirically effective but also
grounded in appealing properties. Our trained model, Poivre-7B, sets a new
state of the art on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary models such as
Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models such as Molmo-72B by over 3%. To
support future research, we release our training and inference code, dataset,
and the Poivre-7B checkpoint.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer ranks among the most common and deadly cancers, emphasizing
the need for effective early detection and treatment. To address the
limitations of traditional colonoscopy, including high miss rates due to polyp
variability, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer Adapter Residual
Network (PVTAdpNet). This model integrates a U-Net-style encoder-decoder
structure with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks,
and adapter-based skip connections. The design enhances feature extraction,
dense prediction, and gradient flow, supported by squeeze-and-excitation
attention for improved channel-wise feature refinement. PVTAdpNet achieves
real-time, accurate polyp segmentation, demonstrating superior performance on
benchmark datasets with high mDice and mIoU scores, making it highly suitable
for clinical applications. PVTAdpNet obtains a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851
and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution
polyp datasets. Evaluation of the PolypGen dataset demonstrates PVTAdpNet's
capability for real-time, accurate performance within familiar distributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniAlignment is a unified multimodal generation framework using a single diffusion transformer with dual-stream training for enhanced cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for multimodal tasks rely heavily on vision-language models or modular designs, leading to fragmented architectures and computational inefficiency.

Method: Proposes UniAlignment with dual-stream diffusion training strategy incorporating both intrinsic-modal and cross-modal semantic alignment within a single diffusion transformer.

Result: Extensive experiments show UniAlignment outperforms existing baselines across multiple tasks and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates significant potential of diffusion models in unified multimodal generation with improved cross-modal consistency and instruction-following capabilities.

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has
sparked growing interest in expanding their capabilities to a variety of
multi-modal tasks, including image understanding, manipulation, and perception.
These tasks require advanced semantic comprehension across both visual and
textual modalities, especially in scenarios involving complex semantic
instructions. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on
vision-language models (VLMs) or modular designs for semantic guidance, leading
to fragmented architectures and computational inefficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose UniAlignment, a unified multimodal generation framework
within a single diffusion transformer. UniAlignment introduces a dual-stream
diffusion training strategy that incorporates both intrinsic-modal semantic
alignment and cross-modal semantic alignment, thereby enhancing the model's
cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness. Additionally, we
present SemGen-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
multimodal semantic consistency under complex textual instructions. Extensive
experiments across multiple tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that UniAlignment
outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the significant potential of
diffusion models in unified multimodal generation.

*Xiaojie Li,Bei Wang,Jianlong Wu,Yue Yu,Liqiang Nie,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenView++ improves contrastive learning by generating diverse, semantically coherent views through multi-source adaptive generation and implementing quality-driven learning that prioritizes high-quality pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive learning methods have limitations in view construction (limited diversity and semantic corruption) and learning mechanisms (treating all pairs equally without quality assessment).

Method: Introduces multi-source adaptive view generation with image/text/image-text conditioned strategies and quality-driven contrastive learning that assesses semantic alignment and diversity to dynamically reweight training pairs.

Result: Improves MoCov2 by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification, raises zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and +5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and improves Flickr30k text retrieval R@5 by +3.2%.

Conclusion: GenView++ effectively addresses both view construction and learning mechanism limitations in contrastive learning, demonstrating significant improvements across vision and vision-language tasks.

Abstract: The success of contrastive learning depends on the construction and
utilization of high-quality positive pairs. However, current methods face
critical limitations on two fronts: on the construction side, both handcrafted
and generative augmentations often suffer from limited diversity and risk
semantic corruption; on the learning side, the absence of a quality assessment
mechanism leads to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally.
To tackle these challenges, we propose GenView++, a unified framework that
addresses both fronts by introducing two synergistic innovations. To improve
pair construction, GenView++ introduces a multi-source adaptive view generation
mechanism to synthesize diverse yet semantically coherent views by dynamically
modulating generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned,
and image-text-conditioned strategies. Second, a quality-driven contrastive
learning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to
dynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality
pairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and
vision-language tasks. For vision representation learning, it improves MoCov2
by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification. For vision-language learning, it
raises the average zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and
+5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and further improves Flickr30k text
retrieval R@5 by +3.2%. The code is available at

### [151] [A Modality-Tailored Graph Modeling Framework for Urban Region Representation via Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23772)
*Yaya Zhao,Kaiqi Zhao,Zixuan Tang,Zhiyuan Liu,Xiaoling Lu,Yalei Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTGRR is a modality-tailored graph framework for urban region representation that addresses limitations in existing approaches by using specialized GNN architectures for different modality types and spatially-aware multimodal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based models use identical architectures across all modalities and neglect spatial heterogeneity in fusion, leading to suboptimal region representations.

Method: Categorizes modalities into aggregated-level and point-level groups, uses MoE GNN for aggregated modalities and dual-level GNN for point-level data, implements spatially-aware multimodal fusion with dynamic region-specific weights, and employs joint contrastive learning.

Result: MTGRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two real-world datasets across six modalities and three tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed modality-tailored graph modeling with spatially-aware fusion effectively captures modality-specific characteristics and spatial heterogeneity, leading to superior urban region representations.

Abstract: Graph-based models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling
multimodal urban data and learning region representations for various
downstream tasks. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. (1)
They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all
modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and
characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial
heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities
remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To
address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling
framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset
comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element,
remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into
two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level
and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a
mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed
by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific
characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed
to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective
region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware
multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific
modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR
further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region
aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region
representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities
and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.

### [152] [Texture Vector-Quantization and Reconstruction Aware Prediction for Generative Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23774)
*Qifan Li,Jiale Zou,Jinhua Zhang,Wei Long,Xinyu Zhou,Shuhang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TVQ&RAP, a generative super-resolution model that addresses limitations of existing VQ-based methods through texture vector-quantization and reconstruction-aware prediction strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQ-based methods have large quantization errors due to visual signal richness and train predictors with code-level supervision that doesn't consider final reconstruction errors, leading to sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy.

Method: Proposes two strategies: 1) Texture vector-quantization that only uses codebook to model prior of missing textures, leveraging super-resolution task characteristics; 2) Reconstruction aware prediction using straight-through estimator to train index predictor with image-level supervision.

Result: The proposed TVQ&RAP model delivers photo-realistic super-resolution results with small computational cost.

Conclusion: The texture vector-quantization and reconstruction-aware prediction strategies effectively address quantization errors and sub-optimal training in VQ-based visual prior modeling for super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Vector-quantized based models have recently demonstrated strong potential for
visual prior modeling. However, existing VQ-based methods simply encode visual
features with nearest codebook items and train index predictor with code-level
supervision. Due to the richness of visual signal, VQ encoding often leads to
large quantization error. Furthermore, training predictor with code-level
supervision can not take the final reconstruction errors into consideration,
result in sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy. In this paper we address the
above two issues and propose a Texture Vector-Quantization and a Reconstruction
Aware Prediction strategy. The texture vector-quantization strategy leverages
the task character of super-resolution and only introduce codebook to model the
prior of missing textures. While the reconstruction aware prediction strategy
makes use of the straight-through estimator to directly train index predictor
with image-level supervision. Our proposed generative SR model (TVQ&RAP) is
able to deliver photo-realistic SR results with small computational cost.

*Nayeong Kim,Seong Joon Oh,Suha Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupCoOp is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that uses group-specific text prompts to address spurious correlations from subgroup imbalance in vision-language models, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal parameter training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-efficient fine-tuned VLMs are vulnerable to spurious correlations from subgroup imbalance in training datasets, which affects their group robustness.

Method: Uses group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple classifiers for each target class, leveraging VLM text encoder knowledge to discover effective prompts even for minority groups.

Result: Achieved best results on five benchmarks across five CLIP architectures, occasionally outperforming methods that fine-tune the entire network while training only 0.016% of parameters.

Conclusion: GroupCoOp effectively enhances group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs by addressing subgroup imbalance issues through group-specific prompts, demonstrating superior performance with minimal parameter updates.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of vision-language models (VLMs)
excels in various vision tasks thanks to the rich knowledge and generalization
ability of VLMs. However, recent studies revealed that such fine-tuned VLMs are
vulnerable to spurious correlations stemming from the subgroup imbalance in the
fine-tuning datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Group Context
Optimization (GroupCoOp), a simple and effective debiased fine-tuning algorithm
that enhances the group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs. Its key idea is to
employ group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple
classifiers for their target class. The rich semantic knowledge of the text
encoder of VLM enables the discovery of effective group prompts even for groups
with a small number of training samples. Leveraging the group prompts for each
class addresses the issues caused by the group-imbalanced training set, such as
the neglect of minority groups and the scattered distribution of each class in
the embedding space. GroupCoOp achieved the best results on five benchmarks
across five CLIP architectures and occasionally outperformed prior methods that
fine-tune the entire network, despite training only 0.016\% of the network's
parameters.

Motivation: Ensuring consistently high-quality, industry-standard content in Procedural Content Generation remains challenging despite its efficiency benefits.

Method: Leverages object segmentation and visual analysis of level images to detect structural gaps and perform targeted repairs, evaluating multiple segmentation models.

Result: Experimental results show improved stability and playability of AI-generated levels.

Conclusion: The image-based approach is designed to be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures, despite being evaluated specifically on Angry Birds.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques enable automatic creation of
diverse and complex environments. While PCG facilitates more efficient content
creation, ensuring consistently high-quality, industry-standard content remains
a significant challenge. In this research, we propose a method to identify and
repair unstable levels generated by existing PCG models. We use Angry Birds as
a case study, demonstrating our method on game levels produced by established
PCG approaches. Our method leverages object segmentation and visual analysis of
level images to detect structural gaps and perform targeted repairs. We
evaluate multiple object segmentation models and select the most effective one
as the basis for our repair pipeline. Experimental results show that our method
improves the stability and playability of AI-generated levels. Although our
evaluation is specific to Angry Birds, our image-based approach is designed to
be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures.

TL;DR: A controllable framework for generating large-scale 3D vector urban layouts that combines geometric and semantic conditioning to create realistic urban models with user control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing urban modeling methods have limitations - image-based approaches lack geometric continuity and scalability, while graph-based methods ignore parcel semantics. There's a need for methods that can generate large-scale 3D urban layouts with both structural integrity and semantic understanding.

Method: Fuses geometric and semantic attributes, introduces edge weights, embeds building height in graph representations, and extends 2D layouts to 3D structures. Allows direct user control through semantic attribute modification.

Result: The method successfully produces valid, large-scale urban models that maintain geometric continuity while incorporating semantic information. It demonstrates scalability and realism in 3D urban structure generation.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective tool for data-driven urban planning and design, offering controllable generation of realistic 3D vector urban layouts that address limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Urban modeling is essential for city planning, scene synthesis, and gaming.
Existing image-based methods generate diverse layouts but often lack geometric
continuity and scalability, while graph-based methods capture structural
relations yet overlook parcel semantics. We present a controllable framework
for large-scale 3D vector urban layout generation, conditioned on both geometry
and semantics. By fusing geometric and semantic attributes, introducing edge
weights, and embedding building height in the graph, our method extends 2D
layouts to realistic 3D structures. It also enables users to directly control
the output by modifying semantic attributes. Experiments show that it produces
valid, large-scale urban models, offering an effective tool for data-driven

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-view imaging and manual inspection methods are prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, and lighting inconsistencies, requiring additional inspection stations that disrupt assembly lines and increase costs.

Method: Integrated multi-camera imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms, using three camera views and tailored image fusion methodology to combine results from multiple views. Developed a unique annotated dataset with diverse scenarios.

Result: Significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and recall rates in identifying improperly fastened small assembly parts such as screws.

Conclusion: Overcomes single-view limitations by providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate quality control mechanism that ensures reliability and safety of assembly lines. The dataset is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing, particularly in
ensuring the proper assembly of small components in production lines. Existing
solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are
prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting
inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional
inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to
increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality
control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera
imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images
from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of
components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines
results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing
detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset
comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting
conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world
manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach
significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and
recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts
such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming
single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate
quality control mechanism that ensures the reliability and safety of the
assembly line. The dataset used in this study is publicly available to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show impressive capabilities in reasoning and visual understanding, they reveal critical limitations in grasping privacy concepts, creating a need to evaluate how these models understand and enforce privacy principles.

Method: The authors introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy to capture privacy issues and evaluate several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using this framework.

Result: Evaluation reveals significant inconsistencies in VLMs' understanding of contextual privacy, highlighting their limitations in privacy comprehension.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems, and the work provides both a foundational taxonomy for future research and a benchmark of current model limitations.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence have profoundly transformed the technological
landscape in recent years. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive abilities in reasoning, text comprehension, contextual pattern
recognition, and integrating language with visual understanding. While these
advances offer significant benefits, they also reveal critical limitations in
the models' ability to grasp the notion of privacy. There is hence substantial
interest in determining if and how these models can understand and enforce
privacy principles, particularly given the lack of supporting resources to test
such a task. In this work, we address these challenges by examining how legal
frameworks can inform the capabilities of these emerging technologies. To this
end, we introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy that
captures a wide range of privacy issues, designed to be scalable and adaptable
to existing and future research needs. Furthermore, we evaluate the
capabilities of several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
revealing significant inconsistencies in their understanding of contextual
privacy. Our work contributes both a foundational taxonomy for future research
and a critical benchmark of current model limitations, demonstrating the urgent
need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems.

### [158] [Uni4D-LLM: A Unified SpatioTemporal-Aware VLM for 4D Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23828)
*Hanyu Zhou,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni4D-LLM is a unified vision-language model framework that enables both 4D scene understanding and generation within a single Transformer-based architecture, addressing the paradigm gap between autoregressive models for understanding and diffusion models for generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D/4D approaches separate scene understanding (using autoregressive models) and generation (using diffusion models), preventing a single model from handling both tasks, especially in dynamic 4D settings requiring spatiotemporal modeling.

Method: Extracts semantic features for understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation, incorporates 4D geometric cues, fuses them into spatiotemporal-aware visual representation via adaptive cross-attention, and integrates both tasks into a single LLM with task-specific heads.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models on multiple benchmarks, offering the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

Conclusion: Uni4D-LLM successfully unifies 4D scene understanding and generation through shared representation and architecture, demonstrating the feasibility of joint spatiotemporal modeling for both tasks within a single framework.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in 2D
scene understanding and generation, but extending this unification to the
physical world remains an open challenge. Existing 3D and 4D approaches
typically embed scene geometry into autoregressive model for semantic
understanding and diffusion model for content generation. This paradigm gap
prevents a single model from jointly handling both tasks, especially in dynamic
4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is critical. We propose Uni4D-LLM,
the first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene
understanding and generation. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1)
Unification requires a shared representation. We extract semantic features for
understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation,
incorporate 4D geometric cues, and fuse them into a spatiotemporal-aware visual
representation through adaptive cross-attention. 2) Unification requires a
shared architecture. Both autoregression and diffusion are built on Transformer
backbones, and this enables integration into a single LLM with task-specific
heads. By aligning visual and linguistic representations, our Uni4D-LLM
produces predictions for both understanding and generation within one
Transformer-based framework. We further apply instruction fine-tuning on
diverse 4D vision-language datasets to improve generalization across tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Uni4D-LLM
achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models
and offers the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and lack robustness against visual changes, occlusions, and scene shifts due to insufficient high-level conceptual understanding of targets.

Method: Uses Segment Concept (SeC) framework with Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish deep semantic understanding of objects for more persistent segmentation in zero-shot setting.

Result: Achieved 39.7 JFn on MOSEv2 test set and ranked 2nd place in Complex VOS track of 7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge without any fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SeC framework demonstrates strong zero-shot performance by leveraging semantic understanding through LVLM, overcoming limitations of appearance-based methods in complex video scenarios.

Abstract: Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation aims to segment a specified target
throughout a video sequence, initialized by a first-frame mask. Previous
methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and thus exhibit
limited robustness against challenges such as drastic visual changes,
occlusions, and scene shifts. This failure is often attributed to a lack of
high-level conceptual understanding of the target. The recently proposed
Segment Concept (SeC) framework mitigated this limitation by using a Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish a deep semantic understanding of the
object for more persistent segmentation. In this work, we evaluate its
zero-shot performance on the challenging coMplex video Object SEgmentation v2
(MOSEv2) dataset. Without any fine-tuning on the training set, SeC achieved
39.7 \JFn on the test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the
7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-3D quality assessment faces challenges including outdated benchmarks, coarse-grained evaluation, and limitations in objective metrics that lead to non-representative feature extraction and reduced robustness.

Method: Created T23D-CompBench with 5 components and 12 sub-components for compositional prompts, generating 3,600 textured meshes from 10 state-of-the-art models. Proposed Rank2Score with two-stage training: first stage uses supervised contrastive regression and curriculum learning for pairwise training, second stage refines predictions using mean opinion scores.

Result: Collected 129,600 reliable human ratings through large-scale subjective experiments. Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing metrics across multiple dimensions and can serve as a reward function to optimize generative models.

Conclusion: T23D-CompBench provides a comprehensive benchmark for compositional Text-to-3D generation, and Rank2Score demonstrates superior performance in quality assessment while being applicable as a reward function for model optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-3D (T23D) generative models have enabled the
synthesis of diverse, high-fidelity 3D assets from textual prompts. However,
existing challenges restrict the development of reliable T23D quality
assessment (T23DQA). First, existing benchmarks are outdated, fragmented, and
coarse-grained, making fine-grained metric training infeasible. Moreover,
current objective metrics exhibit inherent design limitations, resulting in
non-representative feature extraction and diminished metric robustness. To
address these limitations, we introduce T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for compositional T23D generation. We define five components with
twelve sub-components for compositional prompts, which are used to generate
3,600 textured meshes from ten state-of-the-art generative models. A
large-scale subjective experiment is conducted to collect 129,600 reliable
human ratings across different perspectives. Based on T23D-CompBench, we
further propose Rank2Score, an effective evaluator with two-stage training for
T23DQA. Rank2Score enhances pairwise training via supervised contrastive
regression and curriculum learning in the first stage, and subsequently refines
predictions using mean opinion scores to achieve closer alignment with human
judgments in the second stage. Extensive experiments and downstream
applications demonstrate that Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing
metrics across multiple dimensions and can additionally serve as a reward
function to optimize generative models. The project is available at

TL;DR: CE-FAM is a concept-based explanation method that identifies what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Saliency maps highlight important regions but leave interpretation to users, while concept-based explanations clarify contributions but few methods can simultaneously reveal learned concepts, their regions, and prediction contributions.

Method: Uses a branched network sharing activation maps with an image classifier, learns to mimic VLM embeddings, predicts concepts in images, represents regions via weighted sum of activation maps using gradient weights, and quantifies contributions based on impact on classification score.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, excels in zero-shot inference for unseen concepts, and provides a general framework for identifying concept regions and contributions without requiring annotated datasets.

Conclusion: CE-FAM successfully provides comprehensive concept-based explanations that reveal learned concepts, their regions, and prediction contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge for arbitrary concepts without dataset annotations.

Abstract: Although saliency maps can highlight important regions to explain the
reasoning behind image classification in artificial intelligence (AI), the
meaning of these regions is left to the user's interpretation. In contrast,
conceptbased explanations decompose AI predictions into humanunderstandable
concepts, clarifying their contributions. However, few methods can
simultaneously reveal what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions
are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions. We propose a
novel concept-based explanation method, Concept-based Explanation via Fusion of
Activation Maps (CE-FAM). It employs a branched network that shares activation
maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision
and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and
their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation
maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores.
Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image
classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying
the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to
handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the concept
regions. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our method
outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen
concepts.

### [162] [FairViT-GAN: A Hybrid Vision Transformer with Adversarial Debiasing for Fair and Explainable Facial Beauty Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23859)
*Djamel Eddine Boukhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairViT-GAN is a hybrid CNN-ViT framework with adversarial debiasing that achieves state-of-the-art facial beauty prediction accuracy while significantly reducing ethnic bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current FBP models including architectural constraints, demographic biases, and lack of transparency. CNNs struggle with global facial harmony while ViTs miss fine details, and models perpetuate societal biases.

Method: Hybrid framework combining CNN branch for local feature extraction and ViT branch for global context modeling, with adversarial debiasing mechanism to produce protected-attribute-invariant representations.

Result: Achieves Pearson Correlation of 0.9230 and RMSE of 0.2650 on SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark. Reduces performance gap between ethnic subgroups by 82.9%, with adversary accuracy dropping to 52.1%.

Conclusion: FairViT-GAN provides a robust, transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for responsible AI systems in subjective visual assessment.

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) has made significant strides with the
application of deep learning, yet state-of-the-art models often exhibit
critical limitations, including architectural constraints, inherent demographic
biases, and a lack of transparency. Existing methods, primarily based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel at capturing local texture but
struggle with global facial harmony, while Vision Transformers (ViTs)
effectively model long-range dependencies but can miss fine-grained details.
Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and
perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To
address these interconnected challenges, we propose \textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a
novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local
feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More
significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the
feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are
invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic
bias. Our framework's transparency is enhanced by visualizing the distinct
focus of each architectural branch. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500
benchmark demonstrate that FairViT-GAN not only sets a new state-of-the-art in
predictive accuracy, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9230} and
reducing RMSE to \textbf{0.2650}, but also excels in fairness. Our analysis
reveals a remarkable \textbf{82.9\% reduction in the performance gap} between
ethnic subgroups, with the adversary's classification accuracy dropping to
near-random chance (52.1\%). We believe FairViT-GAN provides a robust,
transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for developing responsible AI
systems for subjective visual assessment.

*Jiajin Tang,Zhengxuan Wei,Yuchen Zhu,Cheng Shi,Guanbin Li,Liang Lin,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sim-DETR improves temporal sentence grounding by addressing query conflicts in DETR through constrained self-attention and query-to-frame alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DETR enhancements degrade performance in temporal sentence grounding due to query conflicts from similar target moments and tension between global semantics and local localization.

Method: Extends standard DETR with two decoder modifications: (1) constraining self-attention between queries based on semantic and positional overlap, (2) adding query-to-frame alignment to bridge global and local contexts.

Result: Sim-DETR unlocks DETR's full potential for temporal sentence grounding, providing a strong baseline for future research.

Conclusion: The proposed Sim-DETR baseline effectively addresses query conflict issues in DETR for temporal sentence grounding through simple but powerful modifications.

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to identify exact moments in a video that
correspond to a given textual query, typically addressed with detection
transformer (DETR) solutions. However, we find that typical strategies designed
to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this
task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal
behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2)
internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local
localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful
baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor
modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between
queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding
query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments
demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal
sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

*Ky Dan Nguyen,Hoang Lam Tran,Anh-Dung Dinh,Daochang Liu,Weidong Cai,Xiuying Wang,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG) addresses information inconsistencies in autoregressive image generation by anchoring guidance to semantically important regions through attention, improving image quality and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for image generation suffer from information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps due to progressive resolution scaling, which causes guidance signals to drift away from conditioning information and results in ambiguous, unfaithful features.

Method: Proposed Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG) that anchors guidance to semantically important regions through attention, adaptively reinforcing informative patches during sampling to ensure guidance and content remain tightly aligned.

Result: IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically grounded images across both class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

Conclusion: IGG effectively tackles the critical weakness of information inconsistencies in autoregressive image generation, enabling better guidance-signal alignment and improved image quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models based on next-scale prediction are rapidly
emerging as a powerful tool for image generation, but they face a critical
weakness: information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps
introduced by progressive resolution scaling. These inconsistencies scatter
guidance signals, causing them to drift away from conditioning information and
leaving behind ambiguous, unfaithful features. We tackle this challenge with
Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance
to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing
informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content
remain tightly aligned. Across both class-conditioned and text-to-image
generation tasks, IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically
grounded images, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

*Hitesh Laxmichand Patel,Amit Agarwal,Srikant Panda,Hansa Meghwani,Karan Dua,Paul Li,Tao Sheng,Sujith Ravi,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCRI is a new metric to measure MLLM robustness to visual context variations by comparing performance between image patches and full images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM evaluation metrics don't capture sensitivity to irrelevant visual context, which undermines real-world reliability.

Method: PCRI systematically quantifies robustness by measuring performance changes between localized image patches and full-image input across 19 MLLMs and 15 benchmarks.

Result: Most leading MLLMs are brittle to background noise, with only InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B showing consistent robustness. PCRI reveals how different architectures handle visual context.

Conclusion: PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting better model selection and guiding development of more robust MLLMs for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world
settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual
context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics. We introduce
the \textbf{Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)}, the first systematic and
interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual
context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image
patches and full-image input.
  Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language
benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background
noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating
consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different
model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable
diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.
  PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled
model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and
training strategies for robust, real-world deployment.

### [166] [Learning Adaptive Pseudo-Label Selection for Semi-Supervised 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23880)
*Taehun Kong,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a learnable pseudo-labeling module for semi-supervised 3D object detection that automatically selects high-quality pseudo-labels using context-adaptive thresholds and score fusion, with a soft supervision strategy to handle label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pseudo-label-based methods for SS3DOD manually set confidence thresholds or use partial information, overlooking contextual factors like object distances, classes, and learning states, leading to suboptimal pseudo-label selection.

Method: Introduces two networks at teacher output level that assess pseudo-label quality through score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds supervised by alignment with ground truth boxes, plus a soft supervision strategy for robust learning under label noise.

Result: Extensive experiments on KITTI and Waymo datasets show the method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining wider context coverage and higher recall, significantly improving SS3DOD performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of previous methods by automatically and adaptively selecting high-quality pseudo-labels using contextual information and robust supervision strategies.

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection (SS3DOD) aims to reduce costly 3D
annotations utilizing unlabeled data. Recent studies adopt pseudo-label-based
teacher-student frameworks and demonstrate impressive performance. The main
challenge of these frameworks is in selecting high-quality pseudo-labels from
the teacher's predictions. Most previous methods, however, select pseudo-labels
by comparing confidence scores over thresholds manually set. The latest works
tackle the challenge either by dynamic thresholding or refining the quality of
pseudo-labels. Such methods still overlook contextual information e.g. object
distances, classes, and learning states, and inadequately assess the
pseudo-label quality using partial information available from the networks. In
this work, we propose a novel SS3DOD framework featuring a learnable
pseudo-labeling module designed to automatically and adaptively select
high-quality pseudo-labels. Our approach introduces two networks at the teacher
output level. These networks reliably assess the quality of pseudo-labels by
the score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds, which are
supervised by the alignment of pseudo-labels over GT bounding boxes.
Additionally, we introduce a soft supervision strategy that can learn robustly
under pseudo-label noises. This helps the student network prioritize cleaner
labels over noisy ones in semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on
the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The
proposed method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining a wider
coverage of contexts and a higher recall rate, significantly improving relevant
SS3DOD methods.

### [167] [Tunable-Generalization Diffusion Powered by Self-Supervised Contextual Sub-Data for Low-Dose CT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23885)
*Guoquan Wei,Zekun Zhou,Liu Shi,Wenzhe Shan,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperDiff is a self-supervised tunable-generalization diffusion method for low-dose CT denoising that uses contextual sub-data similarity adaptive sensing and knowledge distillation with latent diffusion models, requiring only LDCT projection data for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily on paired data and generalize poorly, while diffusion models need clean data distribution learning which is difficult in medical applications. Self-supervised methods face generalization degradation when expanding to other doses.

Method: Proposes SuperDiff with contextual sub-data similarity adaptive sensing in projection domain, knowledge distillation combined with latent diffusion models for detail optimization, and pixel-level self-correcting fusion for image fidelity enhancement. Uses dual-domain strategy cascade requiring only LDCT projection data.

Result: SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction and generalization performance on datasets and real data, with full qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses generalization challenges in low-dose CT denoising through self-supervised contextual sub-data and tunable diffusion, achieving superior performance without requiring paired data or clean data distributions.

Abstract: Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily
on paired data and generalize poorly. Even the more concerned diffusion models
need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is
difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time,
self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of
generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other
doses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of
tunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data
for low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata
similarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the
LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent
progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge
distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing
image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and
the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained
reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the
initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is
flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen
doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising,
SuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing.
Full qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data
show that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in terms of reconstruction and generalization performance.

### [168] [AssemblyHands-X: Modeling 3D Hand-Body Coordination for Understanding Bimanual Human Activities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23888)
*Tatsuro Banno,Takehiko Ohkawa,Ruicong Liu,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AssemblyHands-X is the first markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities that enables studying hand-body coordination effects on action recognition, showing that joint modeling of hand and body cues improves recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack systematic evaluation of hand-body coordination in bimanual activities, with limitations including either separate hand/body annotations or marker-based capture that introduces visual artifacts and limits generalization to natural videos.

Method: Developed a pipeline combining multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh fitting for reliable 3D hand-body pose annotation from synchronized multi-view videos, then validated different input representations across graph convolution and spatio-temporal attention models.

Result: Pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video baselines, and joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action recognition over using hands or upper body alone.

Conclusion: Modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics is crucial for holistic understanding of bimanual activities, as demonstrated by the improved performance when jointly considering hand and body coordination.

Abstract: Bimanual human activities inherently involve coordinated movements of both
hands and body. However, the impact of this coordination in activity
understanding has not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of suitable
datasets. Such evaluation demands kinematic-level annotations (e.g., 3D pose)
for the hands and body, yet existing 3D activity datasets typically annotate
either hand or body pose. Another line of work employs marker-based motion
capture to provide full-body pose, but the physical markers introduce visual
artifacts, thereby limiting models' generalization to natural, markerless
videos. To address these limitations, we present AssemblyHands-X, the first
markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, designed to study
the effect of hand-body coordination for action recognition. We begin by
constructing a pipeline for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view
videos. Our approach combines multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh
fitting, yielding reliable 3D registration of hands and upper body. We then
validate different input representations (e.g., video, hand pose, body pose, or
hand-body pose) across recent action recognition models based on graph
convolution or spatio-temporal attention. Our extensive experiments show that
pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video
baselines. Moreover, joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action
recognition over using hands or upper body alone, highlighting the importance
of modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics for a holistic understanding of
bimanual activities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCU is a cross-modal contrastive unlearning framework that addresses privacy leakage in visual data while preserving cross-modal knowledge and intra-class structural stability, achieving 7.12% accuracy improvement with 7% unlearning time compared to baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual modality is most vulnerable to privacy leakage in multimodal applications, and existing unlearning methods fail to preserve cross-modal knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability during visual unlearning.

Method: Proposes Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning (CCU) with three components: selective visual unlearning using inverse contrastive learning, cross-modal knowledge retention through semantic consistency, and dual-set contrastive separation to isolate structural perturbations.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets show CCU achieves 7.12% accuracy improvement with only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

Conclusion: CCU effectively addresses privacy leakage in visual data while maintaining cross-modal knowledge and model performance, demonstrating superior efficiency and accuracy over existing methods.

Abstract: Visual modality is the most vulnerable to privacy leakage in real-world
multimodal applications like autonomous driving with visual and radar data;
Machine unlearning removes specific training data from pre-trained models to
address privacy leakage, however, existing methods fail to preserve cross-modal
knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability of retain data, leading
to reduced overall and other modalities' performance during visual unlearning;
to address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning
(CCU) framework, which integrates three key components: (a) selective visual
unlearning: employing inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual
representations from their original semantics, (b) cross-modal knowledge
retention: preserving other modalities' discriminability through semantic
consistency, and (c) dual-set contrastive separation: preserving the model
performance via isolation of structural perturbations between the unlearn set
and retain set; extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the
superiority of CCU, and our method achieves a 7.12% accuracy improvement with
only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical questions requiring both image and text understanding remain challenging in healthcare AI, needing improved accuracy and knowledge-based reasoning.

Method: Uses FFT to shift image/text features to frequency domain, then integrates quantum-inspired retrieval system to fetch medical facts from external sources using quantum similarity techniques.

Result: Outperforms earlier models on VQA-RAD dataset, especially on complex cases requiring image-text reasoning, with improved performance and explainability.

Conclusion: The combination of frequency processing and quantum information offers a promising approach for building intelligent, transparent AI tools for medical professionals.

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text
understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we
propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A continual learning framework for medical imaging that combines class-conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation to adapt foundation models over time without storing patient data, achieving near-joint training performance while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging foundation models need to adapt over time, but full retraining is often prevented by privacy constraints and high costs. There's a need for privacy-preserving continual learning approaches that don't require storing patient exemplars.

Method: Pairs class-conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) using a compact Vision Transformer backbone. The diffusion replay generates synthetic data to avoid storing real patient data, while EWC provides synaptic stability to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Achieved 0.851 AUROC on CheXpert, reduced forgetting by more than 30% compared to DER++, and approached joint training performance (0.869 AUROC). The method remains efficient and privacy-preserving while maintaining strong performance across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical route for scalable, privacy-aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models. Analysis shows forgetting is connected to replay fidelity and Fisher-weighted parameter drift, highlighting the complementary roles of diffusion replay and synaptic stability.

Abstract: Medical imaging foundation models must adapt over time, yet full retraining
is often blocked by privacy constraints and cost. We present a continual
learning framework that avoids storing patient exemplars by pairing class
conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation. Using a compact
Vision Transformer backbone, we evaluate across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and
CheXpert. On CheXpert our approach attains 0.851 AUROC, reduces forgetting by
more than 30\% relative to DER\texttt{++}, and approaches joint training at
0.869 AUROC, while remaining efficient and privacy preserving. Analyses connect
forgetting to two measurable factors: fidelity of replay and Fisher weighted
parameter drift, highlighting the complementary roles of replay diffusion and
synaptic stability. The results indicate a practical route for scalable,
privacy aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models.

TL;DR: Proposes FedDA framework for cross-domain medical image segmentation in federated learning, addressing modality heterogeneity through feature-level adversarial learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical data imbalance and modality differences across clients create challenges for federated learning in healthcare, requiring solutions for cross-domain segmentation.

Method: Feature-level adversarial learning that aligns feature maps across clients through adversarial training mechanism to enhance generalization across domains.

Result: FedDA achieves cross-domain federated aggregation, enables single modality clients to process cross-modality data, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in objective and subjective assessments.

Conclusion: The proposed FedDA framework effectively addresses modality heterogeneity in federated medical image segmentation and demonstrates robust performance across multiple domains.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models
among different clients while ensuring data privacy, emerging as the mainstream
for breaking data silos in the healthcare domain. However, the imbalance of
medical resources, data corruption or improper data preservation may lead to a
situation where different clients possess medical images of different modality.
This heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for cross-domain medical image
segmentation within the federated learning framework. To address this
challenge, we propose a new Federated Domain Adaptation (FedDA) segmentation
training framework. Specifically, we propose a feature-level adversarial
learning among clients by aligning feature maps across clients through
embedding an adversarial training mechanism. This design can enhance the
model's generalization on multiple domains and alleviate the negative impact
from domain-shift. Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets
demonstrate that our proposed FedDA substantially achieves cross-domain
federated aggregation, endowing single modality client with cross-modality
processing capabilities, and consistently delivers robust performance compared
to state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms in objective and
subjective assessment. Our code are available at

Result: EditScore matches performance of proprietary VLMs, with largest variant surpassing GPT-5 in benchmark. Enabled efficient and robust policy optimization for RL in image editing, showing substantial performance uplift when applied to OmniGen2 base model.

Conclusion: A high-fidelity, domain-specialized reward model is key to unlocking RL's full potential in image editing, providing the first systematic path from benchmarking to reward modeling to RL training in this domain.

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet
current models still face challenges with complex instructions and often
require multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been
severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In
this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier,
centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We
first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically
evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we
develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the
quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation
and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning
proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy
tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even
surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity
reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our
experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide
an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy
optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results
in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift.
Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to
reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity,
domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of
RL in this domain.

*Xiyan Xu,Sirui Xu,Yu-Xiong Wang,Liang-Yan Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoReact is a diffusion-based method for text-driven human reaction generation that disentangles global trajectory and local motion generation to produce realistic, diverse reactions that match counterpart movements and follow textual guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for human reaction generation either treat multiple individuals as a single entity or rely solely on one person's motion, failing to integrate rich semantic information and lacking adaptive responsiveness to diverse interaction scenarios.

Method: Proposes MoReact, a diffusion-based method that sequentially generates global trajectories first, then local motions, with a novel interaction loss to enhance realism of close interactions. Uses text descriptions of interaction scenarios to guide motion generation.

Result: Experiments using adapted two-person motion data demonstrate the approach produces realistic, diverse, and controllable reactions that closely match counterpart movements while adhering to textual guidance.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses limitations of existing models by focusing on text-driven human reaction generation, achieving better alignment with given actions and text through sequential generation of trajectories and motions.

Abstract: Modeling and generating human reactions poses a significant challenge with
broad applications for computer vision and human-computer interaction. Existing
methods either treat multiple individuals as a single entity, directly
generating interactions, or rely solely on one person's motion to generate the
other's reaction, failing to integrate the rich semantic information that
underpins human interactions. Yet, these methods often fall short in adaptive
responsiveness, i.e., the ability to accurately respond to diverse and dynamic
interaction scenarios. Recognizing this gap, our work introduces an approach
tailored to address the limitations of existing models by focusing on
text-driven human reaction generation. Our model specifically generates
realistic motion sequences for individuals that responding to the other's
actions based on a descriptive text of the interaction scenario. The goal is to
produce motion sequences that not only complement the opponent's movements but
also semantically fit the described interactions. To achieve this, we present
MoReact, a diffusion-based method designed to disentangle the generation of
global trajectories and local motions sequentially. This approach stems from
the observation that generating global trajectories first is crucial for
guiding local motion, ensuring better alignment with given action and text.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction loss to enhance the realism of
generated close interactions. Our experiments, utilizing data adapted from a
two-person motion dataset, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for this
novel task, which is capable of producing realistic, diverse, and controllable
reactions that not only closely match the movements of the counterpart but also
adhere to the textual guidance. Please find our webpage at

*Yihang Guo,Tianyuan Yu,Liang Bai,Yanming Guo,Yirun Ruan,William Li,Weishi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-task learning suffers from optimization imbalance where task interference reduces performance. This paper identifies gradient norm correlation with imbalance and shows scaling losses by gradient norms achieves results comparable to expensive grid search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze the persistent problem of unbalanced optimization in multi-task learning, where task interference leads to subpar performance compared to single-task models.

Method: Conducted systematic experimental analysis to dissect factors contributing to optimization imbalance, investigated existing optimization methods across datasets, and analyzed gradient dynamics and norms.

Result: Found strong correlation between optimization imbalance and task-specific gradient norms, demonstrated that scaling task losses according to gradient norms achieves performance comparable to computationally expensive grid search.

Conclusion: Understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a more direct path to stable multi-task learning than developing increasingly complex methods.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to build general-purpose vision systems by
training a single network to perform multiple tasks jointly. While promising,
its potential is often hindered by "unbalanced optimization", where task
interference leads to subpar performance compared to single-task models. To
facilitate research in MTL, this paper presents a systematic experimental
analysis to dissect the factors contributing to this persistent problem. Our
investigation confirms that the performance of existing optimization methods
varies inconsistently across datasets, and advanced architectures still rely on
costly grid-searched loss weights. Furthermore, we show that while powerful
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong initialization, they do not
inherently resolve the optimization imbalance, and merely increasing data
quantity offers limited benefits. A crucial finding emerges from our analysis:
a strong correlation exists between the optimization imbalance and the norm of
task-specific gradients. We demonstrate that this insight is directly
applicable, showing that a straightforward strategy of scaling task losses
according to their gradient norms can achieve performance comparable to that of
an extensive and computationally expensive grid search. Our comprehensive
analysis suggests that understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a
more direct path to stable MTL than developing increasingly complex methods.

*Kuanrong Liu,Siyuan Liang,Cheng Qian,Ming Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes adversarial example transfer across CLIP-based models in different tasks, finding that fine-grained tasks generate more transferable attacks. The authors propose MT-AdvCLIP framework that improves cross-task attack success rates by 39% without increasing perturbation budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with fine-grained tasks like object detection and segmentation, and its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored. Understanding adversarial transfer across tasks is crucial for assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks.

Method: Proposed Multi-Task Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP) with task-aware feature aggregation loss that generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task generalization capability, strengthening attack effectiveness of fine-grained task models on shared CLIP backbone.

Result: MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves adversarial transfer success rate by over 39% on average across multiple tasks against various CLIP-derived models, without increasing perturbation budget.

Conclusion: The study reveals adversarial example transfer mechanisms in multi-task CLIP models and provides new insights for multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.

Abstract: As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates
strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely
adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text
retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object
detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on
these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored.
Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to
assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we
conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of
CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic
segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples
generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic
segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from
coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP
model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task
Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature
aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task
generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of
fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on
multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the
adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across
multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models,
without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer
mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new
insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.

### [179] [Token Painter: Training-Free Text-Guided Image Inpainting via Mask Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23919)
*Longtao Jiang,Mingfei Han,Lei Chen,Yongqiang Yu,Feng Zhao,Xiaojun Chang,Zhihui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Token Painter is a training-free text-guided image inpainting method using Mask AutoRegressive models that addresses background consistency and text alignment issues through dual-stream fusion and adaptive attention enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based methods struggle with text alignment and background consistency in image inpainting due to modeling the entire image in latent space. MAR models offer better local controllability but face challenges with prompt adherence and background harmony.

Method: Proposes Token Painter with two key components: Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF) for semantic and context fusion in frequency domain, and Adaptive Decoder Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE) for enhanced attention on guidance and inpainting tokens.

Result: Outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Token Painter provides an effective training-free solution for text-guided image inpainting that achieves better text alignment and background consistency than existing methods.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims to inpaint masked image regions based on a
textual prompt while preserving the background. Although diffusion-based
methods have become dominant, their property of modeling the entire image in
latent space makes it challenging for the results to align well with prompt
details and maintain a consistent background. To address these issues, we
explore Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models for this task. MAR naturally supports
image inpainting by generating latent tokens corresponding to mask regions,
enabling better local controllability without altering the background. However,
directly applying MAR to this task makes the inpainting content either ignore
the prompts or be disharmonious with the background context. Through analysis
of the attention maps from the inpainting images, we identify the impact of
background tokens on text tokens during the MAR generation, and leverage this
to design \textbf{Token Painter}, a training-free text-guided image inpainting
method based on MAR. Our approach introduces two key components: (1)
Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF), which fuses the semantic and
context information from text and background in frequency domain to produce
novel guidance tokens, allowing MAR to generate text-faithful inpainting
content while keeping harmonious with background context. (2) Adaptive Decoder
Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE), which adaptively enhances attention scores on
guidance tokens and inpainting tokens to further enhance the alignment of
prompt details and the content visual quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results. Codes
will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A closed-loop evaluation framework for autonomous driving that integrates real-world traffic scenarios into CARLA simulator using infrastructure sensors and digital twins of real intersections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CARLA benchmarks use manually configured traffic scenarios that diverge from real-world conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance.

Method: Extracted 800 dynamic traffic scenarios from 100-hour video dataset captured by infrastructure sensors, and created static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent visual appearance in CARLA simulator.

Result: Created a challenging closed-loop evaluation framework that accurately replicates real-world traffic and environmental characteristics, enabling more realistic simulations.

Conclusion: The framework provides a comprehensive closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models with improved realism through infrastructure cooperation and digital twin technology.

Abstract: Closed-loop evaluation is increasingly critical for end-to-end autonomous
driving. Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on
manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world
conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To
address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop
evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into
the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves
extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour
video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating
static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent
visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and
environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more
realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the
diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day
at complex urban intersections. In addition, we provide a comprehensive
closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models.

*Alexandros Doumanoglou,Kurt Driessens,Dimitrios Zarpalas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to recover encoding-decoding direction pairs in deep vision networks, where concepts are represented as directions in latent space, enabling model understanding, debugging, and correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To open the black box of deep networks by recovering encoding and decoding directions that represent concepts, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models through concept unlearning and intervention.

Method: Identifies decoding directions via directional clustering of activations, estimates encoding directions with signal vectors under a probabilistic view, and leverages network weights through Uncertainty Region Alignment to reveal interpretable directions.

Result: On synthetic data, recovers ground-truth direction pairs; on real data, decoding directions map to monosemantic interpretable concepts and outperform unsupervised baselines; signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding directions validated via activation maximization.

Conclusion: The method enables applications in understanding global model behavior, explaining individual predictions, and intervening to produce counterfactuals or correct errors, providing a framework for interpretable deep network analysis.

Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that deep vision networks represent concepts as
directions in latent space, vectors we call concept embeddings. Each concept
has a latent factor-a scalar-indicating its presence in an input patch. For a
given patch, multiple latent factors are encoded into a compact representation
by linearly combining concept embeddings, with the factors as coefficients.
Since these embeddings enable such encoding, we call them encoding directions.
A latent factor can be recovered via the inner product with a filter, a vector
we call a decoding direction. These encoding-decoding direction pairs are not
directly accessible, but recovering them helps open the black box of deep
networks, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models. Decoder
directions attribute meaning to latent codes, while encoding directions assess
concept influence on predictions, with both enabling model correction by
unlearning irrelevant concepts. Unlike prior matrix decomposition, autoencoder,
or dictionary learning methods that rely on feature reconstruction, we propose
a new perspective: decoding directions are identified via directional
clustering of activations, and encoding directions are estimated with signal
vectors under a probabilistic view. We further leverage network weights through
a novel technique, Uncertainty Region Alignment, which reveals interpretable
directions affecting predictions. Our analysis shows that (a) on synthetic
data, our method recovers ground-truth direction pairs; (b) on real data,
decoding directions map to monosemantic, interpretable concepts and outperform
unsupervised baselines; and (c) signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding
directions, validated via activation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate
applications in understanding global model behavior, explaining individual
predictions, and intervening to produce counterfactuals or correct errors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAR-KnowLIP is the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model that addresses the gap in cross-modal AI for synthetic aperture radar imagery by incorporating geographic information, hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought text generation, and self-consistent iterative optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-modal AI methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a significant gap in modeling SAR imagery despite its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities that are crucial for remote sensing scene understanding.

Method: The approach includes: (1) constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M dataset with geographic projection properties; (2) generating aligned structured text via hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought; (3) implementing self-consistent iterative optimization with contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning; (4) establishing unified evaluation benchmark across 11 downstream tasks.

Result: SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading performance across 11 representative downstream tasks when compared against 14 leading foundation models, particularly excelling in object counting and land-cover classification.

Conclusion: SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark are expected to significantly advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.

Abstract: Cross-modal artificial intelligence has garnered widespread attention in
recent years, achieving significant progress in the study of natural images.
However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a
significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with
its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in
remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes
SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with
reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces
the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into
remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR
dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple
satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured
text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT),
providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of
landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships.
(3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that
continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed
loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable
multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11
representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons
against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading
performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We
expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model
architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly
advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.

### [183] [AutoPrune: Each Complexity Deserves a Pruning Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23931)
*Hanshi Wang,Yuhao Xu,Zekun Xu,Jin Gao,Yufan Liu,Weiming Hu,Ke Wang,Zhipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoPrune is a training-free framework that adaptively prunes visual tokens in vision-language models based on sample and task complexity, achieving 89% token reduction and 76.8% FLOPs reduction while maintaining 96.7% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods use fixed, heuristic strategies that don't align with the model's reasoning trajectory, failing to accommodate diverse input complexities. Human visual processing shows evidence accumulation followed by focused attention, suggesting adaptive pruning is needed.

Method: AutoPrune quantifies mutual information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each curve's unique shape corresponds to specific task complexity and guarantees computational constraints.

Result: Applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B, AutoPrune prunes 89% of visual tokens, reduces inference FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% original accuracy across all tasks. Outperforms PDrop by 9.1% improvement.

Conclusion: Complexity-adaptive pruning effectively reduces computational demands while maintaining performance, demonstrating the importance of aligning token elimination with the model's reasoning trajectory rather than using fixed pruning schedules.

Abstract: The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language
models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational
demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning
strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across
decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to
all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the
model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human
visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence
before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal
an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a
fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally
accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a
training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying
sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual
information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a
budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined
by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks
and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We
evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on
Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference
FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all
tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop,
demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automatic car damage detection pipeline that performs 3D damage segmentation by lifting 2D masks and proposes a learning-free approach for single-view 3D Gaussian Splatting segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic car damage detection is important for the auto insurance industry, but existing methods mostly use 2D image analysis. 3D reconstruction methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting can provide more comprehensive and geometrically accurate damage representations, especially for challenging cases where damage is only visible in single views.

Method: The pipeline performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Uses a learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS segmentation where Gaussians are projected onto image plane using SfM camera parameters, then filtered using Z-buffering with a normal distribution model of depth and opacities.

Result: The method is particularly effective for challenging car damage detection scenarios where target objects like scratches and small dents may only be clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches impractical.

Conclusion: The proposed learning-free single-view 3D Gaussian Splatting segmentation approach enables effective car damage detection in challenging scenarios where damage is only visible from limited viewpoints.

Abstract: Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for
the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective
damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to
leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more
comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage.
Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis,
particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to
generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of
views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline
that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we
propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS
segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using
camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then
filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal
distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that
this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage
detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be
clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches
impractical or impossible. The code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: ColLab enables fully automated, high-quality REC and REG data generation without human supervision, addressing scalability limitations of manual annotation.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation
(REG) are fundamental tasks in multimodal understanding, supporting precise
object localization through natural language. However, existing REC and REG
datasets rely heavily on manual annotation, which is labor-intensive and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose ColLab, a collaborative spatial

module termed Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to enhance spatial
expressiveness among duplicate instances. Experiments demonstrate that ColLab
significantly accelerates the annotation process of REC and REG while improving
the quality and discriminability of the generated expressions. In addition to
the core methodological contribution, our framework was partially adopted in

Motivation: Current video world models have improved visual quality but struggle with accurately modeling human-specified actions. Traditional reinforcement learning methods are impractical due to high annotation costs and difficulty in constructing video verifiers.

Method: Proposes RLIR framework that uses an Inverse Dynamics Model to recover input actions from generated videos, mapping high-dimensional video to low-dimensional action space for verifiable reward signals, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: Experiments show 5-10% improvements in action-following, up to 10% gains in visual quality, and higher human preference scores across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms.

Conclusion: RLIR is the first post-training method specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models, providing an effective solution to the action-following problem without requiring expensive preference annotations.

Abstract: World models simulate dynamic environments, enabling agents to interact with
diverse input modalities. Although recent advances have improved the visual
quality and temporal consistency of video world models, their ability of
accurately modeling human-specified actions remains under-explored.
Reinforcement learning presents a promising approach for directly improving the
suboptimal action-following capability of pre-trained models, assuming that an
appropriate reward function can be defined. However, transferring reinforcement
learning post-training methods to world model is impractical due to the
prohibitive cost of large-scale preference annotations and the infeasibility of
constructing rule-based video verifiers. To address this gap, we propose
Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards (RLIR), a post-training framework
that derives verifiable reward signals by recovering input actions from
generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model. By mapping high-dimensional
video modality to a low-dimensional action space, RLIR provides an objective
and verifiable reward for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experiments across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms demonstrate 5-10%
gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher
human preference scores, establishing RLIR as the first post-training method
specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models.

TL;DR: An intelligent thyroid cancer classification method combining adaptive CNN with CDF9/7 wavelets modulated by chaotic system achieves 98.17% accuracy on ultrasound images, outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective thyroid cancer treatment and improved patient outcomes, addressing the global rise in thyroid cancer cases.

Method: Couples an Adaptive CNN with CDF9/7 wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll chaotic system to enrich discriminative features. Evaluated on DDTI dataset using 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: Achieves 98.17% accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, and AUC of 0.9912. Outperforms EfficientNetV2-S, Swin-T, ViT-B/16, and ConvNeXt-T. Chaotic modulation improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points. Computationally efficient (28.7 ms per image).

Conclusion: The wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization and practical runtime characteristics suitable for clinical integration.

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial in addressing the global rise in
thyroid cancer, ensuring effective treatment strategies and improved patient
outcomes. We present an intelligent classification method that couples an
Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau
(CDF9/7) wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll
chaotic system to enrich discriminative features. We evaluate on the public
DDTI thyroid ultrasound dataset (n = 1,638 images; 819 malignant / 819 benign)
using 5-fold cross-validation, where the proposed method attains 98.17%
accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, and an AUC
of 0.9912. A controlled ablation shows that adding chaotic modulation to CDF9/7
improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points over a CDF9/7-only CNN (from
89.38% to 98.17%). To objectively position our approach, we trained
state-of-the-art backbones on the same data and splits: EfficientNetV2-S
(96.58% accuracy; AUC 0.987), Swin-T (96.41%; 0.986), ViT-B/16 (95.72%; 0.983),
and ConvNeXt-T (96.94%; 0.987). Our method outperforms the best of these by
+1.23 points in accuracy and +0.0042 in AUC, while remaining computationally
efficient (28.7 ms per image; 1,125 MB peak VRAM). Robustness is further
supported by cross-dataset testing on TCIA (accuracy 95.82%) and transfer to an
ISIC skin-lesion subset (n = 28 unique images, augmented to 2,048; accuracy
97.31%). Explainability analyses (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) highlight clinically
relevant regions. Altogether, the wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers
state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization
and practical runtime characteristics suitable for clinical integration.

*Kargi Chauhan,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFSI enforces physical constraints in traffic simulation models through energy-based guidance during diffusion sampling, reducing collisions by 67% and improving validity by 87% without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for traffic simulation systematically violate physical constraints, with 50% of trajectories showing collisions, off-road driving, and impossible vehicle spawns, treating physical validity as emergent rather than required.

Method: Proposed Validity-First Spatial Intelligence (VFSI) uses energy-based guidance during diffusion sampling to enforce collision avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, guiding denoising toward physically valid trajectories without model retraining.

Result: Across 200 urban scenarios, VFSI reduced collision rates from 24.6% to 8.1% (67% reduction) and improved overall validity from 50.3% to 94.2% (87% improvement), while also improving realism metrics (ADE from 1.34m to 1.21m).

Conclusion: Explicit constraint enforcement during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic simulation, demonstrating that model-agnostic approaches can achieve high validity without architectural changes.

Abstract: Modern diffusion models generate realistic traffic simulations but
systematically violate physical constraints. In a large-scale evaluation of
SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of
generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive
off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation:
current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an
architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence
(VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during
diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision
avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising
process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from
the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to
8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while
simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our
model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement
during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic
simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly adapting generative diffusion models to video super-resolution results in redundancy since low-quality videos already preserve substantial content information, leading to increased computational overhead and learning burden.

Method: Proposes attention specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns according to their intrinsic behaviors, and a progressive training strategy starting with temporally consistent degradations then shifting to inconsistent settings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with 6.2× speedup over one-step diffusion baselines like SeedVR2.

Conclusion: OASIS effectively mitigates redundancy in diffusion models for VSR while preserving pretrained knowledge, enabling better adaptation to video super-resolution tasks with superior efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promising results for video
super-resolution (VSR). However, directly adapting generative diffusion models
to VSR can result in redundancy, since low-quality videos already preserve
substantial content information. Such redundancy leads to increased
computational overhead and learning burden, as the model performs superfluous
operations and must learn to filter out irrelevant information. To address this
problem, we propose OASIS, an efficient $\textbf{o}$ne-step diffusion model
with $\textbf{a}$ttention $\textbf{s}$pecialization for real-world
v$\textbf{i}$deo $\textbf{s}$uper-resolution. OASIS incorporates an attention
specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns
according to their intrinsic behaviors. This routing mitigates redundancy while
effectively preserving pretrained knowledge, allowing diffusion models to
better adapt to VSR and achieve stronger performance. Moreover, we propose a
simple yet effective progressive training strategy, which starts with
temporally consistent degradations and then shifts to inconsistent settings.
This strategy facilitates learning under complex degradations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that OASIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both synthetic and real-world datasets. OASIS also provides superior inference
speed, offering a $\textbf{6.2$\times$}$ speedup over one-step diffusion
baselines such as SeedVR2. The code will be available at

TL;DR: RPG360 is a training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that uses perspective foundation models and graph optimization to achieve depth scale consistency across cubemap faces without requiring labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has created a need for robust depth estimation techniques, but obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth estimation remains a significant challenge.

Method: Converts 360 images into six-face cubemap representations, employs perspective foundation models to estimate depth and surface normals, and introduces graph-based optimization with per-face scale parameters to ensure depth scale consistency across cubemap faces.

Result: Achieves superior performance across diverse datasets (Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, 360Loc) and demonstrates benefits in downstream tasks: feature matching (3.2-5.4% improvement) and Structure from Motion (0.2-9.7% improvement in AUC@5).

Conclusion: The proposed RPG360 method effectively addresses depth scale inconsistencies in 360 images using foundation models and graph optimization, achieving robust performance without requiring training on labeled datasets.

Abstract: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has emphasized the
need for robust depth estimation techniques tailored for omnidirectional
images. However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth
estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a
training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages
perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360
images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation
model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale
inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel
depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which
parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an
additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale
consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural
integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in
zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse
datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate
the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in
downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion
0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with overall realism meta score of 0.7858 on Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge, ranking first on the leaderboard.

Conclusion: The simple yet powerful R1-style training framework effectively enhances foundation models for multi-agent traffic simulation, addressing distributional shift and improving alignment with human preferences.

Abstract: Scalable and realistic simulation of multi-agent traffic behavior is critical
for advancing autonomous driving technologies. Although existing data-driven
simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly
rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world
driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional
shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model
generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose
SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for
next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human
preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented
policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an
iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance
gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset
(WOMD) validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful R1-style training
framework in enhancing foundation models. The results on the Waymo Open Sim

Conclusion: TREAT-Net shows potential as a non-invasive tool for timely ACS patient triage, especially beneficial for underserved populations with limited angiography access.

Abstract: Coronary angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosing Acute Coronary

patients to procedural risks and diagnostic delays, leading to postponed
treatment initiation. In this work, we introduce TREAT-Net, a multimodal deep
learning framework for ACS treatment prediction that leverages non-invasive
modalities, including echocardiography videos and structured clinical records.
TREAT-Net integrates tabular-guided cross-attention to enhance video
interpretation, along with a late fusion mechanism to align predictions across
modalities. Trained on a dataset of over 9000 ACS cases, the model outperforms
unimodal and non-fused baselines, achieving a balanced accuracy of 67.6% and an
AUROC of 71.1%. Cross-modality agreement analysis demonstrates 88.6% accuracy
for intervention prediction. These findings highlight the potential of
TREAT-Net as a non-invasive tool for timely and accurate patient triage,
particularly in underserved populations with limited access to coronary
angiography.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D head avatar generation lack fine-grained, intuitive control over expressions via text, making it challenging to create expressive avatars from single images.

Method: SIE3D fuses identity features from images with semantic embeddings from text through a novel conditioning scheme, and introduces a perceptual expression loss function using a pre-trained expression classifier to regularize generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show SIE3D significantly improves controllability and realism, outperforming competitive methods in identity preservation and expression fidelity while running on a single consumer-grade GPU.

Conclusion: SIE3D successfully enables detailed text-based control over 3D avatar expressions while maintaining high fidelity and identity preservation from single images.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D head avatars from a single image is challenging,
as current methods lack fine-grained, intuitive control over expressions via

TL;DR: FrameMind is a reinforcement learning framework that enables dynamic frame sampling for video understanding, allowing models to adaptively request visual information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video understanding models use fixed frame sampling strategies that cannot adapt to specific reasoning requirements, limiting performance on tasks needing either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail.

Method: FrameMind uses Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (FiCOT) for multi-turn reasoning, alternating between textual reasoning and active visual perception. It employs Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS) and DRFS-GRPO policy optimization to learn effective dynamic sampling policies without frame-level annotations.

Result: Extensive experiments on MLVU and VideoMME benchmarks show FrameMind significantly outperforms existing models and advances state-of-the-art in flexible and efficient video understanding.

Conclusion: FrameMind demonstrates that dynamic, adaptive frame sampling through reinforcement learning enables more effective video understanding compared to static sampling approaches.

Abstract: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies,
processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning
requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to
adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks
that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In
this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with
reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual
information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought
(FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns
where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual
perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on
identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we
propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to
diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a
group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based
rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in
flexible and efficient video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes the first generalized category discovery (GCD) framework specifically designed for hyperspectral images (HSI), using prototype subspace modeling instead of single prototype vectors to better capture complex spectral structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods mainly focus on RGB images and don't generalize well to hyperspectral images, which are high-dimensional with complex spectral structures that require specialized modeling approaches.

Method: The method models each category using a set of basis vectors forming a subspace representation, with two key constraints: basis orthogonality for inter-class separability and reconstruction constraint to ensure bases can effectively reconstruct class samples.

Result: Experimental results on real-world HSI demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD methods.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in hyperspectral settings by effectively handling the unique challenges of HSI data through subspace modeling.

Abstract: Generalized category discovery~(GCD) seeks to jointly identify both known and
novel categories in unlabeled data. While prior works have mainly focused on
RGB images, their assumptions and modeling strategies do not generalize well to
hyperspectral images~(HSI), which are inherently high-dimensional and exhibit
complex spectral structures. In this paper, we propose the first GCD framework
tailored for HSI, introducing a prototype subspace modeling model to better
capture class structure. Instead of learning a single prototype vector for each
category as in existing methods such as SimGCD, we model each category using a
set of basis vectors, forming a subspace representation that enables greater
expressiveness and discrimination in a high-dimensional feature space. To guide
the learning of such bases, we enforce two key constraints: (1) a basis
orthogonality constraint that promotes inter-class separability, and (2) a
reconstruction constraint that ensures each prototype basis can effectively
reconstruct its corresponding class samples. Experimental results on real-world
HSI demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD
methods, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in
hyperspectral settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address physical information degradation and ineffective pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy weather conditions.

Method: Combines differentiable atmospheric scattering model for haze mitigation, adaptive Mamba variant for feature extraction, and heterogeneous graph attention network with spatio-temporal fusion for pedestrian relationship modeling.

Result: 37.2% reduction in minADE and 41.5% reduction in minFDE compared to SOTA models in dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), with 78% inference speed increase over native Mamba.

Conclusion: Provides a new modeling paradigm for reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse environments.

Abstract: To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective
pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy
weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical
priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian
relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric
scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation
through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of
haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning
state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a
78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range
dependency modeling.
  Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a
heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model
multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a
spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns
of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian
trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE /
minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in
dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for
reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse
environments.

TL;DR: Learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior image reconstruction compared to post-ISP sRGB images, as demonstrated through rain removal tasks using a new benchmark dataset and evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, which irreversibly mix colors, clip dynamic range, and blur fine detail. The paper aims to show these losses are avoidable by working directly with raw Bayer data.

Method: Evaluated post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction pipelines, curated Raw-Rain benchmark (first public dataset of real rainy scenes in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB), introduced Information Conservation Score (ICS) metric, and developed raw-domain model.

Result: Raw-domain model improved sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2% ICS on test split, while running faster with half the GFLOPs compared to post-ISP approaches.

Conclusion: Results advocate for an ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and open the door to end-to-end learnable camera pipelines by demonstrating superior performance when learning directly on raw Bayer data.

Abstract: Image reconstruction from corrupted images is crucial across many domains.
Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, even though
the image-signal-processing pipeline irreversibly mixes colors, clips dynamic
range, and blurs fine detail. This paper uses the rain degradation problem as a
use case to show that these losses are avoidable, and demonstrates that
learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior reconstructions. To
substantiate the claim, we (i) evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction
pipelines, (ii) curate Raw-Rain, the first public benchmark of real rainy
scenes captured in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB, and (iii)
introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS), a color-invariant metric that
aligns more closely with human opinion than PSNR or SSIM. On the test split,
our raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2%
ICS, while running faster with half of the GFLOPs. The results advocate an
ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and open the door to end-to-end
learnable camera pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering for hyperspectral images using a feedback mechanism between self-representation and differentiable superpixel modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing superpixel-based subspace clustering methods where segmentation is performed independently, leading to partitions that don't align with clustering objectives and poor scalability due to high computational costs.

Method: Unified framework with joint optimization of superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering using a feedback mechanism: self-representation network based on unfolded ADMM guides a differentiable superpixel module, with learnable compactness parameters for each superpixel.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets show superior clustering accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, with clustering-aware partitions that preserve spectral and spatial structure.

Conclusion: The joint optimization approach effectively addresses the misalignment between segmentation and clustering, enabling more flexible and adaptive superpixel segmentation while achieving better clustering performance for hyperspectral image analysis.

Abstract: Subspace clustering is a powerful unsupervised approach for hyperspectral
image (HSI) analysis, but its high computational and memory costs limit
scalability. Superpixel segmentation can improve efficiency by reducing the
number of data points to process. However, existing superpixel-based methods
usually perform segmentation independently of the clustering task, often
producing partitions that do not align with the subsequent clustering
objective. To address this, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that
jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering. Its core is
a feedback mechanism: a self-representation network based on unfolded
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) provides a model-driven
signal to guide a differentiable superpixel module. This joint optimization
yields clustering-aware partitions that preserve both spectral and spatial
structure. Furthermore, our superpixel network learns a unique compactness
parameter for each superpixel, enabling more flexible and adaptive
segmentation. Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves superior accuracy compared with

### [201] [A Second-Order Perspective on Pruning at Initialization and Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24066)
*Leonardo Iurada,Beatrice Occhiena,Tatiana Tommasi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pruning pre-trained vision models on one task maintains zero-shot performance on unseen tasks, and fine-tuning recovers performance on held-out tasks due to favorable loss landscapes from pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of pruning pre-trained vision models when downstream tasks are unknown, investigating how data influences pruning and whether task-specific data is always necessary.

Method: Pruning-at-Initialization approach applied to pre-trained vision models, testing pruning on one task and evaluating zero-shot performance on unseen tasks, followed by fine-tuning.

Result: Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains zero-shot performance on unseen tasks, and fine-tuning these pruned models recovers performance on held-out tasks.

Conclusion: Extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets creates favorable loss landscapes that enable effective pruning without requiring task-specific data, making pruning more practical for unknown downstream tasks.

Abstract: The widespread availability of pre-trained vision models has enabled numerous
deep learning applications through their transferable representations. However,
their computational and storage costs often limit practical deployment.
Pruning-at-Initialization has emerged as a promising approach to compress
models before training, enabling efficient task-specific adaptation. While
conventional wisdom suggests that effective pruning requires task-specific
data, this creates a challenge when downstream tasks are unknown in advance. In
this paper, we investigate how data influences the pruning of pre-trained
vision models. Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains the model's zero-shot
performance also on unseen tasks. Furthermore, fine-tuning these pruned models
not only improves performance on original seen tasks but can recover held-out
tasks' performance. We attribute this phenomenon to the favorable loss
landscapes induced by extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets.

### [202] [Uncovering Grounding IDs: How External Cues Shape Multi-Modal Binding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24072)
*Hosein Hasani,Amirmohammad Izadi,Fatemeh Askari,Mobin Bagherian,Sadegh Mohammadian,Mohammad Izadi,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Grounding IDs are latent identifiers that emerge from external visual cues, improving multimodal binding by reducing modality gaps and strengthening attention between related components in vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why simple visual structures like partitions and annotations improve LVLM performance, and to uncover the internal mechanisms behind these gains in structured reasoning and precise grounding.

Method: Used representation analysis to study latent identifiers (Grounding IDs) induced by external cues, performed causal interventions to verify their role in binding objects to partitions, and analyzed embedding space alignment and modality gaps.

Result: Found that Grounding IDs emerge as robust within-partition alignment, reduce modality gap between image and text, mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues, strengthen attention between related components, and improve cross-modal grounding while reducing hallucinations.

Conclusion: Grounding IDs are a key symbolic mechanism that explains how external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and practical improvements in robustness for vision-language models.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show strong performance across
multimodal benchmarks but remain limited in structured reasoning and precise
grounding. Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures,
such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal
mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this
phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced
by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across
modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers
emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the
modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that
these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show
that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in
turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together,
our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how
external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and
practical improvements in robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAR challenges the frame-by-frame approach in video generation by proposing spatiotemporal cubes as prediction units, enabling simultaneous spatial and temporal modeling and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper questions whether frames are the appropriate atomic units for video autoregression, as opposed to the universally agreed word tokens in language modeling.

Method: VideoAR is a unified framework supporting multiple prediction units including full frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes, with cube-based prediction operating across both spatial and temporal dimensions.

Result: Cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior quality, speed, and temporal coherence, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines on VBench with faster inference and scaling to minute-long sequences.

Conclusion: The work motivates rethinking sequence decomposition in video and other spatiotemporal domains by removing the frame-by-frame constraint in autoregressive video generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive models for video generation typically operate frame-by-frame,
extending next-token prediction from language to video's temporal dimension. We
question that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frame
is a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, a
unified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including full
frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes.
Among these designs, we find model video generation using
\textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressive
models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.
This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomic
units for video autoregression. We evaluate VideoAR across diverse prediction
strategies, finding that cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior
quality, speed, and temporal coherence. By removing the frame-by-frame
constraint, our video generator surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench
while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long
sequences. We hope this work will motivate rethinking sequence decomposition in
video and other spatiotemporal domains.

Method: Uses rectified flow for deterministic straight-line sampling paths between noise and data, employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with music features and LLM-based text decompositions, and incorporates contrastive objective and synchronization loss for better alignment and coordination.

Result: Extensive evaluations show consistent gains in motion quality, responsiveness, and efficiency across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and multi-modal interactive benchmarks, producing temporally coherent and rhythmically synchronized motions.

Conclusion: DualFlow sets state-of-the-art in multi-modal human motion generation by effectively combining efficient sampling, semantic grounding, and inter-person coordination techniques.

Abstract: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse
modalities remains a central challenge in computer graphics, animation, and
human-computer interaction. We introduce DualFlow, a unified and efficient
framework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D
motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion
sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line
sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating
error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic
grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that
retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text
decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We
use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning
signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person
coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and
multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality,
responsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and
rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal
human motion generation.

Motivation: Current RVOS methods using MLLMs face challenges including insufficient exploitation of prior knowledge, high computational costs for long videos, and inadequate handling of complex temporal dynamics.

Method: SVAC incorporates Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal Compression (ASTC) to compress visual tokens while preserving spatio-temporal structure, and Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA) strategy to handle dynamic object behaviors across video clips.

Result: SVAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed SVAC model effectively addresses key challenges in RVOS by scaling up inputs while maintaining computational efficiency through compression and dynamic allocation strategies.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects in
video sequences based on natural language descriptions. While recent advances
in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved RVOS performance
through enhanced text-video understanding, several challenges remain, including
insufficient exploitation of MLLMs' prior knowledge, prohibitive computational

temporal dynamics. In this work, we propose SVAC, a unified model that improves
RVOS by scaling up input frames and segmentation tokens to enhance
video-language interaction and segmentation precision. To address the resulting
computational challenges, SVAC incorporates the Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal
Compression (ASTC) module to compress visual tokens while preserving essential
spatio-temporal structure. Moreover, the Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA)
strategy is introduced to better handle dynamic object behaviors across video
clips. Experimental results demonstrate that SVAC achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency. Our code

*Zhecheng Li,Guoxian Song,Yiwei Wang,Zhen Xiong,Junsong Yuan,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMS is a coarse-to-fine framework that combines general vision-language models (Scanner) with specialized GUI grounding models (Locator) to improve GUI grounding performance, achieving 35.7% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI grounding requires understanding diverse UI elements and predicting precise spatial coordinates, which is challenging for single models. The framework aims to mimic human behavior where eyes scan broadly and brain focuses on localization.

Method: GMS uses a synergistic framework with five stages: general VLM as 'Scanner' identifies potential regions, and fine-tuned grounding model as 'Locator' outputs precise coordinates within those regions. Incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication.

Result: Individual Scanner and Locator models achieve only 2.0% and 3.7% accuracy respectively, but their integration in GMS achieves 35.7% overall accuracy - a 10x improvement. Significantly outperforms other baselines in various settings.

Conclusion: GMS demonstrates robust performance for general-purpose GUI grounding by effectively leveraging complementary strengths of general and specialized models through a coarse-to-fine approach.

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI
elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately
predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation. To tackle this
problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a
synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding
performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general
vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by
assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general
VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the
fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise
coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform
GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on
interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages
and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve
promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro
dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$
and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration
within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10
\times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong
baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential
for general-purpose GUI grounding.

Motivation: To investigate and warn about AI's role in shaping aesthetic norms and to provide pathways toward equitable beauty technologies by examining ethnicity-based bias in AI facial beauty prediction systems.

Method: Comparative analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets using rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn analyses) and cross-dataset validation on the balanced FairFace dataset.

Result: Both models exhibited significant prediction disparities across ethnic groups (p < 0.001), with only 4.8-9.5% of inter-group comparisons satisfying distributional parity criteria, showing algorithmic amplification of societal beauty biases.

Conclusion: Current AI beauty prediction approaches are inadequate in addressing bias, and the findings underscore the need for mitigation strategies to develop more equitable beauty technologies.

Abstract: Bias can be introduced to AI systems even from seemingly balanced sources,
and AI facial beauty prediction is subject to ethnicity-based bias. This work
sounds warnings about AI's role in shaping aesthetic norms while providing
potential pathways toward equitable beauty technologies through comparative
analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets. Employing
rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn
analyses). It is demonstrated that both models exhibit significant prediction
disparities across ethnic groups $(p < 0.001)$, even when evaluated on the
balanced FairFace dataset. Cross-dataset validation shows algorithmic
amplification of societal beauty biases rather than mitigation based on
prediction and error parity. The findings underscore the inadequacy of current
AI beauty prediction approaches, with only 4.8-9.5\% of inter-group comparisons
satisfying distributional parity criteria. Mitigation strategies are proposed

Conclusion: FastVSR demonstrates substantial efficiency improvements in video super-resolution through compressed VAE design and stable training strategies, making diffusion models more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significant advantages in the field of real-world video
super-resolution and have demonstrated strong performance in past research. In
recent diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) models, the number of
sampling steps has been reduced to just one, yet there remains significant room
for further optimization in inference efficiency. In this paper, we propose
FastVSR, which achieves substantial reductions in computational cost by
implementing a high compression VAE (spatial compression ratio of 16, denoted
as f16). We design the structure of the f16 VAE and introduce a stable training
framework. We employ pixel shuffle and channel replication to achieve
additional upsampling. Furthermore, we propose a lower-bound-guided training
strategy, which introduces a simpler training objective as a lower bound for
the VAE's performance. It makes the training process more stable and easier to
converge. Experimental results show that FastVSR achieves speedups of 111.9
times compared to multi-step models and 3.92 times compared to existing
one-step models. We will release code and models at

TL;DR: LatXGen is a generative framework that synthesizes lateral spinal radiographs from posterior RGBD images, enabling radiation-free sagittal spinal alignment assessment for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current radiation-free methods focus mainly on coronal plane assessment, while reliable sagittal alignment evaluation without ionizing radiation remains underexplored, creating a gap in comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Method: Dual-stage architecture with attention-based Fast Fourier Convolution module for anatomical feature integration and Spatial Deformation Network for modeling lateral morphological variations, using 3,264 paired RGBD-radiograph dataset.

Result: LatXGen produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: The framework provides a promising radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal
deformity, and accurate morphological assessment requires evaluating both
coronal and sagittal alignment. While previous research has made significant
progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment,
reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing
radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose
LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal
radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed
backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal
alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal
morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface
geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the
radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that
progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding
radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based
Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from
RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model
morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the
first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and
lateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen
produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based
methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics. This study offers a
promising, radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances
comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Result: Experiments on medical image classification show improved distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model accuracy comparable to training on original datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of existing trajectory matching approaches for medical dataset distillation, achieving better performance with privacy preservation.

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces significant challenges in data sharing due to

Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset
distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states,

*Yinghao Jin,Xi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DECERN is a novel active learning method for fine-grained image classification that combines discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity to select the most informative samples under limited annotation budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In fine-grained image classification, assessing sample informativeness is challenging due to subtle inter-class differences, making traditional active learning methods less effective.

Method: DECERN uses a multifaceted informativeness measure combining discrepancy-confusion uncertainty (quantifying category directionality and structural stability) and calibration diversity (uncertainty-weighted clustering to maximize global diversity while maintaining local representativeness).

Result: Extensive experiments on 7 fine-grained image datasets across 26 experimental settings demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DECERN method effectively addresses the challenges of active learning in fine-grained image classification by combining uncertainty and diversity measures to select the most valuable samples.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to build high-quality labeled datasets by
iteratively selecting the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool under
limited annotation budgets. However, in fine-grained image classification,
assessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle
inter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active
fine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the
distinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value.
DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and
structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature
fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify
the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global
diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local
representativeness. Extensive experiments conducted on 7 fine-grained image
datasets across 26 distinct experimental settings demonstrate that our method
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: A tumor-generation model using radiomics features as conditions to generate diverse 3D medical images for CT and MRI across multiple organs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns and limited dataset availability in 3D medical imaging by creating diverse synthetic tumor images that accurately represent real medical images.

Method: Combines GAN-based tumor mask generation with diffusion-based texture generation, both conditioned on radiomics features (size, shape, texture) for user-specified tumor creation.

Result: Successfully generates diverse tumor images in four organs (kidney, lung, breast, brain) across CT and MRI, aiding downstream task training and validated by expert evaluations.

Conclusion: The method enables flexible tumor manipulation and generation for treatment planning and medical education, with potential for clinical applications.

Abstract: Due to privacy concerns, obtaining large datasets is challenging in medical
image analysis, especially with 3D modalities like Computed Tomography (CT) and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing generative models, developed to
address this issue, often face limitations in output diversity and thus cannot
accurately represent 3D medical images. We propose a tumor-generation model
that utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features
are high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically
well-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs
a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to
generate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the
user to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features
such as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the
physicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors
according to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal,
manipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in
different scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different
organs (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI. The synthesized
images are shown to effectively aid in training for downstream tasks and their
authenticity was also evaluated through expert evaluations. Our method has
potential usage in treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors.

*Jonghun Kim,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion model with prompt tuning is proposed to predict post-treatment DCE-MRI images from pre-treatment images for breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, incorporating clinical factors to improve response prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of NAC response helps with treatment planning for breast cancer patients, and current monitoring using DCE-MRI could be enhanced by generative models to forecast treatment outcomes.

Method: Uses maximum intensity projection images from DCE-MRI and adopts a diffusion model with prompt tuning to incorporate clinical factors affecting NAC response, generating post-treatment images from pre-treatment data.

Result: The model outperformed other generative models in image quality metrics and better reflected tumor size changes according to pathological complete response (pCR). Ablation studies confirmed the method's design choices.

Conclusion: The proposed approach has potential to contribute to precision medicine by improving NAC response prediction through generative modeling of DCE-MRI images.

Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a common therapy option before the main
surgery for breast cancer. Response to NAC is monitored using follow-up dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Accurate prediction of
NAC response helps with treatment planning. Here, we adopt maximum intensity
projection images from DCE-MRI to generate post-treatment images (i.e., 3 or 12
weeks after NAC) from pre-treatment images leveraging the emerging diffusion
model. We introduce prompt tuning to account for the known clinical factors
affecting response to NAC. Our model performed better than other generative
models in image quality metrics. Our model was better at generating images that
reflected changes in tumor size according to pCR compared to other models.
Ablation study confirmed the design choices of our method. Our study has the
potential to help with precision medicine.

### [217] [Talk in Pieces, See in Whole: Disentangling and Hierarchical Aggregating Representations for Language-based Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24192)
*Sojung An,Kwanyong Park,Yong Jae Lee,Donghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The TaSe framework improves vision-language models' ability to handle complex queries by disentangling text into objects, attributes, and relations, then aggregating them hierarchically, achieving 24% performance improvement on OmniLabel benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses due to text encoders treating text as bags-of-words, failing to separate target objects from their attributes and relations.

Method: Proposed TaSe framework with: (1) hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset, (2) Talk in Pieces module for disentangling text into objects/attributes/relations using novel loss function, (3) See in Whole module for hierarchical aggregation of components.

Result: 24% performance improvement on OmniLabel benchmark, demonstrating significant enhancement in handling complex queries with descriptive attributes and relational clauses.

Conclusion: Linguistic compositionality through hierarchical disentanglement and aggregation is crucial for improving VLMs' perception of complex queries, and the TaSe framework effectively addresses limitations of current text encoders.

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
multimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple
language queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive
complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our
in-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders
in VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate
target objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex
queries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose
restructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical
relations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight
is the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects,
attributes, and relations ("talk in pieces")-and subsequently aggregating them
into hierarchically structured sentence-level representations ("see in whole").
Building on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main
contributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three
tiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the
three-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss
function, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in
Whole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically
structured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The
proposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical
linguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for
language-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel
benchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of
linguistic compositionality.

*Zach Eidex,Mojtaba Safari,Jie Ding,Richard Qiu,Justin Roper,David Yu,Hui-Kuo Shu,Zhen Tian,Hui Mao,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D deep learning framework called T1C-RFlow generates synthetic T1-contrast enhanced MRI images from pre-contrast multiparametric MRI using latent rectified flow diffusion, achieving high-quality results faster than conventional diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) used in T1w MRI have limitations including nephrogenic systemic fibrosis risks and imaging inconsistencies due to administration variations. This study aims to create a contrast-agent-free alternative for brain tumor imaging.

Method: The T1C-RFlow model uses pre-contrast T1w and T2-FLAIR images encoded into a latent space via a pretrained autoencoder, then applies a rectified flow diffusion model trained on BraTS 2024 datasets (2860 training, 612 validation, 614 test patients across glioma, meningioma, and metastases).

Result: T1C-RFlow outperformed benchmark models (pix2pix, DDPM, DiT-3D) with best tumor reconstruction performance and significantly faster denoising (6.9s/volume vs 37.7s for DDPM). Achieved NMSE 0.044-0.098 and SSIM 0.905-0.937 across different tumor types.

Conclusion: The proposed method generates synthetic T1C images closely resembling ground truth in much less time than previous diffusion models, potentially enabling practical contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

Abstract: Objective: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly employed
with T1w MRI to enhance lesion visualization but are restricted in patients at
risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and variations in GBCA administration can
introduce imaging inconsistencies. This study develops an efficient 3D
deep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from
pre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified
flow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and
T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient
latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained
in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a
curated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients),
meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets.
Selected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test
(N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate
that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM,
Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow
achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/-
0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/-
0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082. T1C-RFlow had the best tumor reconstruction
performance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps)
than conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and
patch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume). Significance: Our proposed method
generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much
less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a
practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

TL;DR: UniVid is a unified video model that combines generation and understanding capabilities through an MLLM-diffusion decoder architecture with lightweight adapter, achieving state-of-the-art performance on video benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in unified video modeling: maintaining semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to text-visual token imbalance, and efficiently extending image MLLMs to video without costly retraining.

Method: Couples MLLM with diffusion decoder through lightweight adapter; uses Temperature Modality Alignment for prompt adherence and Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe selection.

Result: Achieves 2.2% improvement on VBench-Long total score vs EasyAnimateV5.1, and 1.0% and 3.3% accuracy gains on MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA vs best prior 7B baselines.

Conclusion: UniVid provides an effective unified architecture for both video understanding and generation with state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Unified video modeling that combines generation and understanding
capabilities is increasingly important but faces two key challenges:
maintaining semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to
text-visual token imbalance and the limitations of uniform cross-modal
attention across the flow trajectory, and efficiently extending image-centric
MLLMs to video without costly retraining. We present UniVid, a unified
architecture that couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through a
lightweight adapter, enabling both video understanding and generation. We
introduce Temperature Modality Alignment to improve prompt adherence and
Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe
selection. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 2.2% improvement on VBench-Long total
score compared to EasyAnimateV5.1, and 1.0% and 3.3% accuracy gains on MSVD-QA
and ActivityNet-QA, respectively, compared with the best prior 7B baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BALR-SAM is a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation framework that enhances SAM for medical image segmentation by combining complementary detail enhancement, low-rank adapters, and efficient tensor attention, achieving SOTA performance while updating only 1.8% of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like SAM struggle with medical image segmentation due to domain mismatch, and fine-tuning them efficiently for clinical practice with minimal resources while maintaining performance is challenging.

Method: Three components: (1) Complementary Detail Enhancement Network with depthwise separable convolutions for boundary features; (2) Low-rank adapters in ViT blocks for medical context optimization; (3) Low-rank tensor attention in mask decoder for 75% memory reduction.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods including fully fine-tuned MedSAM on standard medical datasets without requiring prompts, while updating only 1.8% (11.7M) of parameters.

Conclusion: BALR-SAM provides an efficient and effective solution for adapting foundation models to medical imaging, achieving superior performance with minimal parameter updates and resource demands.

Abstract: Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on
large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image
segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice,
fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal
resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To
address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation
framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored
components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using
depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture
boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank
adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature
representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously
significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention
mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting
inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show
that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8%
(11.7M) of its parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Forge4D is a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction model that efficiently creates temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis through streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic 3D human reconstruction are either too slow or cannot generate novel-time representations, limiting downstream applications.

Method: Uses streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction with learnable state tokens for temporal consistency, and a motion prediction module with self-supervised retargeting loss and occlusion-aware optical flow loss for novel time synthesis.

Result: The model effectively reconstructs 4D humans from sparse-view videos and enables interpolation at arbitrary timestamps, demonstrating strong performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: Forge4D provides an efficient solution for instant 4D human reconstruction and interpolation from uncalibrated sparse-view videos, addressing limitations of previous methods in speed and novel-time synthesis capabilities.

Abstract: Instant reconstruction of dynamic 3D humans from uncalibrated sparse-view
videos is critical for numerous downstream applications. Existing methods,
however, are either limited by the slow reconstruction speeds or incapable of
generating novel-time representations. To address these challenges, we propose
Forge4D, a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction and interpolation model that
efficiently reconstructs temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated
sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis. Our
model simplifies the 4D reconstruction and interpolation problem as a joint
task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction. For
the task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction, we first reconstruct static
3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images and then introduce learnable
state tokens to enforce temporal consistency in a memory-friendly manner by
interactively updating shared information across different timestamps. For
novel time synthesis, we design a novel motion prediction module to predict
dense motions for each 3D Gaussian between two adjacent frames, coupled with an
occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion process to interpolate 3D Gaussians at
arbitrary timestamps. To overcome the lack of the ground truth for dense motion
supervision, we formulate dense motion prediction as a dense point matching
task and introduce a self-supervised retargeting loss to optimize this module.
An additional occlusion-aware optical flow loss is introduced to ensure motion
consistency with plausible human movement, providing stronger regularization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Project page and code at:

TL;DR: AVF-MAE++ is a family of audio-visual masked autoencoder models that addresses data limitations in affective video facial analysis through scalable pre-training and improved cross-modal correlation modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Affective video facial analysis suffers from limited data availability and lacks exploration of scaling properties. Existing methods struggle with capturing both intra- and inter-modal correlations through scalable audio-visual representations.

Method: Proposes AVF-MAE++ with dual masking strategy across audio/visual modalities, strengthened modality encoders, Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, and progressive semantic injection strategy with three training stages.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 17 datasets covering three major AVFA tasks, with comprehensive ablation studies validating each component's importance.

Conclusion: The framework successfully demonstrates scalable pre-training for AVFA, provides insights into design choices, and offers publicly released code and models for community use.

Abstract: Affective video facial analysis (AVFA) has emerged as a key research field
for building emotion-aware intelligent systems, yet this field continues to
suffer from limited data availability. In recent years, the self-supervised
learning (SSL) technique of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) has gained momentum, with
growing adaptations in its audio-visual contexts. While scaling has proven
essential for breakthroughs in general multi-modal learning domains, its
specific impact on AVFA remains largely unexplored. Another core challenge in
this field is capturing both intra- and inter-modal correlations through
scalable audio-visual representations. To tackle these issues, we propose
AVF-MAE++, a family of audio-visual MAE models designed to efficiently
investigate the scaling properties in AVFA while enhancing cross-modal
correlation modeling. Our framework introduces a novel dual masking strategy
across audio and visual modalities and strengthens modality encoders with a
more holistic design to better support scalable pre-training. Additionally, we
present the Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, which improves
correlation learning within the SSL paradigm, bridging the limitations of
previous methods. To support smooth adaptation and reduce overfitting risks, we
further introduce a progressive semantic injection strategy, organizing the
model training into three structured stages. Extensive experiments conducted on
17 datasets, covering three major AVFA tasks, demonstrate that AVF-MAE++
achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the importance of each
proposed component and provide deeper insights into the design choices driving
these improvements. Our code and models have been publicly released at Github.

TL;DR: The paper introduces two training-free inference-time techniques for robot video generation that actively incorporate explicit action parameters to guide diffusion models, improving action coherence and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build effective world models and robotics foundation models by generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories, moving beyond treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals.

Method: Two training-free inference-time techniques: 1) Action-scaled classifier-free guidance that dynamically modulates guidance strength based on action magnitude, and 2) Action-scaled noise truncation that adjusts initial noise distribution to align with motion dynamics.

Result: Experiments on real robot manipulation datasets show significant improvements in action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation without requiring additional training, enhancing controllability over motion intensity and improving overall video quality.

Abstract: Generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories is a
critical step toward building effective world models and robotics foundation
models. We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully
exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation.
Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods
actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process
and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled
classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion
to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second,
action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled
noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real
robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly
improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

TL;DR: Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR) enables autoregressive reasoning directly in visual embedding space, improving perception-intensive VQA tasks by interleaving visual token reconstruction with text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs with CoT reasoning are constrained to language space, treating visual information as static preconditions, limiting their visual reasoning capabilities.

Method: Visual encoder projects images into visual tokens in joint semantic space; language model generates latent states to reconstruct key visual tokens; interleaves LVR with text generation; adapts GRPO algorithm for reinforcement learning on latent reasoning.

Result: Achieves 71.67% on MMVP benchmark compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL, showing substantial gains in fine-grained visual understanding and perception.

Conclusion: LVR paradigm enables direct visual reasoning in embedding space, significantly enhancing multimodal models' perception capabilities for visual question answering tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in
various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language
spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for
visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning
trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained:
reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information
treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a
new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual
embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens
within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language
model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual
tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent
visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model
achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering
tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement
learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We
show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and
perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code
base and model weights will be released later.

TL;DR: Proposes CoTAM, an image codec tailored for Multimodal Large Language Models that achieves up to 35.99% bitrate savings while maintaining MLLM task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional image codecs optimized for human visual perception are ill-suited for MLLMs, which have different feature requirements across diverse downstream tasks.

Method: Uses CLIP's shallow-layer attention to generate importance maps for adaptive bit allocation, and integrates a lightweight decoder adapter with multi-level loss function for feature reconstruction.

Result: Achieves up to 35.99% bitrate saving while maintaining same performance on MLLM tasks, outperforming previous state-of-the-art neural codecs.

Conclusion: The proposed CoTAM codec effectively addresses MLLM-specific compression needs by adaptively protecting multi-level features according to downstream task requirements.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), typically hosted on cloud platforms, urgently requires effective
compression techniques to efficiently transmit signal inputs (e.g., images,
videos) from edge devices with minimal bandwidth usage. However, conventional
image codecs are optimized for fidelity to serve the Human Visual System (HVS)
and ill-suited for MLLMs, in which diverse downstream tasks are jointly
considered. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of
compression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression
distortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying
effects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance.
Motivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs
(CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different
demands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer
attention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical
semantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter
with a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of
low-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of
cross-level features. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves
up to 35.99\% bitrate saving while maintaining the same performance on the MLLM
tasks, outperforming previous SOTA neural codecs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spiking Neural Networks offer energy efficiency but face scaling challenges for resource-limited deployment. Current binary SNNs still have substantial storage and computational demands for large networks.

Method: 1) Establish S²NN baseline using kernel clustering patterns from binary SNNs; 2) OS-Quant method to mitigate outlier-induced codeword selection bias; 3) Membrane Potential-based Feature Distillation (MPFD) for improved performance.

Result: S²NN outperforms existing quantized SNNs in both performance and efficiency across vision and non-vision tasks.

Conclusion: S²NNs are promising for edge computing applications due to their superior efficiency and performance compared to existing quantized SNNs.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient paradigm for machine
intelligence, but their continued scaling poses challenges for resource-limited
deployment. Despite recent advances in binary SNNs, the storage and
computational demands remain substantial for large-scale networks. To further
explore the compression and acceleration potential of SNNs, we propose Sub-bit
Spiking Neural Networks (S$^2$NNs) that represent weights with less than one
bit. Specifically, we first establish an S$^2$NN baseline by leveraging the
clustering patterns of kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. This baseline is
highly efficient but suffers from \textit{outlier-induced codeword selection
bias} during training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an
\textit{outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization} (OS-Quant) method, which
optimizes codeword selection by identifying and adaptively scaling outliers.
Furthermore, we propose a \textit{membrane potential-based feature
distillation} (MPFD) method, improving the performance of highly compressed
S$^2$NN via more precise guidance from a teacher model. Extensive results on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring conditioning faithfulness and high-quality synthetic images for direct or counterfactual generation in medical imaging remains challenging with current deep generative models.

Method: A cycle training framework that enforces consistency between generated and original images through cycle constraints to improve conditioning adherence and image realism.

Result: Experiments on 3D brain MRI datasets show improved conditioning accuracy and enhanced image quality as measured by FID and SSIM metrics.

Conclusion: The cycle strategy in CDM is effective for refining diffusion-based medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation, counterfactual analysis, and disease progression modeling.

Abstract: Deep generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in medical image
synthesis. However, ensuring conditioning faithfulness and high-quality
synthetic images for direct or counterfactual generation remains a challenge.
In this work, we introduce a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion
models for improved conditioning adherence and enhanced synthetic image
realism. Our approach, Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM), enforces consistency
between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints,
enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation. Experiments on a
combined 3D brain MRI dataset (from ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, and
PPMI) show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image
quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle
strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based
medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation,
counterfactual, and disease progression modeling.

### [229] [Skeleton-based Robust Registration Framework for Corrupted 3D Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24273)
*Yongqiang Wang,Weigang Li,Wenping Liu,Zhiqiang Tian,Jinling Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A skeleton-based robust registration framework (SRRF) that uses corruption-resilient skeletal representations to improve point cloud registration accuracy and robustness against density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world point clouds suffer from sensor limitations, environmental noise, and preprocessing errors that cause density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations, making traditional registration methods unreliable.

Method: Integrates skeletal structures into registration process, combines transformations from both corrupted point cloud alignment and skeleton alignment, and uses a distribution distance loss function to enforce consistency between source and target skeletons.

Result: SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration methods across various corruption scenarios including density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.

Conclusion: The framework provides robust and accurate registration results by considering both local geometric features and global skeleton structure stability, making it suitable for real-world 3D perception tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including
autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of
multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction.
However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations,
environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging
due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.
Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature
extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to
reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based
robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a
corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness
and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the
registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the
corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal
registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to
enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which
significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures
that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the
global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate
registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets
demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration
methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions,
noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the
robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential
approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

### [230] [Beyond Isolated Facts: Synthesizing Narrative and Grounded Supervision for VideoQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24445)
*Jianxin Liang,Tan Yue,Yuxuan Wang,Yueqian Wang,Zhihan Yin,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to enhance VideoQA by synthesizing richer supervisory signals through Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP) and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), moving beyond isolated factual QA pairs to capture narrative structure and visual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA models are limited by 'bag-of-facts' supervision that fails to capture narrative and causal structure of events, leading to shallow understanding of video content.

Method: Two strategies: QBP synthesizes diverse questions into holistic narrative paragraphs reconstructing event structure; QBC generates fine-grained visual rationales grounding answers in specific evidence. Uses generative models to create synthetic data for unified next-token prediction training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results: 72.5% on STAR (+4.9% improvement) and 80.8% on NExT-QA. Both QBP and QBC enhance cross-dataset generalization, with QBP accelerating model convergence by over 2.5x.

Conclusion: Shifting from isolated facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields more accurate, efficient, and generalizable VideoQA training paradigm.

Abstract: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally
constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of
isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to
capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting
models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this
paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We
propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which
synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set
of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs
the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which
generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question
in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use
this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token
prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our
approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new
state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR
(+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis
reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset
generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over
2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated
facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate,
efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

### [231] [Robust Partial 3D Point Cloud Registration via Confidence Estimation under Global Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24275)
*Yongqiang Wang,Weigang Li,Wenping Liu,Zhe Xu,Zhiqiang Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CEGC is a confidence-driven framework for partial 3D point cloud registration that jointly models overlap confidence and correspondence reliability using global context to handle structural ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial point cloud registration faces challenges from structural ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise, which existing methods struggle to address effectively.

Method: Uses hybrid overlap confidence estimation (semantic descriptors + geometric similarity) and context-aware matching with global attention to assign soft confidence scores, guiding a differentiable weighted SVD solver.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes datasets in accuracy, robustness, and generalization.

Conclusion: CEGC provides an interpretable and scalable solution for partial point cloud registration under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Partial point cloud registration is essential for autonomous perception and
3D scene understanding, yet it remains challenging owing to structural
ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise. We address these issues by proposing
Confidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC), a unified, confidence-driven
framework for robust partial 3D registration. CEGC enables accurate alignment
in complex scenes by jointly modeling overlap confidence and correspondence
reliability within a shared global context. Specifically, the hybrid overlap
confidence estimation module integrates semantic descriptors and geometric
similarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers early. The
context-aware matching strategy smitigates ambiguity by employing global
attention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, improving
robustness. These scores guide a differentiable weighted singular value
decomposition solver to compute precise transformations. This tightly coupled
pipeline adaptively down-weights uncertain regions and emphasizes contextually
reliable matches. Experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes 3D
vision datasets demonstrate that CEGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Overall, CEGC offers an interpretable
and scalable solution to partial point cloud registration under challenging
conditions.

*Shijie Lian,Changti Wu,Laurence Tianruo Yang,Hang Yuan,Bin Yu,Lei Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a surrogate task to improve spatial intelligence in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), achieving state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks through geometry-centric fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial intelligence remains a critical unresolved challenge for MLLMs, despite encompassing important abilities like shape visualization, mental rotation, position judgment, and numerosity estimation.

Method: Created Euclid30K dataset with 30K geometry problems, used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to finetune Qwen2.5VL and RoboBrain2.0 models, enabling shape identification, counting, relation analysis, and multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles.

Result: Models achieved substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks, with mean VSI-Bench accuracy rising from 34.5% to 40.5%. RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieved 49.6% accuracy, surpassing previous state-of-the-art Spatial-MLLM.

Conclusion: This is the first systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills, demonstrating the effectiveness of Euclidean geometry as a surrogate training task.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising
and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational
positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains
a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To
fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a
surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal
dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid
geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean
principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family,
inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and
perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our
experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot
gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench,
VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after
training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models
rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them,
RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first
systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer
vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and

*Sai Raj Kishore Perla,Aditya Vora,Sauradip Nag,Ali Mahdavi-Amiri,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASIA enables 3D segmentation of parts using few image annotations, leveraging diffusion models to transfer segmentations from images to 3D even when objects differ significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D segmentation methods require multi-view images (hard to collect), 3D model annotations (demanding), or text descriptions (ambiguous). ASIA uses easier-to-collect in-the-wild image annotations.

Method: Optimizes text tokens for each segment, fine-tunes with cross-view part correspondence loss, segments multi-view renderings, fuses labels in UV-space via voting, refines with Noise Optimization, and maps back to mesh.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations for both semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: ASIA provides practical and generalizable solution for 3D segmentation using few image annotations, making 3D part segmentation more accessible and precise.

Abstract: We introduce ASIA (Adaptive 3D Segmentation using few Image Annotations), a
novel framework that enables segmentation of possibly non-semantic and
non-text-describable "parts" in 3D. Our segmentation is controllable through a
few user-annotated in-the-wild images, which are easier to collect than
multi-view images, less demanding to annotate than 3D models, and more precise
than potentially ambiguous text descriptions. Our method leverages the rich
priors of text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to
transfer segmentations from image space to 3D, even when the annotated and
target objects differ significantly in geometry or structure. During training,
we optimize a text token for each segment and fine-tune our model with a novel
cross-view part correspondence loss. At inference, we segment multi-view
renderings of the 3D mesh, fuse the labels in UV-space via voting, refine them
with our novel Noise Optimization technique, and finally map the UV-labels back
onto the mesh. ASIA provides a practical and generalizable solution for both
semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods
by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVGThinker is a reasoning-driven framework for text-to-SVG generation that improves generalization and instruction adherence by aligning SVG code production with the visualization process using chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address weak generalization and poor adherence to input instructions in text-to-SVG generation, leveraging recent advances in large language models.

Method: A pipeline that renders SVG primitives sequentially, uses multimodal models to annotate images and code, builds stepwise updates mirroring incremental primitive addition, and trains LLMs with supervised fine-tuning using chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and higher-quality SVGs compared to state-of-the-art baselines while preserving vector graphics structural advantages.

Conclusion: The framework enables precise and hierarchical editing, opening new directions for design, content creation, and automated graphics generation, unlike image-based methods.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a code-based representation for 2D visuals.
Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we study
text-to-SVG generation and address two persistent gaps: weak generalization and
poor adherence to input instructions. We present SVGThinker, a reasoning-driven
framework that aligns the production of SVG code with the visualization process
and supports the full set of SVG primitives. Our pipeline first renders each
primitive in sequence and uses a multimodal model to annotate the image and
code; we then build stepwise updates that mirror the incremental addition of
primitives. On this data, we train an LLM with supervised fine-tuning that
exposes its chain-of-thought as intermediate reasoning, improving robustness
and reducing errors and hallucinations. Experiments against state-of-the-art
baselines show that SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and
higher-quality SVGs while preserving the structural advantages of vector
graphics. Unlike image-based methods, our outputs enable precise and
hierarchical editing, opening new directions for design, content creation, and
automated graphics generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrameThinker is a novel framework that enables Large Vision-Language Models to iteratively interrogate long videos through adaptive frame selection and strategic reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs struggle with long video reasoning due to uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient and inadequate for visually intensive video tasks.

Method: Proposes a two-phase training strategy: 1) Supervised Fine-Tuning to instill fundamental action capabilities, and 2) Reinforcement Learning with comprehensive reward design to optimize strategic decision-making policy for iterative video interrogation.

Result: Achieves significant average improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing processed frames. The 7B model establishes new SOTA on LongVideo-Reason with 76.1% accuracy using only 20.6 frames on average, outperforming LongVILA-R1 (72.0%) with over 20x fewer frames.

Conclusion: FrameThinker demonstrates unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness in long video reasoning, enabling LVLMs to think strategically about video content through adaptive frame selection and iterative reasoning.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress
in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered
by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient
and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long
videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs
are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video
reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in
adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing
reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve
these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities,
followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making
policy.Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive
exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive
experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and
long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and
LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average
improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of
processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new
state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average
of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1
(72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating
unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural rendering methods suffer from inaccurate geometry in texture-less indoor regions and decouple mesh extraction from optimization, missing opportunities to use mesh geometry to guide splat optimization.

Method: Joint optimization of explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian splats using flexible binding strategy, integrating mesh constraints and monocular normal supervision, with iterative mesh refinement through face splitting and pruning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on indoor reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-L1 by 47.3% over 2DGS baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality.

Conclusion: OMeGa effectively addresses prior limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction through joint mesh-splat optimization and iterative refinement strategies.

Abstract: Neural rendering with Gaussian splatting has advanced novel view synthesis,
and most methods reconstruct surfaces via post-hoc mesh extraction. However,
existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) inaccurate geometry in
texture-less indoor regions, and (ii) the decoupling of mesh extraction from
optimization, thereby missing the opportunity to leverage mesh geometry to
guide splat optimization. In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end
framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian
splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian
Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on
splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh
constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby
regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative
mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable
ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh.
OMeGa achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor
reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3\% over the 2DGS
baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality. The
experimental results demonstrate that OMeGa effectively addresses prior
limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed foundation model advances scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET by addressing key challenges through synthetic data generation, adaptive architecture design, and noise-resilient learning strategies.

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables in situ visualization of
macromolecular structures, where subtomogram analysis tasks such as
classification, alignment, and averaging are critical for structural

first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we
introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over
904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design
an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which
incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module
that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we
introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize
representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional MRI quality assessment methods - signal-based approaches lack semantic understanding while deep learning methods sacrifice interpretability.

Method: Three innovations: robust metric extraction with simulated artifacts, transforming metrics into QA pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion via LoRA of LLaVA-OneVision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MR-ART, FastMRI, and MyConnectome benchmarks with strong zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: Bridges quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning to generate clinically interpretable outputs for enhanced quality control in medical settings.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical
decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol
variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based
methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic
understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but
sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal
processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via
MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics
into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI,
and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with
strong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation
studies. By bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, our
framework generates clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality
control in dynamic medical settings.

in crowded scenes due to occlusions and limited camera views. To address this,
we propose a tri-plane-based multi-view chicken counting model (TP-MVCC), which
leverages geometric projection and tri-plane fusion to integrate features from
multiple cameras onto a unified ground plane. The framework extracts
single-view features, aligns them via spatial transformation, and decodes a
scene-level density map for precise chicken counting. In addition, we construct
the first multi-view dataset of silkie chickens under real farming conditions.
Experiments show that TP-MVCC significantly outperforms single-view and
conventional fusion comparisons, achieving 95.1\% accuracy and strong
robustness in dense, occluded scenarios, demonstrating its practical potential
for intelligent agriculture.

### [242] [Hyperspherical Latents Improve Continuous-Token Autoregressive Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24335)
*Guolin Ke,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SphereAR addresses variance collapse in autoregressive image generation by constraining VAE latents to a fixed-radius hypersphere, achieving state-of-the-art FID scores that surpass diffusion and masked-generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for image generation suffer from heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is amplified during decoding and causes variance collapse, especially under classifier-free guidance.

Method: Proposes SphereAR which constrains all AR inputs and outputs to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere using hyperspherical VAEs, removing the scale component that causes variance collapse.

Result: SphereAR-H (943M) achieves FID 1.34 on ImageNet generation, setting new SOTA for AR models. Smaller variants SphereAR-L (479M) and SphereAR-B (208M) reach FID 1.54 and 1.92 respectively, outperforming larger baselines.

Conclusion: SphereAR is the first pure next-token AR image generator with raster order that surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter scales, proving the effectiveness of hyperspherical constraints for stabilizing AR decoding.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet
continuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation
models. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is
amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG),
and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its
core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG --
to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\ell_2$ norm), leveraging
hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical
constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance
collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet
generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models,
achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54
and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger
baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92). To our knowledge,
this is the first time a pure next-token AR image generator with raster order
surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter
scales.

*Yan Ke,Xin Yu,Heming Du,Scott Chapman,Helen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework for agricultural visual question answering that integrates four roles (Retriever, Reflector, Answerer, Improver) to handle multi-image inputs and incomplete evidence through context enrichment and iterative improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agricultural VQA approaches are limited to text-only queries or single-image cases, failing to handle real-world scenarios requiring multi-image inputs across spatial scales and growth stages, and struggling with incomplete evidence due to limited external context access.

Method: A self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework with four roles: Retriever (gathers external information), Reflector (assesses adequacy and triggers reformulation), Answerer (drafts candidate responses in parallel), and Improver (refines answers through iterative checks while aligning multi-image information).

Result: Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show competitive performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-agent framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches by enabling context enrichment, reflective reasoning, and iterative improvement for handling complex multi-image agricultural scenarios.

Abstract: Agricultural visual question answering is essential for providing farmers and
researchers with accurate and timely knowledge. However, many existing
approaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such
as text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from
coping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image
inputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages.
Moreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes
these systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid
pipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we
propose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that
integrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the
Improver. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning,
answer drafting, and iterative improvement.
  A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a
Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed
retrieval. Two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias.
The Improver refines them through iterative checks while ensuring that
information from multiple images is effectively aligned and utilized.
Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show that our framework achieves competitive
performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

### [244] [NeRV-Diffusion: Diffuse Implicit Neural Representations for Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24353)
*Yixuan Ren,Hanyu Wang,Hao Chen,Bo He,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeRV-Diffusion is an implicit latent video diffusion model that generates videos by synthesizing neural network weights, which form an implicit neural representation (INR) to decode videos from frame indices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient and high-quality video synthesis by generating videos holistically as unified neural networks rather than frame-wise feature maps, avoiding temporal cross-frame attentions and allowing dedicated decoding.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Hypernetwork-based tokenizer encodes videos to neural parameter space, 2) Implicit diffusion transformer denoises latent INR weights. Uses weight reuse, reformulated connections, SNR-adaptive loss weighting, and scheduled sampling.

Result: Achieves superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and comparable performance to state-of-the-art non-implicit models on UCF-101 and Kinetics-600 benchmarks. Enables smooth interpolations between frames/videos.

Conclusion: NeRV-Diffusion demonstrates that generating videos as implicit neural representations through weight synthesis is an effective approach for high-quality video generation with efficient decoding and interpolation capabilities.

Abstract: We present NeRV-Diffusion, an implicit latent video diffusion model that
synthesizes videos via generating neural network weights. The generated weights
can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which
forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with
frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A
hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural
parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode.
2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights.
In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise
feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a
unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis
via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding
video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR
weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all
NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and
input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled
sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion
reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and
comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on
real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings
a smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between
frames or videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LamFormer is a U-shaped network for multi-organ medical image segmentation that uses Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) to capture long-range dependencies with lower computational cost, Parallel Hierarchical Feature Aggregation (PHFA) to aggregate multi-scale features, and Reduced Transformer (RT) to enhance local detail extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational cost of Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information in multi-organ medical image segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposed LamFormer with three key components: 1) Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in pyramid encoder for multi-scale long-range dependencies, 2) Parallel Hierarchical Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate and filter multi-layer features, 3) Reduced Transformer (RT) for global modeling of up-sampled features to enhance local detail extraction.

Result: Outperforms existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets, demonstrating exceptional performance while achieving a balance between model performance and complexity.

Conclusion: LamFormer effectively addresses computational efficiency and local detail extraction challenges in multi-organ medical image segmentation, providing superior performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: In the field of multi-organ medical image segmentation, recent methods
frequently employ Transformers to capture long-range dependencies from image
features. However, these methods overlook the high computational cost of
Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information.
To address high computational costs and inadequate local detail information, we
reassess the design of feature extraction modules and propose a new
deep-learning network called LamFormer for fine-grained segmentation tasks
across multiple organs. LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network that employs
Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder to capture
multi-scale long-range dependencies. We construct the Parallel Hierarchical
Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different layers
of the encoder, narrowing the semantic gap among features while filtering
information. Finally, we design the Reduced Transformer (RT), which utilizes a
distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features. RRT
enhances the extraction of detailed local information and improves the
network's capability to capture long-range dependencies. LamFormer outperforms
existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets,
demonstrating exceptional performance. Moreover, the proposed network achieves
a balance between model performance and model complexity.

### [246] [TemMed-Bench: Evaluating Temporal Medical Image Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25143)
*Junyi Zhang,Jia-Chen Gu,Wenbo Hu,Yu Zhou,Robinson Piramuthu,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TemMed-Bench is the first benchmark for analyzing patient condition changes across clinical visits using temporal medical images, revealing that most LVLMs struggle with temporal reasoning and benefit from multi-modal retrieval augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks focus on single-visit analysis, which doesn't reflect real clinical practice where doctors track patient changes over time through multiple visits.

Method: Created TemMed-Bench with three tasks (VQA, report generation, image-pair selection) and a 17,000+ instance knowledge corpus. Evaluated 12 LVLMs and explored multi-modal retrieval augmentation combining visual and textual modalities.

Result: Most LVLMs lack temporal medical image reasoning ability, with many performing at random-guessing level. GPT o3, o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet performed best but still below desired level. Multi-modal retrieval improved VQA performance by 2.59% on average.

Conclusion: LVLMs have significant limitations in temporal medical image reasoning. Multi-modal retrieval augmentation shows promise as a direction to address this challenge in clinical practice.

Abstract: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily
focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit.
However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice,
where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a
comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we
introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in
patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large
vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images.
TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual
question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a
supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we
conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results
show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes
over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a
random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini
and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they
have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the
input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain.
We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher
performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most
models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of
2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical
practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image
reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval
augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address
this challenge.

### [247] [DRIFT: Divergent Response in Filtered Transformations for Robust Adversarial Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24359)
*Amira Guesmi,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRIFT is a stochastic ensemble defense that disrupts gradient consensus to prevent adversarial transferability by enforcing gradient dissonance across transformations while maintaining natural accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and most defenses fail when gradients can be reliably estimated. The key vulnerability is gradient consensus - where randomized transformations yield aligned gradients that attackers exploit for transferable adversarial attacks.

Method: DRIFT uses a stochastic ensemble of lightweight, learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. It enforces gradient dissonance by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions through consensus-divergence training combining prediction consistency, Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness.

Result: DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks.

Conclusion: DRIFT establishes gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial defense, delivering robustness improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost.

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, and
most defenses collapse once gradients can be reliably estimated. We identify
\emph{gradient consensus} -- the tendency of randomized transformations to
yield aligned gradients -- as a key driver of adversarial transferability.
Attackers exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain
effective across transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent
Response in Filtered Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight,
learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior
randomized defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces
\emph{gradient dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and
logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions
are threefold: (i) we formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical
analysis linking consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a
consensus-divergence training strategy combining prediction consistency,
Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness; and
(iii) we show that DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet
across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art
preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under
adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks. DRIFT delivers
these improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost, establishing
gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial
defense.

TL;DR: GSM8K-V is a new visual mathematical reasoning benchmark created by converting text-based GSM8K problems into visual form, revealing significant performance gaps between text and visual reasoning in current vision language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks are limited to geometry, lack math word problems, and rarely assess multi-image reasoning. There's a need for a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate VLMs' visual mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Method: Systematically mapped GSM8K text samples into visual form using an automated image-generation pipeline combined with human annotation, creating 1,319 high-quality visual math problems.

Result: Current VLMs show substantial performance gap: Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves 95.22% on text GSM8K but only 46.93% on GSM8K-V, indicating visual reasoning remains challenging despite text saturation.

Conclusion: GSM8K-V provides a new benchmark for visual mathematical reasoning, highlighting current model limitations and guiding development of more robust and generalizable vision language models.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text,
enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception,
planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly
representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It
highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical
information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently,
numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they
are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and
rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we
introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning
benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the
widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed
automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,
we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source
and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs
have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains
substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on
GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the
limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement.
GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and
establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and
generalizable VLMs.

Motivation: Current MLLMs face challenges in domain-specific UI tasks, particularly in understanding accuracy and generation quality for complex modern UIs.

Method: Combines SFT with GRPO for understanding tasks, DPO for generation tasks, and introduces an industrial workflow including LLM-friendly DSL, training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation metrics.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on UI understanding tasks, outperforming larger general-purpose MLLMs and similarly-sized UI-specialized models. UI generation performance is on par with larger MLLMs at a fraction of computational cost.

Conclusion: Integrating understanding and generation tasks improves accuracy and quality for both tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the unified approach.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied
across domains, they are still facing challenges in domain-specific tasks, such
as User Interface (UI) understanding accuracy and UI generation quality. In
this paper, we introduce UI-UG (a unified MLLM for UI Understanding and
Generation), integrating both capabilities. For understanding tasks, we employ
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to enhance fine-grained understanding on the modern complex UI data. For
generation tasks, we further use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make
our model generate human-preferred UIs. In addition, we propose an industrially
effective workflow, including the design of an LLM-friendly domain-specific
language (DSL), training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation
metrics. In experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
on understanding tasks, outperforming both larger general-purpose MLLMs and
similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Our model is also on par with these
larger MLLMs in UI generation performance at a fraction of the computational

can improve accuracy and quality for both tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-X proposes an X-shaped architecture for unified multimodal models that separates modality-specific processing in initial/final layers while sharing middle layers, eliminating gradient conflicts between vision and text modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard autoregressive transformers for multimodal models suffer from severe gradient conflicts between vision and text modalities due to their fundamentally different low-level statistical properties, particularly in shallow and deep layers.

Method: Uni-X uses a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture with dedicated initial and final layers for modality-specific processing, while maintaining shared parameters in middle layers for high-level semantic fusion.

Result: Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency and, when scaled to 3B parameters, matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs with GenEval score of 82 for image generation and strong performance in text/vision understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Uni-X establishes a parameter-efficient and scalable foundation for unified multimodal modeling by effectively eliminating gradient conflicts through its X-shaped architecture design.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR)
transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we
identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs,
modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between
vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue
to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and
text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where
representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this
challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture.
Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing,
while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level
semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at
both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical
training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to
strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X
matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for
image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding
tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable
foundation for future unified multimodal modeling. Our code is available at

*Jinhee Park,Guisik Kim,Choongsang Cho,Junseok Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R²M is a training-free model merging framework for deepfake detection that combines specialized detectors by decomposing them into shared Real components and Fake residuals, enabling effective detection without retraining when new forgery types appear.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake generators evolve rapidly, making exhaustive data collection and repeated retraining impractical. Model merging is a natural fit for deepfake detection since specialists share the same binary decision task and differ only in generator-specific artifacts.

Method: Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R²M) estimates a shared Real component via low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes specialists into Real-aligned parts and Fake residuals, denoises residuals with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching to prevent any single generator from dominating.

Result: R²M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset scenarios. It also enables composability - when new forgery families appear, only one specialist needs fine-tuning and re-merging, eliminating full retraining.

Conclusion: Model merging is effective for deepfake detection, with R²M providing a training-free framework that preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues, offering both strong performance and practical composability for evolving deepfake threats.

Abstract: Deepfake generators evolve quickly, making exhaustive data collection and
repeated retraining impractical. We argue that model merging is a natural fit
for deepfake detection: unlike generic multi-task settings with disjoint
labels, deepfake specialists share the same binary decision and differ in
generator-specific artifacts. Empirically, we show that simple weight averaging
preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues. Building
upon these findings, we propose Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), a
training-free parameter-space merging framework. R$^2$M estimates a shared Real
component via a low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each
specialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals
with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching
to prevent any single generator from dominating. A concise rationale explains
why a simple head suffices: the Real component induces a common separation
direction in feature space, while truncated residuals contribute only minor
off-axis variations. Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset,
R$^2$M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines. Importantly,
R$^2$M is also composable: when a new forgery family appears, we fine-tune one
specialist and re-merge, eliminating the need for retraining.

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining diffusion models and conditional GANs to generate geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery, achieving improved geometric consistency and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Street view imagery is valuable for urban analytics, but synthesizing it from satellite imagery is challenging due to appearance and perspective differences between the two domains.

Method: Multi-stage training strategy using Stable Diffusion as core component in dual-branch architecture, integrated with conditional GAN for panoramic street views, plus fusion strategy to leverage both models' strengths.

Result: Outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple metrics and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art GAN-based methods on CVUSA dataset, generating realistic street views with preserved local details.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework successfully generates geometrically consistent and visually realistic street-view images while maintaining fine-grained details like street markings and atmospheric elements.

Abstract: Street view imagery has become an essential source for geospatial data
collection and urban analytics, enabling the extraction of valuable insights
that support informed decision-making. However, synthesizing street-view images
from corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to
substantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two
domains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based
models and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate
geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our
approach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable
Diffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance
the framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent
panoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that
leverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations,
thereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated
street-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging
Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach
outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based
methods. The framework successfully generates realistic and geometrically
consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details,
including street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements such as
clouds.

TL;DR: DINOReg is a point cloud registration network that effectively fuses visual features from DINOv2 with geometric features at patch level, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RGB-D datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud registration methods rely mainly on geometric information and don't fully exploit rich texture and semantic information from RGB images. Current multi-modal approaches have image-lossy feature fusion that limits performance.

Method: Uses DINOv2 to extract visual features from images and fuses them with geometric features at patch level. Proposes mixed positional embedding to encode both image and point cloud spatial information.

Result: Achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods: 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and 15.7% increase in registration recall on RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DINOReg effectively combines visual and geometric information through patch-level fusion and mixed positional embedding, demonstrating superior performance in point cloud registration tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most
existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction
and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information
from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve
remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and
semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an
image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose
DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and
geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired
by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract
informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features
at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and
global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric
structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed
positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both
image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to
perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the
RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal
registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7%
increase in registration recall. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: MCAE enables efficient large-scale land cover annotation for submeter imagery by clustering semantically consistent mask groups, achieving 1-2 orders of magnitude efficiency improvement while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Submeter resolution imagery offers fine-grained detail but lacks sufficient high-quality annotated datasets due to unreliable existing labels and prohibitive manual annotation costs for massive data volumes.

Method: Proposed Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE) that treats semantically consistent mask groups as minimal annotating units, leveraging spatial autocorrelation principle where similar objects co-occur in local neighborhoods.

Result: Built HiCity-LC dataset with ~14 billion labeled pixels, enabling city-scale land cover maps across 5 major Chinese cities with >85% classification accuracy - the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level land cover benchmark.

Conclusion: MCAE demonstrates scalability and practical utility for large-scale submeter resolution mapping, significantly advancing land cover analysis capabilities through efficient annotation methodology.

Abstract: Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made submeter resolution
imagery increasingly accessible, offering remarkable detail for fine-grained
land cover analysis. However, its full potential remains underutilized -
particularly for large-scale land cover mapping - due to the lack of
sufficient, high-quality annotated datasets. Existing labels are typically
derived from pre-existing products or manual annotation, which are often
unreliable or prohibitively expensive, particularly given the rich visual
detail and massive data volumes of submeter imagery. Inspired by the spatial
autocorrelation principle, which suggests that objects of the same class tend
to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods, we propose the
Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which treats semantically
consistent mask groups as the minimal annotating units to enable efficient,
simultaneous annotation of multiple instances. It significantly improves
annotation efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude, while preserving label
quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness. With MCAE, we
build a high-quality annotated dataset of about 14 billion labeled pixels,
referred to as HiCity-LC, which supports the generation of city-scale land
cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies
above 85%. It is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level
land cover benchmark, highlighting the scalability and practical utility of
MCAE for large-scale, submeter resolution mapping. The dataset is available at

### [255] [REALIGN: Regularized Procedure Alignment with Matching Video Embeddings via Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24382)
*Soumyadeep Chandra,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REALIGN introduces a self-supervised framework for procedure learning using Regularized Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT) to handle background segments, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders in instructional videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world instructional videos contain background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order, violating the strong monotonicity assumptions of existing alignment methods like OPEL that rely solely on feature similarity without capturing higher-order temporal structure.

Method: REALIGN uses Regularized Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT) to jointly model visual correspondences and temporal relations under partial alignment, integrated with inter-sequence contrastive learning to stabilize training without multiple regularizers.

Result: REALIGN achieves up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains across egocentric (EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step orderings and filter out noise.

Conclusion: The proposed R-FPGWOT framework effectively handles the challenges of procedural video learning by jointly modeling visual and temporal relations, outperforming prior methods and providing more interpretable alignments.

Abstract: Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised
representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains
background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such
variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many
alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage
Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences,
but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order
temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a
self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused
Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT,
our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations
under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant
frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional
videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with
inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple
regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric
(EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves
up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains,
while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step
orderings and filter out noise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vid-LLM is a video-based 3D Multimodal Large Language Model that processes video inputs without requiring external 3D data, using geometric priors and a Cross-Task Adapter to achieve superior performance on 3D scene understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending multimodal reasoning from 2D to 3D domains is challenging, and existing 3D-MLLMs depend on 3D data inputs which limits scalability and real-world deployment.

Method: Proposes Vid-LLM that uses video inputs, incorporates geometric priors via Cross-Task Adapter, employs Metric Depth Model for geometric consistency, and uses two-stage distillation optimization for training.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance on 3D Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning, and 3D Visual Grounding tasks, demonstrating effective multi-task capabilities.

Conclusion: Vid-LLM provides a practical solution for 3D scene understanding without requiring external 3D data, enabling scalable and generalizable 3D multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However,
extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major
challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend
on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this
limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes
video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for
real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to
improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric
cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to
align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To
ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model
that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the
model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy,
realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D
Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks,
demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.

*Junyi Gu,Beatriz Cabrero-Daniel,Ali Nouri,Lydia Armini,Christian Berger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCICF is a framework for systematically identifying and classifying vulnerable road user (VRU) situations to support operational design domain (ODD) incident analysis for robotaxis. It extends the SMIRK dataset to MoreSMIRK with multi-pedestrian crossing scenarios and uses space-filling curves to transform scenario features into patterns for matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotaxis need reliable VRU detection in urban areas, and end-to-end AI systems require high-quality data for training and evaluation within their ODD. Current datasets like SMIRK only cover single-pedestrian scenarios, limiting their usefulness for complex real-world situations.

Method: Extended SMIRK dataset to MoreSMIRK with structured multi-pedestrian crossing situations. Used space-filling curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional scenario features into characteristic patterns for matching with MoreSMIRK dictionary entries.

Result: PCICF successfully identified and classified complex pedestrian crossings in the PIE dataset (150+ annotated videos), even when groups of pedestrians merged or split. The framework showed potential for onboard OOD detection due to computational efficiency.

Conclusion: PCICF provides an effective framework for VRU situation analysis that can handle complex real-world scenarios and has potential for real-time applications in robotaxis. The open-source package enables replication and further development.

Abstract: We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various
countries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on
specific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous
monitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs
typically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road
users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better
handle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute
vehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for
perception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically
training and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose
PCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to
support ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic
dataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design
into the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian
crossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling
curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into
characteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in
MoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which
contains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show
that PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings,
even when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally
efficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of
robotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication
package for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and
dictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in:

Motivation: To bridge the gap between text-to-image generation and 3D asset creation by enabling fast generation of multi-view synthetic images from text prompts.

Method: Proposes a novel spatio-angular latent space that encodes both spatial appearance and angular viewpoint deviations, with a strategically decomposed multi-step training process.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in consistency and latency, with competitive quality and text-image alignment.

Conclusion: RapidMV enables rapid generation of consistent multi-view images, advancing text-to-3D asset creation pipelines.

Abstract: Generating synthetic multi-view images from a text prompt is an essential
bridge to generating synthetic 3D assets. In this work, we introduce RapidMV, a
novel text-to-multi-view generative model that can produce 32 multi-view
synthetic images in just around 5 seconds. In essence, we propose a novel
spatio-angular latent space, encoding both the spatial appearance and angular
viewpoint deviations into a single latent for improved efficiency and
multi-view consistency. We achieve effective training of RapidMV by
strategically decomposing our training process into multiple steps. We
demonstrate that RapidMV outperforms existing methods in terms of consistency
and latency, with competitive quality and text-image alignment.

### [259] [CLQ: Cross-Layer Guided Orthogonal-based Quantization for Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24416)
*Kai Liu,Shaoqiu Zhang,Linghe Kong,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLQ is a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization method for diffusion transformers that achieves W4A4 quantization with negligible performance degradation, providing 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) face practical deployment challenges on edge devices due to large model size and complexity, while existing post-training quantization methods suffer from performance degradation.

Method: Proposes three key designs: cross-block calibration (CBC) for accurate calibration data, orthogonal-based smoothing (OBS) to handle outliers using block Hadamard matrix, and cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS).

Result: Successfully compresses DiTs to W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual quality and metrics, achieving 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup for both image and video generation models.

Conclusion: CLQ provides an effective quantization solution for diffusion transformers that maintains performance while significantly reducing memory and computational requirements, enabling practical deployment on edge devices.

Abstract: Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances
in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model
size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical
deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application.
Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training
quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the
inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the
degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization
method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we
observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not
honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose
cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which
the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based
smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and
leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible
overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search.
We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and
successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual
quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our
code is available at

*Pei-Han Chen,Szu-Chi Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a systematic pipeline for assessing image dataset quality using enhanced tools (CleanVision and Fastdup) with automatic thresholding, showing significant improvements in detecting low-quality images and near-duplicates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As model architectures mature and gains from refinements diminish, data quality has become critical, but systematic studies on evaluating image dataset quality remain limited.

Method: Developed a pipeline integrating CleanVision and Fastdup tools with enhancements including automatic threshold selection. Used CIFAKE dataset to identify quality issues and quantify their impact on model performance.

Result: Automatic thresholding improved F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 (single perturbations) and 0.7447 to 0.8557 (dual perturbations). Near-duplicate detection F1 score increased from 0.4576 to 0.7928. CNNs showed resilience to some distortions but vulnerability to blurring and severe downscaling.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow effectively improves data quality assessment, providing a foundation for advancing image dataset quality evaluation in machine learning.

Abstract: In machine learning, research has traditionally focused on model development,
with relatively less attention paid to training data. As model architectures
have matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality
has emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and
ensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.
  This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset
quality and examines how various image quality factors influence model
performance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset,
we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training.
Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two
community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying
mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold
selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.
  Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same
level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain
distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure
critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess
the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed
enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary
classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our
automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under
single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For
near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score
from 0.4576 to 0.7928. These results underscore the effectiveness of our
workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in
image-based machine learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proxy-GS introduces occlusion awareness to 3D Gaussian Splatting using a fast proxy system that produces occlusion depth maps in under 1ms, enabling both rendering acceleration and improved quality in occluded regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods suffer from significant redundancy due to lack of occlusion awareness, leading to computational inefficiency and rendering artifacts in occluded areas.

Method: Uses a fast proxy system to generate precise occlusion depth maps at 1000x1000 resolution in under 1ms, which guides both anchor/Gaussian culling for rendering acceleration and densification during training for improved quality.

Result: Achieves more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS while delivering substantially higher rendering quality, particularly in heavily occluded scenarios like the MatrixCity Streets dataset.

Conclusion: Proxy-GS effectively addresses occlusion redundancy in 3D Gaussian Splatting, enabling both faster rendering and improved visual fidelity through occlusion-aware optimization.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for
achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve
visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering.
To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail
(LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number
of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals
that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion
awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a
proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of
our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion
depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles:
first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering
speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training,
avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering
quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset,
Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering
capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves
more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially
higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.

TL;DR: DCFlow is an unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation framework that uses decoupled optimization and cross-modal consistency constraints to address modality discrepancy and geometric misalignment without ground-truth flow supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches implicitly learn flow estimation from appearance similarity alone, which doesn't adequately address modality discrepancy and geometric misalignment between different modalities.

Method: Collaboratively trains modality transfer and flow estimation networks using decoupled optimization strategy with task-specific supervision, geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline, outlier-robust loss, and cross-modal consistency constraint.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches and can be integrated with various flow estimation networks.

Conclusion: DCFlow provides an effective unsupervised framework for cross-modal flow estimation that addresses key challenges through decoupled optimization and cross-modal consistency constraints.

Abstract: This work presents DCFlow, a novel unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation
framework that integrates a decoupled optimization strategy and a cross-modal
consistency constraint. Unlike previous approaches that implicitly learn flow
estimation solely from appearance similarity, we introduce a decoupled
optimization strategy with task-specific supervision to address modality
discrepancy and geometric misalignment distinctly. This is achieved by
collaboratively training a modality transfer network and a flow estimation
network. To enable reliable motion supervision without ground-truth flow, we
propose a geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline combined with an
outlier-robust loss. Additionally, we introduce a cross-modal consistency
constraint to jointly optimize both networks, significantly improving flow
prediction accuracy. For evaluation, we construct a comprehensive cross-modal
flow benchmark by repurposing public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
that DCFlow can be integrated with various flow estimation networks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches.

TL;DR: UI2V-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating Image-to-Video (I2V) generation models, focusing on semantic understanding and reasoning abilities rather than just video quality and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing I2V evaluation benchmarks overlook models' ability to understand specific subject semantics in input images and ensure generated videos align with physical laws and human commonsense.

Method: Proposes UI2V-Bench with four evaluation dimensions (spatial understanding, attribute binding, category understanding, reasoning) and two MLLM-based evaluation methods: instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding and feedback-based reasoning pipeline for step-by-step causal assessment.

Result: Evaluated multiple open-source and closed-source I2V models using ~500 text-image pairs, with human evaluations showing strong alignment with MLLM-based metrics.

Conclusion: UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, providing a robust framework and dataset for future research and model development.

Abstract: Generative diffusion models are developing rapidly and attracting increasing
attention due to their wide range of applications. Image-to-Video (I2V)
generation has become a major focus in the field of video synthesis. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on aspects such as video quality
and temporal consistency, while largely overlooking the model's ability to
understand the semantics of specific subjects in the input image or to ensure
that the generated video aligns with physical laws and human commonsense. To
address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V
models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four
primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding,
category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design
two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an
instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a
feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment
for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully
constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and
closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate
human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based
metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by
emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust
framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the
field.

TL;DR: NeoWorld is a framework that generates interactive 3D virtual worlds from single images using hybrid 3D foreground objects and 2D backgrounds, enabling dynamic exploration and natural language control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by on-demand worldbuilding from Simulacron-3, to create efficient virtual worlds where only actively explored regions are rendered with high realism, overcoming limitations of global generation and 2D hallucination methods.

Method: Uses object-centric 3D representations for key foreground objects while synthesizing backgrounds in 2D, combining representation learning and object-to-3D techniques for hybrid scene structure with flexible viewpoint manipulation and natural language control.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing 2D and 2.5D methods on WorldScore benchmark, enabling progressive 3D detail unfolding during user interaction with physically plausible animation.

Conclusion: NeoWorld delivers dynamic, immersive exploration experiences with visual coherence through its hybrid approach, advancing interactive 3D world generation from single images.

Abstract: We introduce NeoWorld, a deep learning framework for generating interactive
3D virtual worlds from a single input image. Inspired by the on-demand
worldbuilding concept in the science fiction novel Simulacron-3 (1964), our
system constructs expansive environments where only the regions actively
explored by the user are rendered with high visual realism through
object-centric 3D representations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on
global world generation or 2D hallucination, NeoWorld models key foreground
objects in full 3D, while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions
in 2D to ensure efficiency. This hybrid scene structure, implemented with
cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enables
flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible scene animation,
allowing users to control object appearance and dynamics using natural language
commands. As users interact with the environment, the virtual world
progressively unfolds with increasing 3D detail, delivering a dynamic,
immersive, and visually coherent exploration experience. NeoWorld significantly
outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore
benchmark.

*Hangil Park,Yongmin Seo,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a dual-model ensemble approach using knowledge distillation for general anomaly detection, achieving SOTA performance across both industrial inspection and semantic anomaly detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods are biased towards industrial inspection and struggle with generalization across different anomaly types (patch-level defects vs. semantic anomalies). There's a need for a unified approach that works well in both domains.

Method: Uses a teacher-student framework with two specialized student models: an Encoder-Decoder model for industrial AD (patch-level defects) and an Encoder-Encoder model for semantic AD. Both share a DINOv2 encoder and are trained using Noisy-OR objective, with final anomaly scores computed via joint probability of local and semantic scores.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on 8 benchmarks: 99.7% AUROC on MVTec-AD (industrial) and 97.8% on CIFAR-10 (semantic), outperforming both prior general AD models and specialist models in multi-class settings.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-model ensemble approach effectively bridges the gap between industrial and semantic anomaly detection, demonstrating strong generalization across multiple domains and settings (single-class and multi-class).

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in various real-world
applications. Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards
industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic
anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to
address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to
dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to
bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an
Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for
industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both
models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality
feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR
objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability
via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We
evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and
multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial
inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection.
The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in
multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization
across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level
AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better
than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than
the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a zero-shot inference-time optimization method that integrates Laban Effort and Shape components into text-to-motion diffusion models for interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving fine-grained expressive motion control in text-to-motion synthesis is challenging due to limited motion style diversity in datasets and difficulty expressing quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis provides a systematic way to express motion quality details.

Method: A zero-shot inference-time optimization method that updates text embeddings of pretrained diffusion models during sampling to guide motion generation toward desired Laban Effort and Shape components, without requiring additional motion data.

Result: The approach successfully manipulates motion attributes according to target Laban tags, yielding diverse expressive motion qualities while preserving motion identity.

Conclusion: Integrating Laban movement analysis quantification methods enables interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation in text-guided diffusion models.

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having
various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and
animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown
success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive
motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of
motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing
quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has
been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including
motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for
interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly
integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components
into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot,
inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have
desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by
updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling
step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion
qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion
attributes according to target Laban tags.

TL;DR: SCPO is a novel alignment framework for Multimodal Large Language Models that uses semantic curriculum learning to reduce visual hallucinations by up to 62.9% while maintaining general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from visual hallucinations where responses contradict visual evidence, and existing alignment methods like DPO fail to capture fine-grained semantic differences and encourage shortcut learning.

Method: Proposes Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO) with progressive easy-to-hard curriculum using Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, dynamic reference model, and symmetric bidirectional objective for simultaneous learning from textual and visual preferences.

Result: SCPO reduces hallucination rate by up to 62.9% on various hallucination benchmarks, improves factuality while preserving general capabilities, and maintains stable performance across general vision-language benchmarks.

Conclusion: SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics, symmetry, and curriculum for MLLM alignment, effectively mitigating visual hallucinations while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the
performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual
hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual
evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for
alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained
semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these
challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a
novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard
curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which
provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum
is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional
objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual
preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics,
symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual
hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and
versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to
baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the
hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized
benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general
capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general
vision-language benchmarks.

*Julio Hurtado,Haoran Ni,Duygu Sap,Connor Mattinson,Martin Lotz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A selective representation framework for second-hand fashion image retrieval that reduces database size by 90% while maintaining accuracy through clustering, coreset selection, and outlier removal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fashion industry's environmental impact drives interest in second-hand markets, requiring scalable image retrieval systems for large-scale garment valuation.

Method: Uses clustering and coreset selection to identify representative samples, plus a neighbor-homogeneity consistency score for outlier removal before selection.

Result: Maintains near-optimal retrieval accuracy while reducing computational costs by shrinking databases to 10% of original size. Outlier removal further improves performance.

Conclusion: Strategic pruning and selection of representative vectors enables efficient second-hand fashion retrieval with minimal accuracy loss, supporting scalable marketplace operations.

Abstract: The fashion industry has been identified as a major contributor to waste and
emissions, leading to an increased interest in promoting the second-hand
market. Machine learning methods play an important role in facilitating the
creation and expansion of second-hand marketplaces by enabling the large-scale
valuation of used garments. We contribute to this line of work by addressing
the scalability of second-hand image retrieval from databases. By introducing a
selective representation framework, we can shrink databases to 10% of their
original size without sacrificing retrieval accuracy. We first explore
clustering and coreset selection methods to identify representative samples
that capture the key features of each garment and its internal variability.
Then, we introduce an efficient outlier removal method, based on a
neighbour-homogeneity consistency score measure, that filters out
uncharacteristic samples prior to selection. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets: DeepFashion Attribute, DeepFashion Con2Shop, and DeepFashion2.
The results demonstrate a clear performance-efficiency trade-off by
strategically pruning and selecting representative vectors of images. The
retrieval system maintains near-optimal accuracy, while greatly reducing
computational costs by reducing the images added to the vector database.
Furthermore, applying our outlier removal method to clustering techniques
yields even higher retrieval performance by removing non-discriminative samples
before the selection.

### [269] [CMT: Mid-Training for Efficient Learning of Consistency, Mean Flow, and Flow Map Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24526)
*Zheyuan Hu,Chieh-Hsin Lai,Yuki Mitsufuji,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) - a lightweight intermediate stage between diffusion pre-training and flow map training that enables stable, efficient few-step generation with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow map models like Consistency Models and Mean Flow suffer from unstable training, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and high computational costs, even when initialized from pre-trained diffusion models.

Method: CMT trains a model to map points along a solver trajectory from a pre-trained diffusion model directly to the solver-generated clean sample, creating a trajectory-consistent and stable initialization for subsequent flow map training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art two-step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10, 1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98% less training data and GPU time compared to Consistency Models.

Conclusion: CMT establishes a principled, efficient, and general framework for training flow map models, enabling fast robust convergence without heuristics and significantly reducing total training time.

Abstract: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable
few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion
models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and
costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still
requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving
instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and
practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the
(diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training)
for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact
and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver
trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to
the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable
initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based
baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing
post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning.
Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10,
1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98%
less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT
reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared
to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient,
and general framework for training flow map models.

*Mohamad Amin Mirzaei,Pantea Amoie,Ali Ekhterachian,Matin Mirzababaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved method for zero-shot 3D semantic mapping using refined object masks from SemanticSAM and context-aware CLIP encoding to address fragmentation and semantic inaccuracies in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for zero-shot 3D semantic mapping produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to direct use of raw masks from vision-language models, limiting effectiveness in complex environments.

Method: Uses SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement for more accurate object-level masks, and employs context-aware CLIP encoding with multiple contextual views and empirical weighting for richer semantic context.

Result: Experimental evaluation on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks shows significant improvements over existing methods in 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses limitations of existing methods through refined mask generation and enhanced semantic context, demonstrating superior performance in 3D scene understanding tasks.

Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics,
supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent
approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning
embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language
models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often
produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct
use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To
address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement
to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the
over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla
SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance
semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that
integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined
weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on
multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and
object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: EQUISeg is a multimodal segmentation framework that addresses modality imbalance through equal encoding and a self-guided module for robust performance under degraded conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal segmentation methods suffer from imbalanced modal dependencies, where performance degrades significantly when a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes EQUISeg with four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block (CMTB) for efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection, plus a Self-guided Module (SGM) with mutual guidance mechanism for adaptive modality contribution adjustment.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show EQUISeg achieves significant performance gains and effectively alleviates modality imbalance effects in segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: EQUISeg successfully balances modality contributions and enhances robustness in multimodal semantic segmentation, addressing the critical challenge of modality imbalance.

Abstract: Multimodal semantic segmentation enhances model robustness by exploiting
cross-modal complementarities. However, existing methods often suffer from
imbalanced modal dependencies, where overall performance degrades significantly
once a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios. Thus, modality
balance has become acritical challenge for practical multimodal segmentation.
To address this issue, we propose EQUISeg, a multimodal segmentation framework
that balances modality contributions through equal encoding of modalities.
Built upon a four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block(CMTB), EQUISeg enables
efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection. Furthermore, we design
a Self-guided Module(SGM) that mitigates modality imbalance by introducing a
mutual guidance mechanism, enabling each modality to adaptively adjust its
contribution and enhance robustness under degraded conditions. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that EQUISeg achieves significant
performance gains and effectively alleviates the adverse effects of modality
imbalance in segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CLIP text encoders often fail in complex scenes with many objects, requiring better methods for enforcing object counts and spatial layouts while accommodating diverse categories.

Method: QL-Adapter consists of ILFM (fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens) and CMAM (injects image features into text branch). Built QL-Dataset benchmark for quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit).

Result: QL-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on QL-Edit and significantly outperforms existing models in multiple object editing tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses complex multi-object editing challenges through layout fusion and cross-modal augmentation, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Instruction driven image editing with standard CLIP text encoders often fails
in complex scenes with many objects. We present QL-Adapter, a framework for
multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts
and spatial layouts, and accommodating diverse categories. QL-Adapter consists
of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal
Augmentation Module (CMAM). ILFM fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from
the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM
injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and
improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that
spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of
quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments
show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and
significantly outperforms existing models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPLICE is a human-curated benchmark from COIN dataset that evaluates event-based reasoning across temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and knowledge dimensions. It shows VLMs significantly underperform humans in rearranging event sequences, relying more on language priors than visual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe event-based reasoning capabilities across multiple dimensions and assess the gap between human and machine visual reasoning, particularly in understanding event sequences from instructional videos.

Method: Created SPLICE benchmark with 3,381 human-filtered videos from 12 categories, segmented into 11,423 event clips. Evaluated both humans and state-of-the-art VLMs on rearranging clips into coherent sequences, with and without human-annotated textual descriptions.

Result: Significant performance gap: VLMs struggle to match human performance. Human-annotated descriptions improve model accuracy but don't affect human performance. VLMs perform better on temporal/causal reasoning tasks than contextual/spatial ones, and better on everyday tasks than specialized ones.

Conclusion: VLMs rely more on language priors than visual understanding, and even with annotations fall short of human-level reasoning, highlighting persistent challenges in visual reasoning that require deeper understanding beyond language cues.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SPLICE, a human-curated benchmark derived from the
COIN instructional video dataset, designed to probe event-based reasoning
across multiple dimensions: temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and general
knowledge. SPLICE includes 3,381 human-filtered videos spanning 12 categories
and 180 sub-categories, such as sports, engineering, and housework. These
videos are segmented into a total of 11,423 event clips. We evaluate both human
participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the task of
rearranging these clips into coherent event sequences to assess visual
reasoning capabilities. Results reveal a significant gap: VLMs struggle to
match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve
model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models
rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with
annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent
challenges in visual reasoning. A deeper analysis across sub-categories shows
that VLMs perform relatively better on videos where temporal and causal
reasoning are dominant, compared to those where contextual and spatial
reasoning are dominant. They also perform better on everyday tasks than on
specialized ones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides the first unified theoretical and experimental comparison between Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching models, showing that Diffusion Bridge has lower cost functions and more stable trajectories, while Flow Matching becomes less effective with reduced training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is confusion about which approach (Diffusion Bridge vs Flow Matching) is generally preferable, and substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions have hindered unified theoretical understanding of their relative merits.

Method: Recast both frameworks through Stochastic Optimal Control and Optimal Transport perspectives, propose a novel Diffusion Bridge architecture using latent Transformer, and implement Flow Matching with the same structure for fair comparison across multiple tasks.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows Diffusion Bridge has lower cost function guiding toward more stable trajectories, while Flow Matching interpolation coefficients become ineffective with reduced training data. Experimental results across 6 tasks confirm theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The study systematically delineates the respective advantages and disadvantages of Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching models, providing clear guidance on when to prefer each approach based on distributional discrepancy and training data size.

Abstract: Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching have both demonstrated compelling
empirical performance in transformation between arbitrary distributions.
However, there remains confusion about which approach is generally preferable,
and the substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions and practical
implementations have hindered a unified theoretical account of their relative
merits. We have, for the first time, provided a unified theoretical and
experimental validation of these two models. We recast their frameworks through
the lens of Stochastic Optimal Control and prove that the cost function of the
Diffusion Bridge is lower, guiding the system toward more stable and natural
trajectories. Simultaneously, from the perspective of Optimal Transport,
interpolation coefficients $t$ and $1-t$ of Flow Matching become increasingly
ineffective when the training data size is reduced. To corroborate these
theoretical claims, we propose a novel, powerful architecture for Diffusion
Bridge built on a latent Transformer, and implement a Flow Matching model with
the same structure to enable a fair performance comparison in various
experiments. Comprehensive experiments are conducted across Image Inpainting,
Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks,
systematically varying both the distributional discrepancy (different
difficulty) and the training data size. Extensive empirical results align
perfectly with our theoretical predictions and allow us to delineate the
respective advantages and disadvantages of these two models. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve key challenges in crowd counting under foggy conditions including long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast attenuation caused by complex meteorological conditions.

Method: Combines differentiable atmospheric scattering model with transmittance estimation and scattering parameter calibration, introduces MSA-KAN based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem for edge activation, and proposes weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices.

Result: Achieves 12.2%-27.5% reduction in MAE metrics compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios across four public datasets.

Conclusion: The synergistic optimization of physical mechanisms and data-driven approaches significantly improves crowd counting accuracy under complex foggy conditions.

Abstract: Aiming at the key challenges of crowd counting in foggy environments, such as
long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast
attenuation, this paper proposes a crowd-counting method with a physical a
priori of atmospheric scattering, which improves crowd counting accuracy under
complex meteorological conditions through the synergistic optimization of the
physical mechanism and data-driven.Specifically, first, the method introduces a
differentiable atmospheric scattering model and employs transmittance dynamic
estimation and scattering parameter adaptive calibration techniques to
accurately quantify the nonlinear attenuation laws of haze on targets with
different depths of field.Secondly, the MSA-KAN was designed based on the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to construct a learnable edge
activation function. By integrating a multi-layer progressive architecture with
adaptive skip connections, it significantly enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capability in feature-degraded regions, effectively suppressing
feature confusion under fog interference.Finally, we further propose a
weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices using
deep features extracted by MSA-KAN. Experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves a 12.2\%-27.5\% reduction in MAE metrics
compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios.

TL;DR: SANA-Video is an efficient diffusion model for generating high-resolution, minute-long videos with fast speed, deployable on consumer GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a cost-effective video generation model that can produce high-quality, long videos efficiently without requiring massive computational resources.

Method: Uses Linear DiT with linear attention for efficiency and a constant-memory KV cache for block linear attention to enable long video generation with global context.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models while being 16x faster, with training cost reduced to 1% of MovieGen and deployable on RTX 5090 GPUs.

Conclusion: SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video generation with efficient deployment on consumer hardware.

Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently
generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration.
SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with
strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090
GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video
generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,
which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens
processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear
Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video
generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative
properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with
global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional
KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we
explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the
training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of
MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance
compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B
and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover,
SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating
the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x
speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video
generation.

*Zhifang Zhang,Qiqi Tao,Jiaqi Lv,Na Zhao,Lei Feng,Joey Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenSwap is a stealthy backdoor attack on LVLMs that disrupts object relationship understanding rather than using fixed target patterns, making it harder to detect than traditional backdoor attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs use fixed target patterns that are easily detectable due to model overconfidence on frequent patterns. TokenSwap aims to create more evasive attacks by targeting compositional understanding.

Method: TokenSwap injects visual triggers into training samples and simultaneously swaps grammatical roles of key tokens in textual answers. It uses an adaptive token-weighted loss to emphasize learning of swapped tokens, associating visual triggers with bags-of-words behavior.

Result: Extensive experiments show TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM architectures.

Conclusion: TokenSwap demonstrates that backdoor attacks focusing on disrupting compositional understanding rather than fixed patterns can be more effective and harder to detect in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to
backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim
model to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or
replaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are
relatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such
frequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on
these targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce
TokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the
compositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed
targeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object
relationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate
outputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their
relationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap
injects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the
grammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However,
the poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones,
making it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address
this, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly
emphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and
bags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior
evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM
architectures.

Result: Explicit perception, especially when paired with textual cues, consistently yields the best improvements, particularly for smaller models. VTPerception-R1 significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal reasoning, demonstrating that decoupling perception from reasoning with explicit strategies leads to better performance.

Motivation: Robots need accurate object pose estimation in open environments where they encounter unknown objects, requiring semantic understanding to generalize beyond known categories.

Method: Combines DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise model for point normals, using cross-attention to inject continuous semantic priors for learning canonicalized object coordinate systems.

Result: Outperforms state of the art in synthetically trained category-level object pose estimation with 31.9% relative improvement on 5°5cm metric, and achieves up to 100% success rate in grasping unseen objects from unknown categories.

Conclusion: SCOPE successfully bridges the Sim2Real gap and enables generalization beyond known object categories through continuous semantic priors, making it effective for real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Object manipulation requires accurate object pose estimation. In open

combining these DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise

pose estimation. Furthermore, injecting the continuous semantic priors via
cross-attention enables SCOPE to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems
across object instances beyond the distribution of known categories. SCOPE
outperforms the current state of the art in synthetically trained
category-level object pose estimation, achieving a relative improvement of
31.9\% on the 5$^\circ$5cm metric. Additional experiments on two instance-level
datasets demonstrate generalization beyond known object categories, enabling
grasping of unseen objects from unknown categories with a success rate of up to
100\%. Code available: https://github.com/hoenigpeter/scope.

### [281] [Causal-Adapter: Taming Text-to-Image Diffusion for Faithful Counterfactual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24798)
*Lei Tong,Zhihua Liu,Chaochao Lu,Dino Oglic,Tom Diethe,Philip Teare,Sotirios A. Tsaftaris,Chen Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Causal-Adapter is a modular framework that adapts frozen text-to-image diffusion models for counterfactual image generation by enabling causal interventions on target attributes while preserving image identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches rely on prompt engineering without explicit causal structure, lacking precise control over causal relationships and attribute propagation in counterfactual image generation.

Method: Leverages structural causal modeling with two attribute regularization strategies: prompt-aligned injection for semantic control and conditioned token contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious correlations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 91% MAE reduction on Pendulum for accurate attribute control and 87% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity MRI image generation.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust, generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and strong identity preservation.

Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen
text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our
method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently
propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core
identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt
engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages
structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization
strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with
textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token
contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious
correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91\% MAE reduction on Pendulum
for accurate attribute control and 87\% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity
MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust,
generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and
strong identity preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull Morphable Model (BFSM) that enables shape inference between faces and skulls through a shared coefficient space, addressing data scarcity and registration challenges while supporting medical applications like surgical planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in joint face-skull modeling including scarce paired data, registration inaccuracies, limited clinical applications, and underrepresentation of craniofacial deformities.

Method: Constructed a dataset of 200+ samples with CT-based skulls, CT-based faces, and textured face scans; developed dense ray matching registration for topological consistency; built BFSM with shared coefficient space and tissue thickness modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm the robustness and accuracy of the method, enabling bidirectional shape inference and supporting one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull.

Conclusion: BFSM demonstrates significant potential for medical applications including 3D face-skull reconstruction from single images and surgical planning prediction, with the model being publicly available.

Abstract: Building a joint face-skull morphable model holds great potential for
applications such as remote diagnostics, surgical planning, medical education,
and physically based facial simulation. However, realizing this vision is
constrained by the scarcity of paired face-skull data, insufficient
registration accuracy, and limited exploration of reconstruction and clinical
applications. Moreover, individuals with craniofacial deformities are often
overlooked, resulting in underrepresentation and limited inclusivity. To
address these challenges, we first construct a dataset comprising over 200
samples, including both normal cases and rare craniofacial conditions. Each
case contains a CT-based skull, a CT-based face, and a high-fidelity textured
face scan. Secondly, we propose a novel dense ray matching registration method
that ensures topological consistency across face, skull, and their tissue
correspondences. Based on this, we introduce the 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull
Morphable Model (BFSM), which enables shape inference between the face and
skull through a shared coefficient space, while also modeling tissue thickness
variation to support one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull,
reflecting individual changes such as fat over time. Finally, we demonstrate
the potential of BFSM in medical applications, including 3D face-skull
reconstruction from a single image and surgical planning prediction. Extensive
experiments confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method. BFSM is

### [283] [Comprehensive Benchmarking of YOLOv11 Architectures for Scalable and Granular Peripheral Blood Cell Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24595)
*Mohamad Abou Ali,Mariam Abdulfattah,Baraah Al Hussein,Fadi Dornaika,Ali Cherry,Mohamad Hajj-Hassan,Lara Hamawy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comprehensive evaluation of YOLOv11 models for blood cell detection shows YOLOv11 Medium achieves best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, with mAP@0.5 of 0.934.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual peripheral blood smear analysis is labor-intensive and subjective, creating need for automated deep learning alternatives. Systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models like YOLOv11 for fine-grained PBS detection is lacking.

Method: Curated large-scale annotated dataset (16,891 images, 12 PBC classes + RBC class, 298,850 cells). Evaluated five YOLOv11 variants (Nano to XLarge) under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) using mAP, precision, recall, F1 score, and computational efficiency metrics.

Result: YOLOv11 Medium achieved best trade-off with mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under 8:1:1 split. Larger models provided only marginal accuracy gains at substantially higher computational cost. 8:1:1 split consistently outperformed 7:2:1 split across all models.

Conclusion: YOLOv11, particularly the Medium variant, is highly effective for automated fine-grained PBS detection. The publicly released dataset provides valuable resource for advancing blood cell detection research in hematology.

Abstract: Manual peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis is labor intensive and
subjective. While deep learning offers a promising alternative, a systematic
evaluation of state of the art models such as YOLOv11 for fine grained PBS
detection is still lacking. In this work, we make two key contributions. First,
we curate a large scale annotated dataset for blood cell detection and
classification, comprising 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell (PBC)
classes, along with the red blood cell class, all carefully re annotated for
object detection tasks. In total, the dataset contains 298,850 annotated cells.
Second, we leverage this dataset to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five
YOLOv11 variants (ranging from Nano to XLarge). These models are rigorously
benchmarked under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) and
systematically assessed using multiple performance criteria, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, F1 score, and computational
efficiency. Our experiments show that the YOLOv11 Medium variant achieves the
best trade off, reaching a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger
models (Large and XLarge) provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially
higher computational cost. Moreover, the 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms
the 7:2:1 split across all models. These findings highlight YOLOv11,
particularly the Medium variant, as a highly effective framework for automated,
fine grained PBS detection. Beyond benchmarking, our publicly released dataset
(github.com/Mohamad-AbouAli/OI-PBC-Dataset) offers a valuable resource to
advance research on blood cell detection and classification in hematology.

*Bikash Kumar Badatya,Vipul Baghel,Jyotirmoy Amin,Ravi Hegde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel unsupervised framework using structured optimal transport with ASTGCN for automatic temporal segmentation of javelin-throw motion phases, achieving 71.02% mAP and 74.61% F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional motion analysis methods are manual, time-consuming, costly, and lack scalability. Need automatic extraction of kinetic variables without expensive manual labeling.

Method: Unsupervised framework combining structured optimal transport (SOT) with Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN) for contextually aware temporal segmentation of javelin-throw motion phases.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods with 71.02% mean average precision and 74.61% F1-score on test data. Also released new dataset of 211 annotated professional javelin-throw videos.

Conclusion: Proposed framework enables automatic identification of motion phase transitions without manual labeling, providing scalable solution for sports analytics.

Abstract: Precise analysis of athletic motion is central to sports analytics,
particularly in disciplines where nuanced biomechanical phases directly impact
performance outcomes. Traditional analytics techniques rely on manual
annotation or laboratory-based instrumentation, which are time-consuming,
costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of relevant kinetic
variables requires a robust and contextually appropriate temporal segmentation.
Considering the specific case of elite javelin-throw, we present a novel
unsupervised framework for such a contextually aware segmentation, which
applies the structured optimal transport (SOT) concept to augment the
well-known Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network
(ASTGCN). This enables the identification of motion phase transitions without
requiring expensive manual labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving 71.02%
mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially
higher than competing baselines. We also release a new dataset of 211 manually
annotated professional javelin-throw videos with frame-level annotations,
covering key biomechanical phases: approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.

*Yuhan Zhu,Xiangyu Zeng,Chenting Wang,Xinhao Li,Yicheng Xu,Ziang Yan,Yi Wang,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeRet is a plug-and-play framework that enables off-the-shelf multimodal LLMs to perform retrieval without additional training, using semantic embeddings for candidate search and reasoning for reranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs require heavy post-hoc training to become contrastive encoders for retrieval, creating a gap in their use as generalists. This work explores whether pretrained MLLMs can serve as retrievers without training.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) derives semantically grounded embeddings directly from MLLMs for fast candidate search, 2) exploits reasoning ability for precise reranking. Key innovations include bypassing lexical alignment, conditioning representation generation with priors, and mitigating framing effects.

Result: On MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. It scales across MLLM families and sizes while preserving generative abilities.

Conclusion: Pretrained MLLMs, when carefully harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a critical gap in their role as generalists and unifying retrieval, reranking, and generation in end-to-end RAG.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are emerging as versatile
foundations for mixed-modality retrieval. Yet, they often require heavy
post-hoc training to convert them into contrastive encoders for retrieval. This
work asks: Can off-the-shelf MLLMs serve as powerful retrievers without
additional training? We present FreeRet, a plug-and-play framework that turns
any MLLM into a two-stage retriever. FreeRet first derives semantically
grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, and then
exploits its reasoning ability for precise reranking. The framework contributes
three advances: bypassing lexical alignment layers to obtain semantically
faithful embeddings, conditioning representation generation with explicit
priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing.
On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially
outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. Beyond benchmarks, FreeRet is
model-agnostic and scales seamlessly across MLLM families and sizes, preserves
their generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and
unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG within a
single model. Our findings demonstrate that pretrained MLLMs, when carefully
harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a
critical gap in their role as generalists.

*Abu Hanif Muhammad Syarubany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses vehicle type recognition with class imbalance by creating a 16-class dataset and testing various rebalancing methods and models, finding that deep CNNs outperform ensembles but still struggle with severely underrepresented classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Severe class imbalance in public vehicle datasets suppresses performance on rare categories, limiting the effectiveness of intelligent transportation and logistics systems.

Method: Created a 16-class corpus (~47k images) by merging multiple sources, generated six balanced variants using SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling, and benchmarked lightweight ensembles (Random Forest, AdaBoost, soft-voting) against a configurable ResNet-style CNN with strong augmentation and label smoothing.

Result: Best ensemble (SMOTE-combined) achieved 74.8% test accuracy, while CNN achieved 79.19% on full test set and 81.25% on unseen inference batch. The most under-represented class (Barge) remained a failure mode despite rebalancing efforts.

Conclusion: Deep models have advantage over ensembles, but rebalancing alone has limits. Future work should prioritize additional minority-class collection, cost-sensitive objectives like focal loss, and hybrid ensemble-CNN pipelines to combine interpretability with representational power.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle type recognition underpins intelligent transportation and
logistics, but severe class imbalance in public datasets suppresses performance
on rare categories. We curate a 16-class corpus (~47k images) by merging
Kaggle, ImageNet, and web-crawled data, and create six balanced variants via
SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling. Lightweight ensembles, such as
Random Forest, AdaBoost, and a soft-voting combiner built on MobileNet-V2
features are benchmarked against a configurable ResNet-style CNN trained with
strong augmentation and label smoothing. The best ensemble (SMOTE-combined)
attains 74.8% test accuracy, while the CNN achieves 79.19% on the full test set
and 81.25% on an unseen inference batch, confirming the advantage of deep
models. Nonetheless, the most under-represented class (Barge) remains a failure
mode, highlighting the limits of rebalancing alone. Results suggest
prioritizing additional minority-class collection and cost-sensitive objectives
(e.g., focal loss) and exploring hybrid ensemble or CNN pipelines to combine
interpretability with representational power.

TL;DR: OpenGPT-4o-Image is a large-scale dataset that addresses limitations in multimodal training data through hierarchical task taxonomy and automated generation, achieving significant performance improvements in image generation and editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for multimodal models lack systematic structure and challenging scenarios needed for real-world applications, constraining model performance in image generation and editing.

Method: Combines hierarchical task taxonomy with automated data generation using structured resource pools and GPT-4o, creating 80k instruction-image pairs across 11 domains and 51 subtasks including scientific imagery and complex instruction editing.

Result: Fine-tuning on the dataset achieves up to 18% improvement on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench) and 13% improvement on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval).

Conclusion: Systematic data construction is crucial for advancing multimodal AI capabilities, and the proposed methodology effectively addresses data quality and comprehensiveness bottlenecks.

Abstract: The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing
is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their
training data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style
transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic
structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset
constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy
with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental
capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces
highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for
chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous
execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging
structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality
instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains
and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on
our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks,
with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench)
and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that
systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

*Zhu,Libo,Zhou,Zihan,Liu,Xiaoyang,Zhang,Weihang,Shi,Keyu,Fu,Yifan,Zhang,Yulun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIFLE is a diffusion-based framework that removes flicker-banding artifacts from photos of emissive displays while preserving fine details, using a flicker-banding prior estimator and masked loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flicker-banding artifacts frequently degrade photos of emissive displays due to temporal aliasing between camera rolling-shutter and display modulation, but this problem remains underexplored compared to moire degradation.

Method: Proposes RIFLE framework with flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) to predict banding attributes and inject them into restoration network, plus masked loss to focus supervision on banded regions. Also develops simulation pipeline to synthesize realistic FB artifacts with stochastic parameters.

Result: RIFLE consistently outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines across quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on real-world dataset, from mild to severe flicker-banding cases.

Conclusion: This is the first work to research simulation and removal of flicker-banding, establishing foundation for subsequent research in dataset construction and removal model design.

Abstract: Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs
of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is
alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between
a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation.
Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains
underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and
perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and
introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement,
RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine
details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key
banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally,
Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions
without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a
simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic
jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered
boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation.
For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned
banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics
and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently
outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe
flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research
the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for
subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model
design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

TL;DR: Seg-CFT is a method for generating counterfactual medical images that enables structure-specific interventions without requiring pixel-level label maps, addressing limitations of previous approaches that cause undesirable global effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current counterfactual image generation methods rely on external classifiers or regressors and are insufficient for structure-specific interventions, often causing undesirable global effects. Previous approaches requiring pixel-level label maps are tedious and difficult to obtain.

Method: Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT) preserves the simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while producing locally coherent counterfactuals without needing hypothetical segmentations.

Result: The method demonstrates capability of generating realistic chest radiographs and shows promising results for modeling coronary artery disease.

Conclusion: Seg-CFT provides an effective approach for structure-specific counterfactual image generation that overcomes limitations of previous methods, enabling better data augmentation, de-biasing, and disease modeling.

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training
data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on
external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of
subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For
structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a
chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in
undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used
pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical
segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose
Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the
simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while
producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the
capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising
results for modeling coronary artery disease. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This thesis introduces SlotAdapt, a framework that adapts pretrained diffusion models for object-centric synthesis while maintaining their generative capacity, enabling fine-grained control over individual objects in both images and videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. The goal is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete objects for controllable generation.

Method: Integrates lightweight, slot-based conditioning into pretrained diffusion models. For images: uses register token for background/style and slot-conditioned modules for objects. For videos: employs Invariant Slot Attention (ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal aggregator.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation, compositional editing, and controllable image generation. For videos, establishes new benchmarks in unsupervised video object segmentation and reconstruction, supporting advanced editing tasks like object removal, replacement, and insertion.

Conclusion: Establishes a general and scalable approach to object-centric generative modeling that bridges human object-based perception with machine learning, expanding possibilities for interactive and structured generative tools.

Abstract: A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete
objects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet
leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text
conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis
introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for
object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity.
  We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with
disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based
conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while
providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments
diffusion models with a register token for background/style and
slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and
achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation,
compositional editing, and controllable image generation.
  We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention
(ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal
aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and
dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object
segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as
object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.
  Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to
object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human
object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for
interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative,
scientific, and practical domains.

TL;DR: The paper investigates scaling GANs by training in VAE latent space and using transformer-based architectures, addressing scaling issues with intermediate supervision and width-aware learning rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore scalability principles for GANs, which have been underexplored compared to other generative models, by leveraging effective design choices from other generative approaches.

Method: Proposes GAT - a purely transformer-based GAN trained in VAE latent space, with lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning rate adjustment to address scaling issues.

Result: GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art FID of 2.96 on ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs (6x fewer than baselines), with reliable training across various model capacities (S through XL).

Conclusion: GANs can be effectively scaled using latent-space training and transformer architectures, achieving strong performance with significantly reduced training time when proper scaling solutions are implemented.

Abstract: Scalability has driven recent advances in generative modeling, yet its
principles remain underexplored for adversarial learning. We investigate the
scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design
choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models:
training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely
transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space
enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this
efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales
with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes
that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as
underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability
as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly
solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate
adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and
latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of
capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art
single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on
ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.

TL;DR: A classifier-centric adaptive framework with lightweight text adapter and layered asymmetric initialization improves open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation by enhancing classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires strong generalization to unseen categories, and analysis shows classification components significantly impact overall segmentation performance.

Method: Proposed classifier-centric adaptive framework with lightweight text adapter using layered asymmetric initialization to enhance classification capabilities.

Result: Substantial improvements over OVCoser baseline: cIoU increased from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658, cMAE reduced from 0.336 to 0.239 on OVCamo benchmark.

Conclusion: Targeted classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing camouflaged object segmentation performance in open-vocabulary settings.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires models to segment
camouflaged objects of arbitrary categories unseen during training, placing
extremely high demands on generalization capabilities. Through analysis of
existing methods, it is observed that the classification component
significantly affects overall segmentation performance. Accordingly, a
classifier-centric adaptive framework is proposed to enhance segmentation
performance by improving the classification component via a lightweight text
adapter with a novel layered asymmetric initialization. Through the
classification enhancement, the proposed method achieves substantial
improvements in segmentation metrics compared to the OVCoser baseline on the
OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increases from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658,
and cMAE reduces from 0.336 to 0.239. These results demonstrate that targeted
classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an automated segmentation pipeline for traumatic brain injury (TBI) lesions using nnUNet framework with post-processing, achieving competitive results in the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TBI lesions are extremely heterogeneous in size, number, and laterality, complicating neuroimaging analysis tasks like registration and brain parcellation, which reduces analytical accuracy.

Method: The pipeline uses various nnUNet architectures for initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance evaluation metrics.

Result: Achieved accuracy of 0.8451, Dice scores of 0.4711 (images with lesions) and 0.8514 (images without lesions), with overall Dice score of 0.5973, ranking among top-6 methods in AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge.

Conclusion: The developed automated segmentation pipeline effectively addresses TBI lesion heterogeneity and provides reliable neuroimaging analysis, with publicly available Python implementation.

Abstract: The identification and segmentation of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury
(TBI) lesions pose a significant challenge in neuroimaging. This difficulty
arises from the extreme heterogeneity of these lesions, which vary in size,
number, and laterality, thereby complicating downstream image processing tasks
such as image registration and brain parcellation, reducing the analytical
accuracy. Thus, developing methods for highly accurate segmentation of TBI
lesions is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis. This study aims to
develop an effective automated segmentation pipeline to automatically detect
and segment TBI lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans. We evaluate multiple
approaches to achieve accurate segmentation of the TBI lesions. The core of our
pipeline leverages various architectures within the nnUNet framework for

*Max Curie,Paulo da Costa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLASP is a lightweight unsupervised image segmentation framework that uses self-supervised ViT features, spectral clustering, automatic segment count selection, and boundary refinement without any training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a training-free, easily reproducible baseline for unsupervised image segmentation that can handle large unannotated datasets common in digital advertising and marketing workflows.

Method: Extracts patch features using DINO ViT encoder, builds affinity matrix, applies spectral clustering with automatic eigengap silhouette search for segment count, and refines boundaries with DenseCRF.

Result: Achieves competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines despite requiring no training.

Conclusion: CLASP provides a strong, simple, and training-free baseline for unsupervised segmentation that is particularly useful for applications like brand safety screening and content moderation.

Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a
lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without
any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a
self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and
applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment
count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the
boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training
free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff
and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design
makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated
corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such
as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content
moderation

### [295] [Enhancing Physical Plausibility in Video Generation by Reasoning the Implausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24702)
*Yutong Hao,Chen Chen,Ajmal Saeed Mian,Chang Xu,Daochang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework that improves physical plausibility in video generation by using physics-aware reasoning to create counterfactual prompts and a novel guidance strategy to suppress implausible content during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for video generation learn physics implicitly from large datasets, which is costly, difficult to scale, and still produces motions that violate physical laws. There's a need for explicit physical reasoning without additional training.

Method: Uses a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to create counterfactual prompts encoding physics-violating behaviors. Proposes Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG) with synchronized directional normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias.

Result: Experiments across different physical domains show substantial enhancement in physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism, with no additional training required. Both the physics-aware reasoning component and SDG are validated as complementary and effective.

Conclusion: Establishes a new plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation that explicitly reasons about implausibility and guides generation away from it during inference.

Abstract: Diffusion models can generate realistic videos, but existing methods rely on
implicitly learning physical reasoning from large-scale text-video datasets,
which is costly, difficult to scale, and still prone to producing implausible
motions that violate fundamental physical laws. We introduce a training-free
framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly
reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to
construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating
behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG)
strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional
normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled
denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible
content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising.
Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach
substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism,
despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the
complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and
SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually
validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content
and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and
plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IWR-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating Large Vision-Language Models on interactive webpage reconstruction from videos, addressing limitations of static screenshot-to-code tasks by focusing on dynamic web interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, overlooking dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. The paper aims to address this gap by evaluating models' ability to understand and reconstruct interactive webpages from video.

Method: Introduced IWR-Bench with 113 tasks from 100 real-world websites, featuring 1,001 actions and diverse interaction complexities. Includes user interaction videos and crawled static assets. Uses agent-as-a-judge framework with comprehensive metrics to assess functional correctness and visual fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs show poor performance - best model achieves only 36.35% overall score. Functional correctness (24.39% IFS) significantly lags behind visual fidelity (64.25% VFS), revealing limitations in reasoning about temporal dynamics and synthesizing event-driven logic.

Conclusion: IWR-Bench establishes a challenging frontier for vision-language research, highlighting critical limitations in current models' ability to handle interactive webpage reconstruction from video. The benchmark will be publicly available to advance research in this area.

Abstract: The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations
of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the
dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address
this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for
evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113
meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and
featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles,
and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task
includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets
(e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental
challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from
video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into
functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric
system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of
generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant
challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as
functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity
(64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models'
ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic,
establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.
The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is

*Luis F. W. Batista,Tom Bourbon,Cedric Pradalier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Polarimetric imaging improves floating debris segmentation by mitigating water-surface glare and recovering low-contrast objects, though it increases computational load and may introduce new false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of floating debris on water is compromised by surface glare and changing outdoor illumination, which polarimetric imaging can help mitigate.

Method: Benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks on PoTATO dataset (polarimetric images of plastic bottles in inland waterways) and compare with single-image baselines using traditional models.

Result: Polarimetric cues help recover low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs.

Conclusion: Polarized cameras provide sharper masks but increase computational load and risk of new false positives; benchmark helps researchers determine suitability for their applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of floating debris on water is often compromised by
surface glare and changing outdoor illumination. Polarimetric imaging offers a
single-sensor route to mitigate water-surface glare that disrupts semantic
segmentation of floating objects. We benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks
on PoTATO, a public dataset of polarimetric images of plastic bottles in inland
waterways, and compare their performance with single-image baselines using
traditional models. Our results indicate that polarimetric cues help recover
low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising
mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs. These sharper masks
come at a cost: the additional channels enlarge the models increasing the
computational load and introducing the risk of new false positives. By
providing a reproducible, diagnostic benchmark and publicly available code, we
hope to help researchers choose if polarized cameras are suitable for their
applications and to accelerate related research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monocular depth estimation methods are limited by data scarcity and quality issues, which hinder their robustness and generalization capabilities.

Method: Proposes BRIDGE framework using RL-optimized depth-to-image generation to create synthetic dataset, then trains depth estimation model with hybrid supervision combining teacher pseudo-labels and ground truth depth.

Result: Achieves breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and in complex scene detail capture.

Conclusion: The innovative data generation and training paradigm fosters general and robust depth features, advancing monocular depth estimation capabilities.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a foundational task for computer vision.

model on this dataset, employing a hybrid supervision strategy that integrates
teacher pseudo-labels with ground truth depth for comprehensive and robust

to achieve breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset with 1.5M+ CT-PET images and clinical reports to address gaps in medical VLMs, particularly for PET/CT imaging and low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical VLMs face limitations due to scarce multimodal imaging data (especially PET/CT) and underrepresentation of low-resource languages like Vietnamese, hindering clinical utility and generalizability.

Method: Created a novel Vietnamese dataset with 1,567,062 CT-PET image pairs and 2,757 clinical reports, plus a training framework with data augmentation and expert-validated test sets for benchmarking VLMs.

Result: Incorporating the dataset significantly improved VLM performance on downstream tasks including medical report generation and visual question answering.

Conclusion: The dataset and benchmark advance robust medical VLMs, especially for low-resource languages, enhancing clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.

Abstract: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal
datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence by
enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains,
applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited
availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most
existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus
primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and
clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired
CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This
dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1)
the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which
hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks;
and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the
Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report
pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs'
learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We
conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on
downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question
answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset
significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this
dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development
of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource
languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniLat3D is a unified single-stage 3D generation framework that encodes geometry and appearance in a single latent space, eliminating the need for separate geometry and texture generation stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generation methods use two-stage pipelines that first generate geometry then synthesize appearance, leading to geometry-texture misalignment and high computational costs.

Method: Proposes a geometry-appearance Unified VAE that compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact UniLat representation, and trains a single flow-matching model to generate UniLat directly from Gaussian noise.

Result: UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image, achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The unified single-stage approach successfully addresses geometry-texture misalignment issues and reduces computational costs while maintaining high-quality 3D generation.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While
recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic
content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline
that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled
design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost.
In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry
and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage
generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which
compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation
-- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense
low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D
formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation,
we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into
UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets,
UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image,
achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality. More demos \&
code are available at https://unilat3d.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task using RGB, Depth, and Thermal Infrared modalities, proposes a new RGBDT500 dataset with 500 videos, and develops RDTTrack - a tri-modal tracker that integrates complementary cues through prompt learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal trackers focus on dual-modal paradigms (RGB-D or RGB-Thermal) and struggle in complex scenarios due to limited input modalities. The authors aim to enhance robustness by leveraging three complementary modalities.

Method: Proposed RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information using a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning. It fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities under an orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with RGB signals as prompts for the foundation tracking model.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed tri-modal tracking approach with RGB, Depth, and Thermal Infrared modalities effectively enhances tracking performance and robustness compared to dual-modal methods, demonstrating the value of complementary multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: Existing multi-modal object tracking approaches primarily focus on dual-modal
paradigms, such as RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal, yet remain challenged in complex
scenarios due to limited input modalities. To address this gap, this work
introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary
modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR),
aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we
construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists
of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame
provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise
object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal
tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust
tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning
techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities
under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with
RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model,
effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing
significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of
tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExGS is a feed-forward framework for extreme compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes, achieving over 100× compression while preserving rendering quality through universal Gaussian compression and diffusion-based restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural scene representations like 3DGS have high storage and transmission costs that limit deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing compression methods either require costly optimization or degrade quality under high compression ratios.

Method: ExGS unifies Universal Gaussian Compression (UGC) for re-optimization-free pruning of Gaussian primitives with GaussPainter, which uses diffusion priors and mask-guided refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned scenes.

Result: The framework achieves over 100× compression (reducing 354.77 MB to 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image quality under challenging conditions. It enables real-time restoration through lightweight VAE and one-step diffusion design.

Conclusion: Diffusion priors play a central role in bridging the gap between extreme compression and high-quality neural rendering, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-driven approaches for 3DGS compression.

Abstract: Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have
enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and
transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow
and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which
degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent
data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this
trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering
quality. We introduce \textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that
unifies \textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with
\textbf{GaussPainter} for \textbf{Ex}treme 3D\textbf{GS} compression.
\textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce
Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas
\textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided
refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian
scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing
regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in
degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a
one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can
even achieve over $100\times$ compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model
to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image
quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role
of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and
high-quality neural rendering. Our code repository will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-view geo-localization methods overlook semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities between different viewpoints, leading to poor performance in feature matching.

Method: Uses Google Retrieval Enhancement Module for street image data enhancement, Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation for consistent feature extraction, and integrates 3D scene information from multi-scale UAV images with self-supervised and cross-view contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves 25.75% Recall@1 accuracy on University-1652 dataset in UAVM2025 Challenge, demonstrating robustness and generalization across diverse urban scenarios.

Conclusion: SkyLink effectively addresses viewpoint variation challenges in cross-view geo-localization through enhanced feature retrieval and 3D scene integration, showing superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims at establishing location correspondences
between different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically learn cross-view
correlations through direct feature similarity matching, often overlooking
semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities. To address this
unique problem, we focus on robust feature retrieval under viewpoint variation
and propose the novel SkyLink method. We firstly utilize the Google Retrieval
Enhancement Module to perform data enhancement on street images, which
mitigates the occlusion of the key target due to restricted street viewpoints.
The Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation module is further adopted to emphasize
multiple local feature aggregations to ensure the consistent feature extraction
across viewpoints. Meanwhile, we integrate the 3D scene information constructed
from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge between street and satellite
viewpoints, and perform feature alignment through self-supervised and
cross-view contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate robustness
and generalization across diverse urban scenarios, which achieve 25.75$\%$

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Score identity Distillation (SiD) is successfully extended to text-to-image flow-matching models, showing that score distillation techniques work broadly across diffusion- and flow-based generators without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models produce high-quality images but suffer from slow iterative sampling, while flow matching has been shown theoretically equivalent to diffusion under Gaussian assumptions. The paper investigates whether distillation techniques like score distillation can transfer directly to flow matching models.

Method: The authors provide a simple derivation based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations that unifies Gaussian diffusion and flow matching. They extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models including SANA, SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev with DiT backbones.

Result: Experiments show that with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works out of the box across these models in both data-free and data-aided settings. This provides the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to text-to-image flow matching models.

Conclusion: Score distillation techniques can be successfully applied to flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability and soundness, and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and flow-based generators.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by
slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one-
or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct
framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion
under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation
techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple
derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies
Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations.
Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to
pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium,
SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show
that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works
out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings,
without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides
the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to
text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability
and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and
flow-based generators. We will make the PyTorch implementation publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LOVE-R1 is a Large Video-Language Model that uses adaptive zoom-in mechanism to balance temporal understanding and spatial perception in long videos, outperforming baseline models by 3.1% on average across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and detailed spatial perception in LVLMs, where uniform frame sampling sacrifices either temporal clues or spatial details.

Method: Proposes adaptive zoom-in mechanism: starts with densely sampled frames in small resolution, then zooms in on clips of interest with large resolution through multi-step reasoning. Uses 38k CoT data for finetuning and decoupled reinforcement finetuning for process supervision.

Result: Achieves 3.1% average improvement over Qwen2.5-VL baseline across 4 long video understanding benchmarks, demonstrating better trade-off between sampling density and frame resolutions.

Conclusion: The slow-fast adaptive frame sampling mechanism effectively balances temporal and spatial requirements for long video understanding, with explicit optimization of zoom-in reasoning ability proving successful.

Abstract: Long video understanding is still challenging for recent Large Video-Language
Models (LVLMs) due to the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and
detailed spatial perception. LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism,
which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate,
inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in
suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model
that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with
densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are
needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame
resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The
whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the
reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k
high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning.
As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we
decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize
the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video
understanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame
sampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and
frame resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an
average of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.

Motivation: To understand how visual processing functions are distributed across decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models and leverage this understanding for more efficient model training and data selection.

Method: Proposed Visual Token Swapping framework to analyze layer-specific functions, then developed VFL-LoRA for targeted training and VFL-select for automated data classification based on function alignment.

Result: Identified that visual functions narrow to 2-3 specific layers per function, with consistent ordering across models. VFL-LoRA outperforms full-LoRA and prevents function forgetting. VFL-select achieves 98% performance with only 20% of data and surpasses human experts in data selection.

Conclusion: The study provides deeper understanding of MLLM visual processing, enabling more efficient, interpretable, and robust models through targeted layer manipulation and data selection strategies.

Abstract: This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed
across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition,
narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers
(VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a
consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human
behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then
grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel
analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely
elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights
offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream
applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs
whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform
full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by
analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs
are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling
highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities.
Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and
achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset.
This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering
the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.

*Richeek Das,Kostas Daniilidis,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: F³ (Fast Feature Field) is a novel representation for event-based camera data that learns by predicting future events from past events, enabling efficient processing at 120-440 Hz and achieving state-of-the-art performance on various vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient representations for event-based camera data that can handle the sparsity of events, be robust to noise and varying event rates, and enable downstream vision tasks for robotic applications across diverse conditions.

Method: Learns F³ representation by predicting future events from past events using multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets, exploiting event sparsity and representing events as multi-channel images within spatiotemporal volumes.

Result: Achieves 120 Hz at HD and 440 Hz at VGA resolutions for F³ computation, and 25-75 Hz for downstream tasks. State-of-the-art performance on optical flow, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation across multiple robotic platforms, lighting conditions, environments, and camera sensors.

Conclusion: F³ provides an efficient, robust representation for event-based vision that enables high-performance real-time processing of various computer vision tasks in challenging robotic scenarios.

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building
representations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature
Field ($\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events
from past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion
information. $\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to
noise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas
from multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and
440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous
spatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream
tasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation,
semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from
three robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform),
across different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments
(indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors
(resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at
25-75 Hz at HD resolution.

TL;DR: TACO-Net is a novel 3D object classification method that combines topological data analysis with image filtration techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance on point cloud classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D object classification is important for applications like computer vision, robotics, and autonomous driving, but remains challenging due to the unordered, irregular, and noisy nature of point clouds.

Method: Transform point clouds into voxelized binary 3D images, extract topological features using topological data analysis and image filtration, then train a lightweight 1D CNN on these features.

Result: Achieved 99.05% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 99.52% on ModelNet10, with strong performance on real-world OmniObject3D dataset and high resilience to corrupted inputs.

Conclusion: TACO-Net sets a new state-of-the-art for 3D object classification and demonstrates robustness across synthetic and real-world datasets with strong resilience to noise and corruption.

Abstract: 3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant
practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and
autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds
sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras
have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification
accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and
their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art
(SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data
analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they
are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a
voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next,
we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)
using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework,
TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$
accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and
further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D
dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs,
the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.

*Zeyu Cai,Ziyang Li,Xiaoben Li,Boqian Li,Zeyu Wang,Zhenyu Zhang,Yuliang Xiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UP2You is a tuning-free solution for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from unconstrained 2D photos, handling varying poses, viewpoints, cropping, and occlusions without requiring clean inputs or pre-captured templates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches require clean inputs like full-body images or well-calibrated cross-view captures, limiting practical applications in real-world scenarios with casual, unconstrained human photos.

Method: Introduces a data rectifier paradigm that converts unconstrained inputs into clean orthogonal multi-view images in seconds, with pose-correlated feature aggregation (PCFA) for selective information fusion and a perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor.

Result: Outperforms previous methods with 15% improvement in Chamfer distance, 18% in P2S on PuzzleIOI, and 21% in PSNR, 46% in LPIPS on 4D-Dress. Efficient at 1.5 minutes per person and supports arbitrary pose control and training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on.

Conclusion: UP2You provides a practical solution for real-world 3D portrait reconstruction from casual photos, demonstrating superior geometric accuracy and texture fidelity while being efficient and versatile for various applications.

Abstract: We present UP2You, the first tuning-free solution for reconstructing
high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from extremely unconstrained in-the-wild 2D
photos. Unlike previous approaches that require "clean" inputs (e.g., full-body
images with minimal occlusions, or well-calibrated cross-view captures), UP2You
directly processes raw, unstructured photographs, which may vary significantly
in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion. Instead of compressing data into
tokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier
paradigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal
multi-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D
reconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation
module (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference
images w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly
constant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a
perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for
pre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and
in-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous
methods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and
texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5
minutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and
training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for
real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured. Both models and code
will be released to facilitate future research on this underexplored task.

*Youngeun Kim,Youjia Zhang,Huiling Liu,Aecheon Jung,Sunwoo Lee,Sungeun Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenPruner is a training-free framework that prunes redundant visual tokens in VLMs by selecting tokens with high sensitivity and complementary information, achieving up to 94.4% token reduction and 2.30x faster inference while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token pruning methods have limitations: attention-based approaches are unstable and redundant, while diversity-based methods risk dropping important regions needed for accurate predictions.

Method: Estimates token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at the projection layer, measuring how small random perturbations affect projection outputs to approximate token influence without backpropagation.

Result: Outperforms prior methods across multiple VLMs and benchmarks, pruning up to 94.4% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end inference.

Conclusion: TokenPruner provides an effective training-free solution for efficient multimodal reasoning by selecting influential and complementary tokens through lightweight sensitivity estimation.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable strong multimodal reasoning but
incur heavy inference costs from redundant visual tokens. Token pruning
alleviates this issue, yet existing approaches face limitations.
Attention-based methods rely on raw attention scores, which are often unstable
across layers and heads and can lead to redundant selections. Diversity-based
methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space but
risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose \ours, a
training-free framework built on a simple intuition: tokens with higher
sensitivity are more likely to influence the model's output, and they should
also capture complementary visual cues rather than overlapping information. To
achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at
the projection layer, a shallow and computationally light component of the
model. This approach measures how small random perturbations affect the
projection outputs, allowing us to approximate each token's influence through
lightweight forward passes without backpropagation. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that \ours consistently outperforms
prior methods, pruning up to 94.4\% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and
significantly improving efficiency, achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end
inference over the baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GHOST is a method that automatically generates natural-looking images to induce object hallucinations in MLLMs, achieving high success rates and uncovering transferable vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current static benchmarks for studying object hallucination in MLLMs are limited and cannot uncover model-specific or unanticipated vulnerabilities.

Method: GHOST optimizes in image embedding space to mislead models while keeping target objects absent, then guides a diffusion model to generate natural-looking images with subtle misleading cues.

Result: Achieved hallucination success rate exceeding 28% across various models, with 66.5% transfer rate from Qwen2.5-VL to GPT-4o. Generated images are confirmed high-quality and object-free.

Conclusion: GHOST serves as both a diagnostic tool for uncovering hallucinations and a corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems through fine-tuning.

Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a
persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the
image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with
fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering
model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce
GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method
designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce
hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or
prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to
mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a
diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking
images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original
input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to
hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including
reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success
rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery
methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and
object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST
uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce
hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on
our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and
corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) lack theoretical grounding, limiting robustness and interpretability under head motion and illumination changes.

Method: Derived from Navier-Stokes equations, the method shows pulse signals follow a second-order dynamical system leading to causal convolution. PHASE-Net includes Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper, Adaptive Spatial Filter, and Gated TCN components.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with strong efficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready solution.

Conclusion: PHASE-Net provides a physics-informed paradigm for rPPG that combines theoretical justification with practical efficiency, addressing limitations of existing heuristic approaches.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement enables non-contact
physiological monitoring but suffers from accuracy degradation under head
motion and illumination changes. Existing deep learning methods are mostly
heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, which limits robustness and
interpretability. In this work, we propose a physics-informed rPPG paradigm
derived from the Navier-Stokes equations of hemodynamics, showing that the
pulse signal follows a second-order dynamical system whose discrete solution
naturally leads to a causal convolution. This provides a theoretical
justification for using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Based on this
principle, we design PHASE-Net, a lightweight model with three key components:
(1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper module, which swaps or transposes a few spatial
channels to mix distant facial regions and enhance cross-region feature
interaction without breaking temporal order; (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter, which
learns a soft spatial mask per frame to highlight signal-rich areas and
suppress noise; and (3) Gated TCN, a causal dilated TCN with gating that models
long-range temporal dynamics for accurate pulse recovery. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong
efficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG
solution.

Motivation: Current MDD diagnosis relies on subjective scales, while existing EEG-based deep models treat spectra as static images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore prior knowledge, limiting accuracy and interpretability.

Method: Proposes ELPG-DTFS with three key components: (1) channel-band attention with cross-band mutual information, (2) learnable adjacency matrix for dynamic functional links, and (3) residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting neuroscience priors.

Result: Achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1 score on 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art ACM-GNN. Ablation studies show removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35.

Conclusion: ELPG-DTFS offers a robust and interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics, with all three components providing complementary value.

Abstract: Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital,
yet diagnosis still relies on subjective scales. Electroencephalography (EEG)
provides a low-cost biomarker, but existing deep models treat spectra as static

and interpretability. We propose ELPG-DTFS, a prior-guided adaptive
time-frequency graph neural network that introduces: (1) channel-band attention
with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable adjacency matrix for
dynamic functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting

achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1, surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art

confirming their complementary value. ELPG-DTFS thus offers a robust and

TL;DR: DC-Gen is a framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by using a deeply compressed latent space, achieving 53x speedup for 4K image generation without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models face efficiency challenges at high resolutions like 4K, and previous research rarely addresses latent space redundancy.

Method: Uses a post-training pipeline with lightweight embedding alignment to bridge representation gap between base and compressed latent spaces, followed by minimal LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX achieve comparable quality to base models with 53x latency reduction for 4K generation on H100 GPU, and 138x reduction when combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant.

Conclusion: DC-Gen provides an efficient approach to accelerate high-resolution text-to-image generation by leveraging compressed latent spaces while maintaining model quality.

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality
images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high
resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates
diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy
within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a
general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging
a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch
approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the
quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the
representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply
compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct
fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with
a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are
aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base
model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA
and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve
quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup.
Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on
the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a
4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total
latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model. Code:

Result: Maintains in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions (night, fog, snow) on Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich datasets.

Conclusion: Lightweight, model-agnostic preprocessing enables imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for downstream vision models in safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system's mechanisms for contrast enhancement and
color-opponency, we explore biologically motivated input preprocessing for
robust semantic segmentation. By applying Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG)
filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels, we enhance local
contrast without modifying model architecture or training. Evaluations on
Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich show that such preprocessing maintains
in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions

Motivation: Current MLLMs have limitations in real-time streaming scenarios due to storage constraints of historical visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning.

Method: Proposes Persistent Event Memory Forest that organizes video frames into event-level tree structures using penalty functions, and Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window for detailed short-term visual cues. Also introduces OnlineIT instruction-tuning dataset.

Result: Achieves 77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. Maintains 96.8% accuracy even under extreme visual token compression (1024 tokens).

Conclusion: StreamForest demonstrates robustness, efficiency, and generalizability for streaming video understanding, particularly in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness in real-time
streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical
visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically
designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the
Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes
video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided
by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge
frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited
computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a
Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual
cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an
instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT
significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future
prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce
ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding
in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that
StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of
77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In
particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024
tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks
relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness,
efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video
understanding.

TL;DR: A novel diffusion model for satellite image generation that conditions on environmental context using text, metadata, and visual data, addressing limitations of missing data and user intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for remote sensing face limitations in handling missing data, limited environmental context, and unreliable user intention reflection in generated outputs.

Method: Proposes a diffusion model conditioned on environmental context using three control signals (text, metadata, visual data) with metadata fusion strategy to handle corrupt/missing observations.

Result: Outperforms previous methods qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, quality across 6 metrics) in single-image and temporal generation.

Conclusion: Environmental context conditioning improves foundation model performance for satellite imagery, making the model promising for downstream tasks; introduces first public 3-modal dataset combining these data mediums.

Abstract: Diffusion-based foundation models have recently garnered much attention in
the field of generative modeling due to their ability to generate images of
high quality and fidelity. Although not straightforward, their recent
application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials
towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing
multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face
considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle
with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user
intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion
model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite
images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals:
a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the
proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition
satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its
control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models
attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or
missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both
qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThermalGen is an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-to-thermal image translation that addresses the scarcity of synchronized RGB-thermal data through style-disentangled conditioning and large-scale dataset curation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of synchronized and calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle for visual-thermal sensor fusion and cross-modality tasks, motivating the need for RGB-to-thermal image translation to synthesize thermal images from abundant RGB datasets.

Method: Proposed ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model with RGB image conditioning architecture and style-disentangled mechanism, trained on eight public and three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets captured across diverse conditions.

Result: Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions, enabling better training for cross-modality tasks.

Abstract: Paired RGB-thermal data is crucial for visual-thermal sensor fusion and
cross-modality tasks, including important applications such as multi-modal
image alignment and retrieval. However, the scarcity of synchronized and
calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle to progress in
these areas. To overcome this challenge, RGB-to-Thermal (RGB-T) image
translation has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the synthesis of
thermal images from abundant RGB datasets for training purposes. In this study,
we propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image
translation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a
style-disentangled mechanism. To support large-scale training, we curated eight
public satellite-aerial, aerial, and ground RGB-T paired datasets, and
introduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets--DJI-day,
Bosonplus-day, and Bosonplus-night--captured across diverse times, sensor
types, and geographic regions. Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T
benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior
translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based
methods. To our knowledge, ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation
model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant
variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

### [321] [VAGUEGAN: Stealthy Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks on Image Generative Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24891)
*Mostafa Mohaimen Akand Faisal,Rabeya Amin Jhuma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VagueGAN introduces a stealthy poisoning attack on generative models (GANs and diffusion models) that uses optimized perturbations to cause targeted changes in generated images while maintaining or even improving visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore adversarial attacks on generative pipelines where small perturbations lead to controlled output changes, which is less studied compared to attacks on discriminative models.

Method: Combines a modular perturbation network (PoisonerNet) with Generator-Discriminator pairs to craft stealthy triggers, evaluated using custom proxy metrics and perceptual/frequency domain analysis.

Result: Poisoned outputs can display higher visual quality than clean counterparts, and latent space poisoning can retain/enhance aesthetics while producing consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs.

Conclusion: The method exposes a blind spot in pixel-level defenses and raises concerns for image generation pipeline integrity, as carefully optimized perturbations can be visually inconspicuous yet effective.

Abstract: Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to
synthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing
tasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied,
attacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in
inputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study
introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation
network PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy
triggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is
evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through
perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to
a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided
editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display
higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the
assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional
pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion
pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot
in pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can
produce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining
visually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation
pipelines.

*Yu Ma,Guoliang Wei,Yue Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DWGS enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting for sparse-view novel view synthesis by integrating depth estimation, virtual view generation, and occlusion-aware reconstruction to address overfitting and geometric distortion issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies in sparse-view settings, limiting its effectiveness for novel view synthesis from limited input views.

Method: Proposes three key components: Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation with dense matching priors, Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis for additional training constraints, and Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction using depth-difference masks and learning-based inpainting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on LLFF, Blender, and DTU benchmarks with up to 21.13 dB PSNR and 0.189 LPIPS, while maintaining real-time inference.

Conclusion: DWGS successfully addresses the core challenges of sparse-view novel view synthesis by integrating structural cues, virtual constraints, and occlusion completion, significantly improving 3DGS performance in sparse-input scenarios.

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views remains a core challenge in 3D
reconstruction, typically suffering from overfitting, geometric distortion, and
incomplete scene recovery due to limited multi-view constraints. Although 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time, high-fidelity rendering, it
suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under
sparse-input settings. To address these issues, we propose DWGS, a novel
unified framework that enhances 3DGS for sparse-view synthesis by integrating
robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region
completion. Our approach introduces three principal contributions: a
Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that leverages dense matching priors with
reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints to enforce
multi-view consistency; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method
generates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric
constraints; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that utilizes
depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured
regions. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (LLFF, Blender, and DTU)
show that DWGS achieves a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR
and 0.189 LPIPS, while retaining real-time inference capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAM is a novel SFADA framework that integrates multimodal supervision from Vision-and-Language models with sparse human annotations through bidirectional distillation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent domain adaptation studies use ViL models but treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate sources without effective fusion, limiting their complementary benefits.

Method: DAM integrates multimodal supervision from ViL models with human annotations to form dual supervisory signals, initializes stable ViL-guided targets, and uses bidirectional distillation for mutual knowledge exchange during iterative adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments show DAM consistently outperforms existing methods and sets new state-of-the-art across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed DAM framework effectively fuses multimodal supervision from ViL models with human annotations through bidirectional distillation, demonstrating superior performance in source-free active domain adaptation.

Abstract: Source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) enhances knowledge transfer from
a source model to an unlabeled target domain using limited manual labels
selected via active learning. While recent domain adaptation studies have
introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or
feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate
sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual
Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that
integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human
annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable
ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster
mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and the dual supervisions
during iterative adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAM
consistently outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art
across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for automated assessment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis that simultaneously predicts vertebral endplate angles and coordinates, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without predefined curve assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual Cobb angle measurements for AIS suffer from significant observer variability, and existing automated methods use simplified spinal models that fail to address clinical complexity.

Method: Combines HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically informed constraints for feature extraction. Uses Singular Value Decomposition to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral morphology without predefined curve assumptions.

Result: Achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55° mean absolute error on 630 full-spine radiographs. Demonstrated exceptional generalization on out-of-distribution cases. Introduced Vertebral Wedging Index (VWI) that showed significant prognostic correlation with curve progression.

Conclusion: The framework provides robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and progression monitoring, with VWI showing superior prognostic value compared to traditional Cobb angles.

Abstract: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting
approximately 2.2% of boys and 4.8% of girls worldwide. The Cobb angle serves
as the gold standard for AIS severity assessment, yet traditional manual
measurements suffer from significant observer variability, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. Despite prior automation attempts, existing methods use
simplified spinal models and predetermined curve patterns that fail to address
clinical complexity. We present a novel deep learning framework for AIS
assessment that simultaneously predicts both superior and inferior endplate
angles with corresponding midpoint coordinates for each vertebra, preserving
the anatomical reality of vertebral wedging in progressive AIS. Our approach
combines an HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically
informed constraints for enhanced feature extraction. We employ Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral
morphology, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without
predefined curve assumptions. Using 630 full-spine anteroposterior radiographs
from patients aged 10-18 years with rigorous dual-rater annotation, our method
achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55{\deg} mean absolute error. The
framework demonstrates exceptional generalization capability on
out-of-distribution cases. Additionally, we introduce the Vertebral Wedging
Index (VWI), a novel metric quantifying vertebral deformation. Longitudinal
analysis revealed VWI's significant prognostic correlation with curve
progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation, providing
robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and
progression monitoring.

TL;DR: Attention Surgery is an efficient framework that linearizes or hybridizes attention in pretrained video diffusion models without costly retraining, reducing attention FLOPs by up to 40% while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based video diffusion models have quadratic self-attention costs that make long sequences and high resolutions computationally expensive, while prior linear attention methods fail to match softmax attention expressiveness without expensive retraining.

Method: Combines hybrid attention (mixing softmax and linear tokens) with lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline, plus cost-aware block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers.

Result: Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B VDM, achieves first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models, reducing attention cost by up to 40% in FLOPs while maintaining quality on VBench and VBench-2.0 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Attention Surgery enables efficient sub-quadratic attention in pretrained VDMs without full retraining, making high-quality video generation more computationally accessible.

Abstract: Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art
video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of
self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally
expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior
attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly
retraining. We introduce \textit{Attention Surgery}, an efficient framework for
\textit{linearizing} or \textit{hybridizing} attention in pretrained VDMs
without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models,
our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and
linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline
requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware
block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers.
Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery
achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models,
reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining
generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0
benchmarks.

TL;DR: SID is a goal-oriented language-guided navigation approach that uses self-improving demonstrations to enhance agent exploration capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation methods rely exclusively on shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training agents to navigate to goals without step-by-step instructions.

Method: SID learns an initial agent on shortest-path data, then iteratively uses this agent to generate novel exploration trajectories that provide stronger exploration strategies for training better agents in a self-improving cycle.

Result: SID significantly boosts exploration capabilities and generalization, achieving 50.9% success rate on SOON unseen validation splits (13.9% improvement over prior methods) and new SOTA on REVERIE and SOON tasks.

Conclusion: The iterative self-improving pipeline scales to new environments and transfers across language-guided navigation tasks, elevating performance in diverse goal-oriented navigation.

Abstract: Goal-oriented language-guided navigation requires robust exploration
capabilities for agents to navigate to specified goals in unknown environments
without step-by-step instructions. Existing methods tend to exclusively utilize
shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training
navigation agents. To address the above challenges, we present SID, a
goal-oriented language-guided navigation learning approach with Self-Improving
Demonstrations. Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path
data sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel
exploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with
stronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces
higher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show
that this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments,
and the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of
language-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse
goal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID
significantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of
navigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including
REVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation
splits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long videos have temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant information, making it challenging for AI systems to achieve both completeness and efficiency in understanding. Existing LLM-based approaches struggle with this balance.

Method: CogniGPT uses an interactive loop between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) that mimics human visual attention (divergent and focused) and Verification-Enhanced Reflection Agent (VERA) that verifies perceived clues to reduce hallucination and optimize perception strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME, NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets show CogniGPT's superiority in accuracy and efficiency. On EgoSchema, it surpasses training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.

Conclusion: The proposed CogniGPT framework effectively addresses long video understanding challenges by mimicking human progressive visual cognition through interactive perception-verification loops, achieving both efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: Long videos, characterized by temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant
information, pose significant reasoning challenges for AI systems. Although
various Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have advanced long video
understanding, they still struggle to achieve both completeness and efficiency
in capturing task-critical information. Inspired by human progressive visual
cognition, we propose CogniGPT, a framework that leverages an interactive loop
between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced
Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient and reliable long video understanding.
Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to
capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to
mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through
this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and
reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME,
NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both
accuracy and efficiency. Notably, on EgoSchema, it surpasses existing
training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance
comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.

TL;DR: Temperature Scaling significantly improves calibration of CNN-based brain tumor classifiers under various noise conditions without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable confidence estimation in medical AI systems to prevent overconfident misclassifications that could have serious consequences in clinical settings.

Method: Developed custom CNN trained on merged brain MRI dataset, introduced five types of image noise (Gaussian, Poisson, Salt & Pepper, Speckle, Uniform), applied Temperature Scaling as post-hoc calibration technique.

Result: Temperature Scaling significantly reduced Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) under all noise conditions while maintaining classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Temperature Scaling is an effective and computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI systems in noisy or uncertain environments.

Abstract: Precise confidence estimation in deep learning is vital for high-stakes
fields like medical imaging, where overconfident misclassifications can have
serious consequences. This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature
Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop
a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world
uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt
& Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision,
recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected
calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate
that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without
degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and
computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI
systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Scene Graph approaches largely ignore humans and lack annotated human-environment relationships, limiting robots' ability to understand social interactions and act in socially compliant ways.

Method: Introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs that capture humans, attributes, activities, and both local and remote relationships in the environment using open-vocabulary framework. Create a new benchmark with synthetic environments and comprehensive human-scene relationship annotations.

Result: The proposed representation improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment relations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Social 3D Scene Graphs pave the way toward socially intelligent robots by enabling better understanding of human interactions and relationships in 3D environments.

Abstract: Understanding how people interact with their surroundings and each other is
essential for enabling robots to act in socially compliant and context-aware
ways. While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation
for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the
scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships.
Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations
from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range
interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs,
an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their
attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and
remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new
benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene
relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social
scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation
improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment
relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.

TL;DR: A novel framework using cross-modal fusion attention and self-supervised multi-event representation learning for event-based facial keypoint alignment, addressing limitations of event data through RGB guidance and unlabeled data utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer advantages for facial keypoint alignment in challenging conditions, but existing RGB methods don't work well on event data, and training solely on event data leads to suboptimal performance due to limited spatial information and lack of comprehensive labeled datasets.

Method: Proposes CMFA (cross-modal fusion attention) to integrate RGB data for guiding robust facial feature extraction from event inputs, and SSMER (self-supervised multi-event representation learning) for effective feature learning from unlabeled event data to overcome spatial limitations.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-event E-SIE dataset and synthetic-event WFLW-V benchmark show the approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges of event-based facial keypoint alignment by leveraging cross-modal guidance and self-supervised learning, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for facial keypoint alignment under
challenging conditions, such as low light and rapid motion, due to their high
temporal resolution and robustness to varying illumination. However, existing
RGB facial keypoint alignment methods do not perform well on event data, and
training solely on event data often leads to suboptimal performance because of
its limited spatial information. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive labeled
event datasets further hinders progress in this area. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework based on cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and
self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for event-based
facial keypoint alignment. Our framework employs CMFA to integrate
corresponding RGB data, guiding the model to extract robust facial features
from event input images. In parallel, SSMER enables effective feature learning
from unlabeled event data, overcoming spatial limitations. Extensive
experiments on our real-event E-SIE dataset and a synthetic-event version of
the public WFLW-V benchmark show that our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

Motivation: Need for robust glioma segmentation across pre- and post-treatment scans for consistent tumor monitoring, but limited by scarce annotated data and computational costs of storing augmented 3D data.

Method: Three nnU-Net-based models with different augmentation strategies: baseline (no external augmentation), regular on-the-fly augmentation, and customized on-the-fly augmentation using pretrained GliGANs to dynamically insert synthetic tumors during training.

Result: Ensemble achieved lesion-wise Dice scores: 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH), 0.79 (TC), 0.88 (WT) on BraTS 2025 validation platform, ranking first in BraTS Lighthouse Challenge 2025 Task 1.

Conclusion: On-the-fly augmentation with pretrained generative models effectively addresses data scarcity and computational constraints for robust glioma segmentation across treatment timelines.

Abstract: Robust segmentation across both pre-treatment and post-treatment glioma scans
can be helpful for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning. BraTS
2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying
tumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such
generalized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data,
which is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing
large volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address
these challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that
dynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial
networks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and
their ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular
on-the-fly augmented model, and (3) a model with customized on-the-fly
augmentation. Built upon the nnU-Net framework, our pipeline leverages
pretrained GliGAN weights and tumor insertion methods from prior
challenge-winning solutions. An ensemble of the three models achieves
lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH),
0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on the online BraTS 2025 validation platform. This

Conclusion: Wan-Alpha demonstrates significant improvements in RGBA video generation quality and is available for public use.

Abstract: RGBA video generation, which includes an alpha channel to represent
transparency, is gaining increasing attention across a wide range of
applications. However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting
their practical usability. In this paper, we propose \textit{Wan-Alpha}, a new

encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the
training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit the rich multi-scale latent features of pre-trained diffusion models for structured outputs like human pose estimation, which remains underexplored compared to dense prediction tasks.

Method: Directly predicts keypoint heatmaps in SD U-Net's latent space, uses lightweight convolutional pose head, and incorporates auxiliary RGB reconstruction branch to prevent overfitting and enhance robustness.

Result: Achieves parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on COCO with only 1/5 training time, sets new SOTA on cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD, and serves as effective zero-shot pose annotator for controllable generation tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are
emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as
Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt
diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization,
their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning
framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion
priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention
modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint
heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original
generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps
through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the
pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance
out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction
branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate
robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a
style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just
one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains
parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new
state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD.
Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream
controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and
video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.

*Yuyang Yin,HaoXiang Guo,Fangfu Liu,Mengyu Wang,Hanwen Liang,Eric Li,Yikai Wang,Xiaojie Jin,Yao Zhao,Yunchao Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoWorld-X is a framework for high-fidelity, controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories, addressing limitations of narrow field-of-view and insufficient camera controllability in prior works.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable complete and explorable 360-degree visual worlds for downstream applications, overcoming constraints of narrow field-of-view limitations and insufficient camera controllability in existing methods.

Method: Constructs large-scale panoramic video-exploration route pairs using Unreal Engine simulations, and introduces Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer that reprojects equirectangular features onto spherical surface to model geometric adjacency in latent space.

Result: Achieves superior performance in motion range, control precision, and visual quality compared to prior methods, demonstrating enhanced visual fidelity and spatiotemporal continuity.

Conclusion: PanoWorld-X shows strong potential for real-world applications in panoramic video generation with improved controllability and visual quality.

Abstract: Generating a complete and explorable 360-degree visual world enables a wide
range of downstream applications. While prior works have advanced the field,
they remain constrained by either narrow field-of-view limitations, which
hinder the synthesis of continuous and holistic scenes, or insufficient camera
controllability that restricts free exploration by users or autonomous agents.
To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity
and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories.
Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic
video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D
environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data
misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then
introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects
equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric
adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and
spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion
range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for
real-world applications.

*Tooba Imtiaz,Lucy Chai,Kathryn Heal,Xuan Luo,Jungyeon Park,Jennifer Dy,John Flynn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVT is a transformer-based architecture for large-scale 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis that avoids quadratic attention complexity by processing only local view neighborhoods with geometric-aware positional encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard transformers have quadratic complexity that prevents scaling to large scenes, while spatially nearby views provide more useful local scene information than distant views.

Method: Processes information in local neighborhoods around each view using geometric-aware positional encoding based on relative transformations between query and nearby views, then decodes into 3D Gaussian Splat representation with view-dependent color and opacity.

Result: Enables reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward pass.

Conclusion: LVT successfully addresses the scalability limitations of standard transformers for 3D vision tasks while maintaining high-quality scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis capabilities.

Abstract: Large transformer models are proving to be a powerful tool for 3D vision and
novel view synthesis. However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic
complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a
large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that
circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the
insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local
scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a
local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we
leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric
transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our
model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color
and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables
reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward
pass. See our project page for results and interactive demos

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning has shown strong reasoning capabilities in natural image domains but remains largely unexplored for Earth Observation tasks, which present unique challenges requiring task-aware reasoning.

Method: Proposed a post-training framework that incorporates task-aware rewards to adapt reasoning-based RL models to diverse EO tasks, enhancing reasoning capabilities and stabilizing optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple EO benchmarks show consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art generic and specialized vision language models.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables effective adaptation of RL models to Earth Observation tasks, improving robustness and reasoning capabilities for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have delivered strong
reasoning capabilities in natural image domains, yet their potential for Earth
Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. EO tasks introduce unique
challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning,
change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis, that demand task aware

aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning based RL models to
diverse EO tasks. This training strategy enhances reasoning capabilities for
remote sensing images, stabilizes optimization, and improves robustness.

### [337] [STAGE: Stable and Generalizable GRPO for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25027)
*Xiaoxiao Ma,Haibo Qiu,Guohui Zhang,Zhixiong Zeng,Siqi Yang,Lin Ma,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAGE is a stable reinforcement learning framework for autoregressive image generation that addresses gradient conflicts and entropy instability in GRPO methods through advantage/KL reweighting and entropy rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO algorithms struggle with autoregressive image models due to training instability that disrupts pretrained capabilities, leading to marginal gains, degraded quality, and poor generalization.

Method: STAGE introduces two solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting with similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting gradient updates, and 2) Entropy reward based on reference model to stabilize learning dynamics.

Result: Experiments show STAGE consistently improves visual quality, training stability, and cross-task generalization compared to baseline GRPO across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: STAGE effectively reduces disruption of pretrained distributions and mitigates reward hacking, leading to better generalization and transfer to other benchmarks in autoregressive image generation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently been explored to improve text-to-image
generation, yet applying existing GRPO algorithms to autoregressive (AR) image
models remains challenging. The instability of the training process easily
disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in
marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work,
we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues:
contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy
dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable
framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting.
Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy
reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize
learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy
reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained
distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization
and transfer better to other benchmarks. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task
generalization compared to baseline GRPO.

### [338] [VT-FSL: Bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25033)
*Wenhao Li,Qiangchang Wang,Xianjing Meng,Zhibin Wu,Yilong Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-FSL is a novel few-shot learning framework that bridges vision and text using LLMs, featuring cross-modal iterative prompting and geometric alignment to generate precise class descriptions and synthetic images for improved few-shot classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot learning methods suffer from hallucinating semantics that contradict visual evidence due to lack of grounding in actual instances, leading to noisy guidance and costly corrections.

Method: Proposes Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) that conditions LLMs on class names and support images to generate precise class descriptions, and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA) that jointly aligns textual, support, and synthetic visual representations by minimizing kernelized volume.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: VT-FSL effectively bridges vision and text through LLM-based prompting and geometric alignment, providing complementary textual and visual prompts to compensate for limited support data in few-shot learning.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few
labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by
incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic
fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that
contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual
instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these
issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for
Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts
conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly
integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of
Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment
(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support
images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single
structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic
understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of
semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act
respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level
class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited
support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,
and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the
3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear
relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent
multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new
state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard,
cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FFDP is a distributed framework with IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels for large-scale image registration, enabling processing of problems 570x larger than clinical standards using 8 GPUs in about a minute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image registration algorithms have not scaled with image acquisition capabilities, creating a bottleneck in biomedical and life sciences where large-scale image processing is needed.

Method: Proposes FFDP framework with IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels, distributed processing, convolution-aware tensor sharding, and optimization of non-GEMM bottlenecks to complement existing model parallelism techniques.

Result: Achieved registration of 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI at native resolution (570x larger than clinical standard) in ~1 minute using 8 A6000 GPUs. Accelerated existing pipelines by 6-7x while reducing peak memory by 20-59%. Fit 64x larger problems than SOTA on single GPU.

Conclusion: FFDP enables unprecedented scale in image registration with significant performance and efficiency gains, making large-scale biomedical image processing feasible.

Abstract: In this work, we propose FFDP, a set of IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels
supplemented with a distributed framework for image registration at
unprecedented scales. Image registration is an inverse problem fundamental to
biomedical and life sciences, but algorithms have not scaled in tandem with
image acquisition capabilities. Our framework complements existing model
parallelism techniques proposed for large-scale transformer training by
optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks and enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding.
We demonstrate unprecedented capabilities by performing multimodal registration
of a 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI volume at native resolution - an
inverse problem more than 570x larger than a standard clinical datum in about a
minute using only 8 A6000 GPUs. FFDP accelerates existing state-of-the-art
optimization and deep learning registration pipelines by upto 6 - 7x while
reducing peak memory consumption by 20 - 59%. Comparative analysis on a 250
micron dataset shows that FFDP can fit upto 64x larger problems than existing
SOTA on a single GPU, and highlights both the performance and efficiency gains
of FFDP compared to SOTA image registration methods.

*Huaizhi Qu,Xiao Wang,Gengwei Zhang,Jie Peng,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEM is a novel cryo-EM reconstruction framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting that achieves faster training, lower memory usage, and improved resolution compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Fourier-space methods lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space NeRF approaches have cubic memory and computation overhead, making cryo-EM reconstruction computationally expensive and memory intensive.

Method: GEM represents proteins with compact 3D Gaussians (11 parameters each) and uses a novel gradient computation method to reduce memory footprint and training cost.

Result: GEM achieves up to 48% faster training, 12% lower memory usage, and improves local resolution by up to 38.8% compared to state-of-the-art methods on standard cryo-EM benchmarks.

Conclusion: GEM establishes a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction that unifies speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for
high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often
exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally
expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient
but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space
approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur
cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel
cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that
operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of
modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D
Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the
training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians
that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory
footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to
48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results
establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction,
unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy. Our code is available

*Xiaoyi Huang,Junwei Wu,Kejia Zhang,Carl Yang,Zhiming Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MANI-Pure is a novel adversarial purification framework that uses frequency-targeted noise injection instead of uniform noise, achieving state-of-the-art robust accuracy while maintaining clean accuracy close to the original classifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial purification methods use uniform noise injection that corrupts semantic structures. The authors discovered adversarial perturbations are concentrated in high-frequency regions with heterogeneous patterns, motivating a frequency-adaptive approach.

Method: MANI-Pure leverages magnitude spectrum analysis to guide purification. It adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise to suppress adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude bands while preserving low-frequency semantic content.

Result: On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K, MANI-Pure narrows clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of original classifier, boosts robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves top-1 robust accuracy on RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing previous state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Frequency-adaptive noise injection based on magnitude spectrum analysis is an effective strategy for adversarial purification, significantly improving robustness while preserving clean accuracy.

Abstract: Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising
defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise
injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic
structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that
adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly
concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity
patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this
observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification
framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the
purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure
adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively
suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude
bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of
MANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original
classifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1
robust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Triangle Splatting+ directly optimizes triangles within a differentiable splatting framework, enabling real-time mesh-based novel view synthesis without post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods are incompatible with mesh-based pipelines used in VR and graphics applications, requiring complex post-processing that degrades quality.

Method: Direct optimization of triangle primitives with shared vertex connectivity and opaque triangle enforcement in a differentiable splatting framework.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples datasets, surpassing prior splatting approaches in visual fidelity while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The method produces semi-connected meshes ready for use in standard graphics engines, supporting downstream applications like physics simulation and interactive walkthroughs.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress
in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric
radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long
training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians,
enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian
primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR
headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to
convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines,
which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we
introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the
fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting
framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through
shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque
triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines
without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples
datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in
mesh-based novel view synthesis. Our method surpasses prior splatting
approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to training.
Moreover, the resulting semi-connected meshes support downstream applications
such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs. The project page

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAnchor is a plug-and-play module that improves visual-spatial reasoning in MLLMs by leveraging subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs have limitations in visual-spatial reasoning because visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens in attention mechanisms, preventing consistent recognition of visual cues across frames.

Method: Proposes VideoAnchor module that draws connection between self-expressiveness property in sparse subspace clustering and attention mechanism in Transformers, using subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames.

Result: Achieves 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B backbones, with qualitative analyses showing more coherent subspace partitions and stronger visual grounding.

Conclusion: VideoAnchor effectively anchors attention to shared visual structures across frames, providing consistent performance gains for visual-spatial reasoning in MLLMs without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in
vision-language alignment, yet they remain limited in visual-spatial reasoning.
We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism:
visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from
consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this
challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property
in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers.
Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that
leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without
retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent
performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and
Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while
qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger
visual grounding. Our codes will be made public available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rolling Forcing is a novel video generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error accumulation through joint denoising, attention sink mechanism, and efficient training algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing streaming video generation methods suffer from severe error accumulation that degrades video quality over long horizons, limiting their practical application in interactive world models and neural game engines.

Method: Three key designs: 1) Joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames with progressive noise levels to suppress error growth; 2) Attention sink mechanism that maintains key value states of initial frames as global context anchor; 3) Efficient training algorithm for few-step distillation over extended denoising windows.

Result: Enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU with substantially reduced error accumulation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Rolling Forcing effectively addresses the error accumulation problem in long-horizon video generation and enables high-quality, low-latency streaming video generation for practical applications.

Abstract: Streaming video generation, as one fundamental component in interactive world
models and neural game engines, aims to generate high-quality, low-latency, and
temporally coherent long video streams. However, most existing work suffers
from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated
stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video
generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error
accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of
iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we
design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames
with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict
causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second,
we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video
generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial
frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global
consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables
few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm
operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on
self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing
enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU,
with substantially reduced error accumulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Aligning pretrained visual encoders as tokenizers for latent diffusion models using a three-stage alignment strategy to create semantically rich image tokenizers that accelerate diffusion model convergence and improve generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the rich semantic structure of foundation visual encoders rather than training VAEs from scratch, which primarily focus on low-level details, to create better tokenizers for diffusion models.

Method: Three-stage alignment: (1) freeze encoder and train adapter/decoder for semantic latent space, (2) joint optimization with semantic preservation loss, (3) decoder refinement for reconstruction quality.

Result: Achieved gFID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256×256 within 64 epochs, accelerated diffusion model convergence, improved generation with/without classifier-free guidance, and outperformed FLUX VAE in 2B-parameter text-to-image model on LAION.

Conclusion: The method provides a simple, scalable approach for creating semantically grounded continuous tokenizers that significantly benefit diffusion models in image generation.

Abstract: In this work, we propose aligning pretrained visual encoders to serve as
tokenizers for latent diffusion models in image generation. Unlike training a
variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes
low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of
foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze
the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent
space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic
preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while
retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved
reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image
tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our
tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of
1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without
classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model
trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same
training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a
semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PICO is a visual in-context learning framework that uses diffusion transformers to perform personalized vision tasks from a single annotated example, without requiring fine-tuning or synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision models struggle with personalized tasks defined by users at test time, and current personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or inflexible synthetic data pipelines.

Method: A four-panel framework that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual in-context learners, using a diverse tuning dataset (VisRel) and attention-guided seed scorer for improved reliability.

Result: PICO surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, flexibly adapts to novel user-defined tasks, and generalizes across both recognition and generation tasks.

Conclusion: Task diversity rather than dataset scale drives robust generalization in visual in-context learning, enabling effective personalized vision without retraining.

Abstract: Modern vision models, trained on large-scale annotated datasets, excel at
predefined tasks but struggle with personalized vision -- tasks defined at test
time by users with customized objects or novel objectives. Existing
personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data
pipelines, which are inflexible and restricted to fixed task formats. Visual
in-context learning (ICL) offers a promising alternative, yet prior methods
confine to narrow, in-domain tasks and fail to generalize to open-ended
personalization. We introduce Personalized In-Context Operator (PICO), a simple
four-panel framework that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual
in-context learners. Given a single annotated exemplar, PICO infers the
underlying transformation and applies it to new inputs without retraining. To
enable this, we construct VisRel, a compact yet diverse tuning dataset, showing
that task diversity, rather than scale, drives robust generalization. We
further propose an attention-guided seed scorer that improves reliability via
efficient inference scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICO (i)
surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, (ii) flexibly adapts to
novel user-defined tasks, and (iii) generalizes across both recognition and
generation.

### [348] [Mitigating Hallucination in Multimodal LLMs with Layer Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25177)
*Bingkui Tong,Jiaer Xia,Kaiyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerCD is a simple method that reduces hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models by contrasting output distributions from shallow vs deep visual features, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from hallucinations - generating outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with input images, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations.

Method: Layer Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD) contrasts output distributions generated from shallow vs deep visual features of the vision encoder, filtering out hallucinations since shallow features capture biased low-level information insufficient for high-level reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments on two hallucination benchmarks show LayerCD significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LayerCD effectively reduces hallucinations in MLLMs by leveraging the observation that shallow visual features are more likely to cause hallucinations than deep visual features.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive perception and
reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from hallucinations -- generating
outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with the context of
the input image, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple approach called Layer
Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD). Our design is motivated by the observation that
shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause
an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that
is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out
hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual
features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep
layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on
two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art. The code for LayerCD is available at

*Ting-Hsuan Liao,Haowen Liu,Yiran Xu,Songwei Ge,Gengshan Yang,Jia-Bin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAD3R reconstructs deformable 3D objects from unposed monocular videos using personalized pose estimation guided by pre-trained 3D models and regularized by long-term 2D tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with long video sequences containing substantial object deformation, large camera movement, and limited view coverage that challenge conventional reconstruction systems.

Method: Trains personalized object-centric pose estimator supervised by pre-trained image-to-3D model, guides optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation, and regularizes with long-term 2D point tracking across entire video.

Result: Reconstructs high-fidelity articulated 3D representations in category-agnostic way, showing robustness and good generalization across challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: PAD3R demonstrates potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D content creation by effectively combining generative priors with differentiable rendering.

Abstract: We present PAD3R, a method for reconstructing deformable 3D objects from
casually captured, unposed monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches, PAD3R
handles long video sequences featuring substantial object deformation,
large-scale camera movement, and limited view coverage that typically challenge
conventional systems. At its core, our approach trains a personalized,
object-centric pose estimator, supervised by a pre-trained image-to-3D model.
This guides the optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation. The
optimization is further regularized by long-term 2D point tracking over the
entire input video. By combining generative priors and differentiable
rendering, PAD3R reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations of
objects in a category-agnostic way. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
results show that PAD3R is robust and generalizes well across challenging
scenarios, highlighting its potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D
content creation.

### [350] [PixelCraft: A Multi-Agent System for High-Fidelity Visual Reasoning on Structured Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25185)
*Shuoshuo Zhang,Zijian Li,Yizhen Zhang,Jingjing Fu,Lei Song,Jiang Bian,Jun Zhang,Yujiu Yang,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelCraft is a multi-agent system that improves visual reasoning on structured images (charts, diagrams) by combining high-fidelity image processing with flexible reasoning through tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for structured image analysis suffer from low-fidelity image processing and rigid reasoning patterns, leading to perceptual errors that cascade into incorrect conclusions.

Method: A multi-agent system with dispatcher, planner, reasoner, critics, and visual tool agents. Uses fine-tuned MLLM for pixel-level localization integrated with CV algorithms, plus dynamic three-stage workflow with tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.

Result: Significantly improves visual reasoning performance on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks, setting new standards for structured image reasoning.

Conclusion: PixelCraft effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by enabling high-fidelity processing and flexible reasoning through its multi-agent architecture and dynamic workflow.

Abstract: Structured images (e.g., charts and geometric diagrams) remain challenging
for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as perceptual slips can cascade
into erroneous conclusions. Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning;
however, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image
processing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness
on complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a
novel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual
reasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a
reasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity
processing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a
grounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with
traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. Building on this
foundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic
three-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.
Moreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical
images, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively
revisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and
dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion. Extensive
experiments on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks demonstrate that
PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning performance for advanced
MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/microsoft/PixelCraft.

### [351] [FlashI2V: Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting Prevents Conditional Image Leakage in Image-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25187)
*Yunyang Ge,Xinhua Cheng,Chengshu Zhao,Xianyi He,Shenghai Yuan,Bin Lin,Bin Zhu,Li Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashI2V addresses conditional image leakage in Image-to-Video generation by using latent shifting and Fourier guidance, achieving better generalization and outperforming larger models on out-of-domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing I2V methods suffer from conditional image leakage where denoisers shortcut the conditional image, causing slow motion, color inconsistency, and poor performance on out-of-domain data.

Method: FlashI2V uses two main components: (1) Latent Shifting - modifies flow matching distributions by subtracting conditional image information from noisy latents, (2) Fourier Guidance - uses high-frequency magnitude features from Fourier Transform to accelerate convergence and adjust detail levels.

Result: FlashI2V achieves dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V with only 1.3B parameters, outperforming larger models like CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P.

Conclusion: The method effectively overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms.

Abstract: In Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, a video is created using an input image
as the first-frame condition. Existing I2V methods concatenate the full
information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high
fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the
conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to
performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In
this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to
overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain
scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named
FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists
of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow
matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy
latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance.
We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to
accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the
generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively
overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and
performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B
parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V,
surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P. Github page:

### [352] [Visual Jigsaw Post-Training Improves MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25190)
*Penghao Wu,Yushan Zhang,Haiwen Diao,Bo Li,Lewei Lu,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual Jigsaw is a self-supervised post-training framework that enhances MLLMs' visual understanding through a visual ordering task where models reconstruct shuffled visual information by predicting correct permutations in natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM post-training is predominantly text-centric, using visual inputs only for sparse text-based reasoning cues. There's a need for vision-centric approaches that don't rely on text mediators or additional visual generative components.

Method: Visual Jigsaw partitions visual inputs (images, videos, 3D data), shuffles them, and requires models to reconstruct the correct permutation in natural language. It uses reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards without annotations or additional components.

Result: Extensive experiments show substantial improvements in fine-grained perception, temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding across three visual modalities.

Conclusion: Self-supervised vision-centric tasks like Visual Jigsaw have strong potential for enhancing MLLMs' visual understanding and should inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training has recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing the alignment and reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). While vision-centric post-training is crucial
for enhancing MLLMs' intrinsic understanding of visual signals, current
post-training paradigms are predominantly text-centric, where dense visual
inputs are only leveraged to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning.
There exist a few approaches in this direction, however, they often still rely
on text as an intermediate mediator or introduce additional visual generative
designs. In this work, we introduce Visual Jigsaw, a generic self-supervised
post-training framework designed to strengthen visual understanding in MLLMs.
Visual Jigsaw is formulated as a general ordering task: visual inputs are
partitioned, shuffled, and the model must reconstruct the visual information by
producing the correct permutation in natural language. This naturally aligns
with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), requires no
additional visual generative components, and derives its supervisory signal
automatically without any annotations. We instantiate Visual Jigsaw across
three visual modalities, including images, videos, and 3D data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in fine-grained perception,
temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding. Our findings highlight the
potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks in post-training MLLMs and
aim to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGGT-X addresses VRAM limitations and imperfect outputs when scaling 3D Foundation Models to dense novel view synthesis, achieving state-of-the-art COLMAP-free results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NVS approaches rely on slow and fragile SfM pipelines for 3D attributes. 3DFMs offer speed but face barriers in dense-view settings.

Method: Memory-efficient VGGT implementation scaling to 1000+ images, adaptive global alignment for output enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices.

Result: Substantially closes fidelity gap with COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving SOTA in dense COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation.

Conclusion: VGGT-X provides insights for future 3D foundation model development while demonstrating competitive performance without traditional SfM pipelines.

Abstract: We study the problem of applying 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs) to dense Novel
View Synthesis (NVS). Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis
powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D
attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or
low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over
the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the
validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study
reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental
barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that
degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we
introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that
scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output
enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show
that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with
COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense
COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of
remaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the
future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS. Our project page is

*Alessandra Urbinati,Mirko Lai,Simona Frenda,Marco Antonio Stranisci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents an unsupervised approach using conformal prediction to measure bias in language models for content moderation by analyzing uncertainty in classifying messages from vulnerable groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language model-based classifiers for content moderation perpetuate racial and social biases, and existing benchmarks don't adequately measure model fairness, especially for vulnerable groups.

Method: Used conformal prediction technique to compute uncertainty as a proxy for bias analysis. Evaluated 11 models against women and non-white annotators, comparing uncertainty metrics with traditional performance metrics like F1 score.

Result: Some pre-trained models achieved high accuracy on minority group labels but with low confidence in predictions. Uncertainty measurements revealed which annotator groups are better represented in models.

Conclusion: Measuring model confidence through uncertainty analysis helps identify underrepresented groups and guides debiasing processes before model deployment in content moderation systems.

Abstract: Automatic content moderation is crucial to ensuring safety in social media.
Language Model-based classifiers are being increasingly adopted for this task,
but it has been shown that they perpetuate racial and social biases. Even if
several resources and benchmark corpora have been developed to challenge this
issue, measuring the fairness of models in content moderation remains an open
issue. In this work, we present an unsupervised approach that benchmarks models
on the basis of their uncertainty in classifying messages annotated by people
belonging to vulnerable groups. We use uncertainty, computed by means of the
conformal prediction technique, as a proxy to analyze the bias of 11 models
against women and non-white annotators and observe to what extent it diverges
from metrics based on performance, such as the $F_1$ score. The results show
that some pre-trained models predict with high accuracy the labels coming from
minority groups, even if the confidence in their prediction is low. Therefore,
by measuring the confidence of models, we are able to see which groups of
annotators are better represented in pre-trained models and lead the debiasing
process of these models before their effective use.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AccessEval is a benchmark that evaluates 21 LLMs across 6 domains and 9 disability types, revealing that disability-aware queries receive more negative, stereotyped, and factually inaccurate responses compared to neutral queries, with hearing, speech, and mobility disabilities being disproportionately affected.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate disparities in how LLMs handle real-life queries across various disability contexts and understand how biases can translate into tangible harms for disabled users.

Method: Introduced AccessEval benchmark evaluating 21 closed- and open-source LLMs across 6 real-world domains and 9 disability types using paired Neutral and Disability-Aware Queries, with metrics for sentiment, social perception, and factual accuracy.

Result: Responses to disability-aware queries have more negative tone, increased stereotyping, and higher factual errors compared to neutral queries. These effects vary by domain and disability type, with hearing, speech, and mobility disabilities disproportionately impacted, reflecting embedded ableism in model behavior.

Conclusion: The study illuminates how biases in LLMs can translate into tangible harms for disabled users, bridging the gap between technical evaluation and user impact, and reinforcing the importance of bias mitigation in day-to-day applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse domains
but often exhibit disparities in how they handle real-life queries. To
systematically investigate these effects within various disability contexts, we
introduce \textbf{AccessEval (Accessibility Evaluation)}, a benchmark
evaluating 21 closed- and open-source LLMs across 6 real-world domains and 9
disability types using paired Neutral and Disability-Aware Queries. We
evaluated model outputs with metrics for sentiment, social perception, and
factual accuracy.
  Our analysis reveals that responses to disability-aware queries tend to have
a more negative tone, increased stereotyping, and higher factual error compared
to neutral queries. These effects show notable variation by domain and
disability type, with disabilities affecting hearing, speech, and mobility
disproportionately impacted. These disparities reflect persistent forms of
ableism embedded in model behavior.
  By examining model performance in real-world decision-making contexts, we
better illuminate how such biases can translate into tangible harms for
disabled users. This framing helps bridges the gap between technical evaluation
and user impact, reinforcing importance of bias mitigation in day-to-day
applications. Our dataset is publicly available at:

TL;DR: RAR² is a joint learning framework that improves both reasoning-augmented retrieval and retrieval-augmented reasoning for medical question answering, addressing limitations of standard RAG in handling complex medical questions requiring intensive reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG struggles with complex medical questions that require intensive reasoning, as surface-level input often fails to reflect true knowledge needs. Existing methods focus on refining queries without explicitly modeling the reasoning process.

Method: RAR² constructs a thought process to uncover implicit knowledge requirements and uses it to guide retrieval and answer generation. It builds a training dataset of mixed preference pairs and applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), with two test-time scaling strategies.

Result: Experiments show RAR² outperforms RAG baselines with or without fine-tuning across several biomedical question answering datasets.

Conclusion: RAR² effectively addresses the limitations of standard RAG in medical QA by jointly improving reasoning-augmented retrieval and retrieval-augmented reasoning through explicit modeling of the reasoning process.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on diverse
medical benchmarks, highlighting their potential in supporting real-world
clinical tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a key
approach for mitigating knowledge gaps and hallucinations by incorporating
external medical information. However, RAG still struggles with complex medical
questions that require intensive reasoning, as surface-level input often fails
to reflect the true knowledge needs of the task. Existing methods typically
focus on refining queries without explicitly modeling the reasoning process,
limiting their ability to retrieve and integrate clinically relevant knowledge.
In this work, we propose RAR$^2$, a joint learning framework that improves both
Reasoning-Augmented Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning. RAR$^2$
constructs a thought process to uncover implicit knowledge requirements and
uses it to guide retrieval and answer generation. We build a training dataset
of mixed preference pairs and apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to
train the model. Moreover, we design two test-time scaling strategies to
explore the boundaries of our framework. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAR$^2$ across several biomedical question answering datasets,
outperforming RAG baselines with or without fine-tuning.

*Jiho Park,Jongyoon Song,Minjin Choi,Kyuho Heo,Taehun Huh,Ji Won Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRUEBench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM-based productivity assistants that addresses limitations of existing benchmarks by incorporating multilingual prompts, implicit constraints, and multi-turn dialogues with rigorous evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to adequately evaluate LLMs' real-world instruction-following capabilities due to insufficient multilinguality, inability to capture implicit constraints, and overlooking multi-turn dialogue complexities.

Method: Developed TRUEBench with prompts across 12 languages, intra-instance multilingual instructions, rigorous evaluation criteria for explicit/implicit constraints, complex multi-turn dialogues with accumulating constraints and context switches, and LLM-based constraint validation.

Result: TRUEBench presents significantly greater challenges than existing benchmarks - even strong models like OpenAI o1 achieved only 69.07% overall pass rate, demonstrating the benchmark's demanding nature.

Conclusion: TRUEBench provides a realistic and challenging assessment of LLMs in practical productivity settings, effectively highlighting both their capabilities and limitations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integral as productivity
assistants, but existing benchmarks fall short in rigorously evaluating their
real-world instruction-following capabilities. Current benchmarks often (i)
lack sufficient multilinguality, (ii) fail to capture the implicit constraints
inherent in user requests, and (iii) overlook the complexities of multi-turn
dialogue. To address these critical gaps and provide a more realistic
assessment, we introduce TRUEBench (Trustworthy Real-world Usage Evaluation
Benchmark)1, a novel benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based productivity
assistants. TRUEBench distinguishes itself by featuring input prompts across 12
languages, incorporating intra-instance multilingual instructions, employing
rigorous evaluation criteria to capture both explicit and implicit constraints,
and including complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios with both accumulating
constraints and context switches. Furthermore, to ensure reliability in
evaluation, we refined constraints using an LLM validator. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TRUEBench presents significantly greater
challenges than existing benchmarks; for instance, a strong model like OpenAI
o1 achieved only a 69.07% overall pass rate. TRUEBench offers a demanding and
realistic assessment of LLMs in practical productivity settings, highlighting
their capabilities and limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DAF is a lightweight multimodal framework that combines text and acoustic features using dynamic attention, outperforming unimodal and static fusion methods without finetuning encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sentiment analysis relies only on text, missing important non-verbal cues like vocal tone and prosody that are essential for capturing true emotional intent.

Method: Dynamic Attention Fusion (DAF) combines frozen text embeddings from a pretrained language model with acoustic features from a speech encoder, using an adaptive attention mechanism to weight each modality per utterance.

Result: DAF consistently outperforms both static fusion and unimodal baselines on a large multimodal benchmark, with notable gains in F1-score and reductions in prediction error.

Conclusion: The dynamic weighting strategy is crucial for modeling emotionally complex inputs, offering a more robust foundation for sentiment prediction and broader affective computing applications.

Abstract: Traditional sentiment analysis has long been a unimodal task, relying solely
on text. This approach overlooks non-verbal cues such as vocal tone and prosody
that are essential for capturing true emotional intent. We introduce Dynamic
Attention Fusion (DAF), a lightweight framework that combines frozen text
embeddings from a pretrained language model with acoustic features from a
speech encoder, using an adaptive attention mechanism to weight each modality
per utterance. Without any finetuning of the underlying encoders, our proposed
DAF model consistently outperforms both static fusion and unimodal baselines on
a large multimodal benchmark. We report notable gains in F1-score and
reductions in prediction error and perform a variety of ablation studies that
support our hypothesis that the dynamic weighting strategy is crucial for
modeling emotionally complex inputs. By effectively integrating verbal and
non-verbal information, our approach offers a more robust foundation for
sentiment prediction and carries broader impact for affective computing
applications -- from emotion recognition and mental health assessment to more
natural human computer interaction.

### [359] [Enabling Approximate Joint Sampling in Diffusion LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22738)
*Parikshit Bansal,Sujay Sanghavi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for approximate joint sampling in masked diffusion language models that allows unmasking multiple tokens per full-model forward pass while maintaining distribution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models sample tokens sequentially from the correct joint distribution, while diffusion models unmask tokens out of order, causing deviation from the true joint when unmasking multiple tokens in parallel. This creates a trade-off between speed (more parallel tokens) and accuracy (closer to true joint).

Method: Developed a lightweight single-layer 'sampler' on top of existing large diffusion LMs. One full-model forward pass is followed by multiple forward passes of only this sampler layer to yield multiple unmasked tokens. The sampler is trained to mimic exact joint sampling from the frozen full model.

Result: When unmasking four tokens per denoising step, achieves MAUVE score of 0.87 (vs marginal baseline of 0.31) with respect to true joint distribution. Effective for both pretrained-only (Dream-7B-Base) and instruction-tuned (Dream-7B-Instruct) models on language modeling and math & coding tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approximate joint sampling method successfully bridges the speed-accuracy trade-off in diffusion language models, enabling faster generation while maintaining distribution quality close to the true joint.

Abstract: In autoregressive language models, each token is sampled by conditioning on
all the past tokens; the overall string has thus been sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution represented by the model. In contrast, masked
diffusion language models generate text by unmasking tokens out of order and
potentially in parallel. Generating an overall string sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution would (again) require exactly one token unmasking
in every full-model forward pass. The more tokens unmasked in parallel, the
further away the string is from the true joint; this can be seen in the
resulting drop in accuracy (but, increase in speed). In this paper we devise a
way to {\em approximately} sample multiple tokens from the joint distribution
in a single full-model forward pass; we do so by developing a new lightweight
single-layer ``sampler" on top of an existing large diffusion LM. One forward
pass of the full model can now be followed by multiple forward passes of only
this sampler layer, to yield multiple unmasked tokens. Our sampler is trained
to mimic exact joint sampling from the (frozen) full model. We show the
effectiveness of our approximate joint sampling for both pretrained-only
(Dream-7B-Base) and instruction-tuned (Dream-7B-Instruct) models on language
modeling and math \& coding tasks. When four tokens are unmasked for each
full-model denoising step, our sampling algorithm achieves a MAUVE score of
0.87 (vs marginal baseline of 0.31) with respect to the true joint
distribution.

### [360] [Painless Activation Steering: An Automated, Lightweight Approach for Post-Training Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22739)
*Sasha Cui,Zhongren Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAS is an automated activation steering method that improves LM behavior without manual prompt construction or feature labeling, showing strong results on behavior tasks but limited effects on intelligence tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current activation steering methods require manual prompt pairs or feature annotation, making them less convenient than plug-and-play methods like RL and SFT. PAS aims to provide a fully automated alternative.

Method: PAS uses automated activation steering with any labeled dataset, eliminating need for prompt construction or human intervention. It constructs fast, lightweight activation vectors that can be cheaply trained and stored.

Result: PAS reliably improves performance on behavior tasks (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, 34.8% on Alignment) but not on intelligence-oriented tasks. It also delivers additional gains on top of ICL and SFT.

Conclusion: PAS provides a practical, automated LM post-training option that characterizes where activation steering helps and where it fails, offering a fast, lightweight alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are typically post-trained for desired capabilities and
behaviors via weight-based or prompt-based steering, but the former is
time-consuming and expensive, and the latter is not precisely controllable and
often requires manual trial-and-error. While activation steering (AS) promises
a cheap, fast, and controllable alternative to the two existing post-training
methods, current AS techniques require hand-crafted prompt pairs or
labor-intensive feature annotation, making them more inconvenient than the
plug-and-play methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). We introduce Painless Activation Steering (PAS), a family of
fully automated methods that make AS readily usable with any given labeled
dataset, with no need for prompt construction, feature labeling, or human
intervention. We evaluate PAS on three open-weight models
(Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-8B, and Nous-Hermes-2) and 18 tasks;
we find that PAS reliably improves performance for behavior tasks, but not for
intelligence-oriented tasks. The introspective variant (iPAS) delivers the
strongest causal steering effects (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, and 34.8%
on Alignment). We also show PAS delivers additional gains on top of In-Context
Learning (ICL) and SFT. PAS constructs a fast, lightweight activation vector
that can be cheaply trained, easily stored, and activated at will. Our results
provide a characterization of where AS helps, where it fails, and how to deploy
it as a practical, automated LM post-training option.

### [361] [MIRAGE: Multi-hop Reasoning with Ambiguity Evaluation for Illusory Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22750)
*Jeonghyun Park,Ingeol Baek,Seunghyun Yoon,Haeun Jang,Aparna Garimella,Akriti Jain,Nedim Lipka,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIRAGE, a benchmark for evaluating multi-hop QA with ambiguity, and proposes CLARION framework that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with multi-hop QA involving ambiguity, where multiple reasoning paths emerge from single questions requiring independent resolution at each step.

Method: Created MIRAGE benchmark with 1,142 ambiguous multi-hop questions categorized by ambiguity types, and proposed CLARION multi-agent framework for handling ambiguity.

Result: Experiments show state-of-the-art models struggle on MIRAGE, confirming ambiguity resolution combined with multi-step inference is challenging. CLARION significantly outperforms existing approaches.

Conclusion: MIRAGE establishes the challenge of ambiguous multi-hop reasoning, and CLARION provides a robust baseline for developing more adaptive reasoning systems.

Abstract: Real-world Multi-hop Question Answering (QA) often involves ambiguity that is
inseparable from the reasoning process itself. This ambiguity creates a
distinct challenge, where multiple reasoning paths emerge from a single
question, each requiring independent resolution. Since each sub-question is
ambiguous, the model must resolve ambiguity at every step. Thus, answering a
single question requires handling multiple layers of ambiguity throughout the
reasoning chain. We find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle in
this setting, typically exploring wrong reasoning paths and producing
incomplete answers. To facilitate research on multi-hop ambiguity, we introduce
MultI-hop Reasoning with AmbiGuity Evaluation for Illusory Questions (MIRAGE),
a benchmark designed to analyze and evaluate this challenging intersection of
ambiguity interpretation and multi-hop reasoning. MIRAGE contains 1,142
high-quality examples of ambiguous multi-hop questions, categorized under a
taxonomy of syntactic, general, and semantic ambiguity, and curated through a
rigorous multi-LLM verification pipeline. Our experiments reveal that even
state-of-the-art models struggle on MIRAGE, confirming that resolving ambiguity
combined with multi-step inference is a distinct and significant challenge. To
establish a robust baseline, we propose CLarifying Ambiguity with a Reasoning
and InstructiON (CLARION), a multi-agent framework that significantly
outperforms existing approaches on MIRAGE, paving the way for more adaptive and
robust reasoning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML code generation benchmarks are mainly restricted to English, overlooking the global and multilingual nature of ML research and practice.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
in generating machine learning (ML) code, enabling end-to-end pipeline
construction from natural language instructions. However, existing benchmarks
for ML code generation are mainly restricted to English, overlooking the global
and multilingual nature of ML research and practice. To address this gap, we
present ML2B, the first benchmark for evaluating multilingual ML code
generation. ML2B consists of 30 Kaggle competitions translated into 13 natural
languages, covering tabular, text, and image data types, with structured
metadata and validated human-reviewed translations. For evaluation, we employ
AIDE, an automated framework for end-to-end assessment of data science
pipelines, and provide insights into cross-lingual model performance. Our
results reveal substantial 15-45% performance degradation on non-English tasks,
highlighting critical challenges in multilingual representation learning for
code generation. The benchmark, evaluation framework, and comprehensive results
are made available through our GitHub repository to facilitate future research
in multilingual ML code generation: https://github.com/enaix/ml2b.

### [363] [ArFake: A Multi-Dialect Benchmark and Baselines for Arabic Spoof-Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22808)
*Mohamed Maged,Alhassan Ehab,Ali Mekky,Besher Hassan,Shady Shehata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first multi-dialect Arabic spoofed speech dataset to address the challenge of detecting synthetic speech in Arabic, which has received limited research attention compared to English.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of generative text-to-speech models, distinguishing between real and synthetic speech has become challenging, especially for Arabic that have received limited research attention. Most spoof detection efforts have focused on English, leaving a significant gap for Arabic and its many dialects.

Method: Created a multi-dialect Arabic spoofed speech dataset and evaluated TTS models using: modern embedding-based methods with classifier heads; classical ML algorithms on MFCC features; RawNet2 architecture; Mean Opinion Score from human ratings; and Automatic Speech Recognition for Word Error Rate measurement.

Result: FishSpeech outperforms other TTS models in Arabic voice cloning on the Casablanca corpus, producing more realistic and challenging synthetic speech samples.

Conclusion: While FishSpeech performs best for Arabic voice cloning, relying on a single TTS for dataset creation may limit generalizability.

Abstract: With the rise of generative text-to-speech models, distinguishing between
real and synthetic speech has become challenging, especially for Arabic that
have received limited research attention. Most spoof detection efforts have
focused on English, leaving a significant gap for Arabic and its many dialects.
In this work, we introduce the first multi-dialect Arabic spoofed speech
dataset. To evaluate the difficulty of the synthesized audio from each model
and determine which produces the most challenging samples, we aimed to guide
the construction of our final dataset either by merging audios from multiple
models or by selecting the best-performing model, we conducted an evaluation
pipeline that included training classifiers using two approaches: modern
embedding-based methods combined with classifier heads; classical machine
learning algorithms applied to MFCC features; and the RawNet2 architecture. The
pipeline further incorporated the calculation of Mean Opinion Score based on
human ratings, as well as processing both original and synthesized datasets
through an Automatic Speech Recognition model to measure the Word Error Rate.
Our results demonstrate that FishSpeech outperforms other TTS models in Arabic
voice cloning on the Casablanca corpus, producing more realistic and
challenging synthetic speech samples. However, relying on a single TTS for
dataset creation may limit generalizability.

*Kai Zhang,Christopher Malon,Lichao Sun,Martin Renqiang Min*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EditGRPO is a mixed-policy RL algorithm that optimizes radiology report generation using clinically motivated rewards, outperforming SFT and vanilla GRPO baselines with improved clinical metrics and superior out-of-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs for radiology report generation use SFT objectives that are not explicitly aligned with clinical efficacy, lacking proper optimization for clinical outcomes.

Method: EditGRPO integrates on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance by injecting sentence-level detailed corrections during training rollouts, addressing RL exploration and sampling efficiency issues.

Result: Applied to Qwen2.5-VL-3B MLLM, EditGRPO achieves 3.4% average improvement in CheXbert, GREEN, Radgraph, and RATEScore metrics across four chest X-ray datasets, with 5.9% average gain on unseen datasets.

Conclusion: EditGRPO effectively optimizes radiology report generation for clinical efficacy through mixed-policy RL with clinical rewards, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Radiology report generation requires advanced medical image analysis,
effective temporal reasoning, and accurate text generation. Although recent
innovations, particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), have shown
improved performance, their supervised fine-tuning (SFT) objective is not
explicitly aligned with clinical efficacy. In this work, we introduce EditGRPO,
a mixed-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed specifically to
optimize the generation through clinically motivated rewards. EditGRPO
integrates on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance by injecting
sentence-level detailed corrections during training rollouts. This mixed-policy
approach addresses the exploration dilemma and sampling efficiency issues
typically encountered in RL. Applied to a Qwen2.5-VL-3B MLLM initialized with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), EditGRPO outperforms both SFT and vanilla GRPO
baselines, achieving an average improvement of 3.4% in CheXbert, GREEN,
Radgraph, and RATEScore metrics across four major chest X-ray report generation
datasets. Notably, EditGRPO also demonstrates superior out-of-domain
generalization, with an average performance gain of 5.9% on unseen datasets.

### [365] [Critique-Coder: Enhancing Coder Models by Critique Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22824)
*Chi Ruan,Dongfu Jiang,Yubo Wang,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Critique Reinforcement Learning (CRL) enhances standard RL by training models to generate critiques with binary judgments, improving reasoning and coding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL lacks explicit critique mechanisms, while recent studies show benefits of teaching LLMs to critique. CRL aims to complement RL by fostering critique abilities.

Method: Propose CRL where models generate critiques for (question, solution) pairs, rewarded by alignment of judgment labels with ground truth. Implement Critique-Coder using hybrid RL+CRL training (20% CRL data).

Result: Critique-Coder consistently outperforms RL-only baselines across benchmarks, achieving >60% on LiveCodeBench (v5) and beating models like DeepCoder-14B and GPT-o1. Also shows improved general reasoning on BBEH tasks.

Conclusion: CRL effectively complements standard RL for LLM reasoning, enhancing both coding performance and transferable general reasoning abilities through critique training.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a popular training paradigm,
particularly when paired with reasoning models. While effective, it primarily
focuses on generating responses and lacks mechanisms to explicitly foster
critique or reflection. Several recent studies, like Critique-Fine-Tuning (CFT)
and Critique-Guided-Distillation (CGD) have shown the benefits of explicitly
teaching LLMs how to critique. Motivated by them, we propose Critique
Reinforcement Learning (CRL), where the model is tasked with generating a
critique for a given (question, solution) pair. The reward is determined solely
by whether the final judgment label $c \in \{\texttt{True}, \texttt{False}\}$
of the generated critique aligns with the ground-truth judgment $c^*$. Building
on this point, we introduce \textsc{Critique-Coder}, which is trained on a
hybrid of RL and CRL by substituting 20\% of the standard RL data with CRL
data. We fine-tune multiple models (\textsc{Critique-Coder}) and evaluate them
on different benchmarks to show their advantages over RL-only models. We show
that \textsc{Critique-Coder} consistently outperforms RL-only baselines on all
the evaluated benchmarks. Notably, our \textsc{Critique-Coder-8B} can reach
over 60\% on LiveCodeBench (v5), outperforming other reasoning models like
DeepCoder-14B and GPT-o1. Beyond code generation, \textsc{Critique-Coder} also
demonstrates enhanced general reasoning abilities, as evidenced by its better
performance on logic reasoning tasks from the BBEH dataset. This indicates that
the application of CRL on coding datasets enhances general reasoning and
critique abilities, which are transferable across a broad range of tasks.
Hence, we believe that CRL works as a great complement to standard RL for LLM
reasoning.

### [366] [ChatInject: Abusing Chat Templates for Prompt Injection in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22830)
*Hwan Chang,Yonghyun Jun,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatInject is a novel attack that exploits LLM agents' vulnerability to structured chat templates and multi-turn persuasive dialogues, achieving significantly higher success rates than traditional prompt injection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing deployment of LLM-based agents interacting with external environments creates new attack surfaces, particularly indirect prompt injection where malicious instructions are embedded in environment output.

Method: ChatInject formats malicious payloads to mimic native chat templates and includes a multi-turn persuasion variant that primes agents across conversational turns to accept suspicious actions.

Result: ChatInject achieved 32.05% success rate on AgentDojo (vs 5.18% traditional) and 45.90% on InjecAgent (vs 15.13% traditional), with multi-turn variants reaching 52.33% success. The attack transfers well across models and bypasses existing defenses.

Conclusion: Current agent systems have significant vulnerabilities to chat-template-based attacks, especially multi-turn persuasion variants, and existing defenses are largely ineffective against this approach.

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language model (LLM) based agents that
interact with external environments has created new attack surfaces for
adversarial manipulation. One major threat is indirect prompt injection, where
attackers embed malicious instructions in external environment output, causing
agents to interpret and execute them as if they were legitimate prompts. While
previous research has focused primarily on plain-text injection attacks, we
find a significant yet underexplored vulnerability: LLMs' dependence on
structured chat templates and their susceptibility to contextual manipulation
through persuasive multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we introduce ChatInject,
an attack that formats malicious payloads to mimic native chat templates,
thereby exploiting the model's inherent instruction-following tendencies.
Building on this foundation, we develop a persuasion-driven Multi-turn variant
that primes the agent across conversational turns to accept and execute
otherwise suspicious actions. Through comprehensive experiments across frontier
LLMs, we demonstrate three critical findings: (1) ChatInject achieves
significantly higher average attack success rates than traditional prompt
injection methods, improving from 5.18% to 32.05% on AgentDojo and from 15.13%
to 45.90% on InjecAgent, with multi-turn dialogues showing particularly strong
performance at average 52.33% success rate on InjecAgent, (2)
chat-template-based payloads demonstrate strong transferability across models
and remain effective even against closed-source LLMs, despite their unknown
template structures, and (3) existing prompt-based defenses are largely
ineffective against this attack approach, especially against Multi-turn
variants. These findings highlight vulnerabilities in current agent systems.

### [367] [Learning to Detect Relevant Contexts and Knowledge for Response Selection in Retrieval-based Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22845)
*Kai Hua,Zhiyuan Feng,Chongyang Tao,Rui Yan,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes RSM-DCK, a multi-turn response selection model that detects relevant parts of context and knowledge to improve dialogue systems by filtering out irrelevant information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval-based dialogue systems use all context and knowledge content for matching, but much of this information is irrelevant due to topic shifts, which negatively impacts performance.

Method: Uses recent context as query to pre-select relevant context and knowledge at word/utterance levels, then interacts response candidate with selected content, and finally fuses context-response representation to post-select knowledge more confidently.

Result: Achieves better performance than existing methods on two benchmark datasets and effectively detects relevant context and knowledge for response selection.

Conclusion: The proposed RSM-DCK model successfully addresses the problem of irrelevant information in dialogue systems by selectively focusing on relevant context and knowledge parts, leading to improved response selection performance.

Abstract: Recently, knowledge-grounded conversations in the open domain gain great
attention from researchers. Existing works on retrieval-based dialogue systems
have paid tremendous efforts to utilize neural networks to build a matching
model, where all of the context and knowledge contents are used to match the
response candidate with various representation methods. Actually, different
parts of the context and knowledge are differentially important for recognizing
the proper response candidate, as many utterances are useless due to the topic
shift. Those excessive useless information in the context and knowledge can
influence the matching process and leads to inferior performance. To address
this problem, we propose a multi-turn \textbf{R}esponse \textbf{S}election
\textbf{M}odel that can \textbf{D}etect the relevant parts of the
\textbf{C}ontext and \textbf{K}nowledge collection (\textbf{RSM-DCK}). Our
model first uses the recent context as a query to pre-select relevant parts of
the context and knowledge collection at the word-level and utterance-level
semantics. Further, the response candidate interacts with the selected context
and knowledge collection respectively. In the end, The fused representation of
the context and response candidate is utilized to post-select the relevant
parts of the knowledge collection more confidently for matching. We test our
proposed model on two benchmark datasets. Evaluation results indicate that our
model achieves better performance than the existing methods, and can
effectively detect the relevant context and knowledge for response selection.

### [368] [Towards Generalizable Implicit In-Context Learning with Attention Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22854)
*Jiaqian Li,Yanshu Li,Ligong Han,Ruixiang Tang,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICR is a novel implicit in-context learning method that internalizes ICL patterns at the attention logits level, enabling zero-shot performance at few-shot cost without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing implicit ICL methods rely on injecting shift vectors from labeled demonstrations or task-specific alignment, which don't utilize structural ICL mechanisms and have limited generalizability.

Method: ICR extracts reusable structural directions that emerge during ICL and uses a learnable input-conditioned router to modulate attention logits, creating a train-once-and-reuse framework.

Result: ICR consistently outperforms prior implicit ICL methods on 12 real-world datasets across diverse domains and multiple LLMs, showing robust generalization to out-of-domain tasks where existing methods struggle.

Conclusion: ICR pushes the boundary of ICL's practical value by providing a more generalizable and effective approach to implicit in-context learning.

Abstract: Implicit in-context learning (ICL) has newly emerged as a promising paradigm
that simulates ICL behaviors in the representation space of Large Language
Models (LLMs), aiming to attain few-shot performance at zero-shot cost.
However, existing approaches largely rely on injecting shift vectors into
residual flows, which are typically constructed from labeled demonstrations or
task-specific alignment. Such designs fall short of utilizing the structural
mechanisms underlying ICL and suffer from limited generalizability. To address
this, we propose In-Context Routing (ICR), a novel implicit ICL method that
internalizes generalizable ICL patterns at the attention logits level. It
extracts reusable structural directions that emerge during ICL and employs a
learnable input-conditioned router to modulate attention logits accordingly,
enabling a train-once-and-reuse framework. We evaluate ICR on 12 real-world
datasets spanning diverse domains and multiple LLMs. The results show that ICR
consistently outperforms prior implicit ICL methods that require task-specific
retrieval or training, while demonstrating robust generalization to
out-of-domain tasks where existing methods struggle. These findings position
ICR to push the boundary of ICL's practical value.

*R. Alexander Knipper,Charles S. Knipper,Kaiqi Zhang,Valerie Sims,Clint Bowers,Santu Karmaker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large-scale evaluation of 45 LLMs reveals they exhibit cognitive biases in 17.8-57.3% of cases across 8 bias types, with model size and prompt specificity significantly affecting bias susceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in real-world decision-making, it's crucial to examine whether they exhibit the same cognitive biases that systematically distort human judgments in psychology.

Method: Introduced a novel evaluation framework using multiple-choice tasks, curated a dataset of 220 decision scenarios with psychologists, and generated diverse prompts from human-authored templates to analyze over 2.8 million LLM responses.

Result: LLMs showed bias-consistent behavior across anchoring, availability, confirmation, framing, interpretation, overattribution, prospect theory, and representativeness biases. Larger models (>32B parameters) reduced bias in 39.5% of cases, while detailed prompts reduced most biases by up to 14.9% except overattribution which increased by 8.8%.

Conclusion: LLMs do exhibit cognitive biases similar to humans, with model architecture and prompting strategies significantly influencing bias susceptibility, highlighting the need for careful deployment in decision-making applications.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in real-world
decision-making processes, it becomes crucial to examine the extent to which
they exhibit cognitive biases. Extensively studied in the field of psychology,
cognitive biases appear as systematic distortions commonly observed in human
judgments. This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of eight
well-established cognitive biases across 45 LLMs, analyzing over 2.8 million
LLM responses generated through controlled prompt variations. To achieve this,
we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on multiple-choice tasks,
hand-curate a dataset of 220 decision scenarios targeting fundamental cognitive
biases in collaboration with psychologists, and propose a scalable approach for
generating diverse prompts from human-authored scenario templates. Our analysis
shows that LLMs exhibit bias-consistent behavior in 17.8-57.3% of instances
across a range of judgment and decision-making contexts targeting anchoring,
availability, confirmation, framing, interpretation, overattribution, prospect
theory, and representativeness biases. We find that both model size and prompt
specificity play a significant role on bias susceptibility as follows: larger
size (>32B parameters) can reduce bias in 39.5% of cases, while higher prompt
detail reduces most biases by up to 14.9%, except in one case
(Overattribution), which is exacerbated by up to 8.8%.

*Passant Elchafei,Mayar Osama,Mohamed Rageh,Mervat Abuelkheir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A graph-based approach with lexicon enrichment for Arabic document readability prediction, combining GNN and transformer models via late fusion, achieving better document-level performance than standalone models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective method for predicting document-level readability in Arabic by leveraging linguistic relationships and lexical features, addressing the BAREC Shared Task 2025 challenge.

Method: Model documents as sentence-level graphs with nodes for sentences and lemmas, edges for linguistic relationships. Enrich sentence nodes with SAMER lexicon features and Arabic transformer embeddings. Train GNN and transformer as independent branches, combine via late fusion. Use max pooling for document-level aggregation.

Result: The hybrid method outperforms standalone GNN or transformer branches across multiple readability metrics. Fusion offers advantages at document level, while GNN-only approach remains stronger for sentence-level readability prediction.

Conclusion: Graph-based approach with lexicon enrichment and model fusion effectively predicts Arabic document readability, with fusion benefiting document-level performance and GNN excelling at sentence-level precision.

Abstract: We present a graph-based approach enriched with lexicons to predict
document-level readability in Arabic, developed as part of the Constrained
Track of the BAREC Shared Task 2025. Our system models each document as a
sentence-level graph, where nodes represent sentences and lemmas, and edges
capture linguistic relationships such as lexical co-occurrence and class
membership. Sentence nodes are enriched with features from the SAMER lexicon as
well as contextual embeddings from the Arabic transformer model. The graph
neural network (GNN) and transformer sentence encoder are trained as two
independent branches, and their predictions are combined via late fusion at
inference. For document-level prediction, sentence-level outputs are aggregated
using max pooling to reflect the most difficult sentence. Experimental results
show that this hybrid method outperforms standalone GNN or transformer branches
across multiple readability metrics. Overall, the findings highlight that
fusion offers advantages at the document level, but the GNN-only approach
remains stronger for precise prediction of sentence-level readability.

*Gabriela Pinto,Palash Goyal,Yiwen Song,Souradip Chakraborty,Zifeng Wang,Tomas Pfister,Hamid Palangi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HEART is a framework that uses emotionally-driven prompts for iterative self-correction in language models, improving reasoning performance through affective feedback based on six universal emotions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling strategies focus on logical refinement but ignore the potential of affective feedback, despite psychological evidence showing emotions can modulate cognitive performance.

Method: HEART provides feedback on incorrect responses using emotionally charged phrases based on Ekman's six universal emotions, systematically varying emotional tone across iterations to guide models away from flawed reasoning paths.

Result: When guided by an oracle verifier, HEART significantly improves reasoning accuracy on benchmarks like OlympiadBench, Humanity's Last Exam, and SimpleQA, but struggles in verifier-free settings.

Conclusion: The next frontier in machine reasoning may involve understanding and leveraging the 'HEART' of models, not just refining logic, with verifier-free deployment being a key challenge.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has shown considerable success in improving the performance
of language models on complex reasoning tasks without requiring fine-tuning.
However, current strategies such as self-reflection primarily focus on logical
or structural refinement. They do not leverage the guiding potential of
affective feedback. Inspired by psychological research showing that emotions
can modulate cognitive performance, we introduce HEART--a novel framework that
uses emotionally-driven prompts for iterative self-correction. HEART provides
feedback on a model's incorrect response using a curated set of concise,
emotionally charged phrases based on the six universal emotions categorized by
Dr. Paul Ekman. By systematically varying the emotional tone of the feedback
across iterations, our method guides the model to escape flawed reasoning paths
and explore more promising alternatives. We evaluate our framework on
challenging reasoning benchmarks including OlympiadBench, Humanity's Last Exam,
and SimpleQA. Our results reveal a significant new phenomenon: when guided by
an oracle verifier, this affective iteration protocol unlocks significantly
deeper reasoning, leading to consistent and substantial increases in accuracy
over state-of-the-art baselines with the same verifier. However, we also
identify a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. In a verifier-free
setting, it struggles to harness these gains consistently, highlighting as a
key challenge for future work. Our findings suggest that the next frontier in
machine reasoning may lie not just in refining logic, but also in understanding
and leveraging the `HEART' of the models.

*EunJeong Hwang,Yuwei Yin,Giuseppe Carenini,Peter West,Vered Shwartz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs that explicitly use Theory of Mind (ToM) achieve better dialogue performance and goal achievement. The proposed ToMAgent combines ToM with dialogue lookahead to generate maximally useful mental states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current chatbots and LLM-based social agents lack Theory of Mind understanding, which is crucial for human social intelligence. Integrating ToM could improve dialogue capabilities.

Method: Introduces ToMAgent (ToMA), trained by pairing ToM with dialogue lookahead to produce mental states that are maximally useful for achieving dialogue goals. Also shows that simply prompting models to generate mental states between dialogue turns provides benefits.

Result: Experiments on Sotopia benchmark show ToMA outperforms baselines. ToMA exhibits more strategic, goal-oriented reasoning, enables long-horizon adaptation, and maintains better partner relationships.

Conclusion: Explicit integration of Theory of Mind represents a step forward in building socially intelligent LLM agents, improving dialogue effectiveness and goal achievement.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM)-an understanding of the mental states of others-is a key
aspect of human social intelligence, yet, chatbots and LLM-based social agents
do not typically integrate it. In this work, we demonstrate that LLMs that
explicitly use ToM get better at dialogue, achieving goals more effectively.
After showing that simply prompting models to generate mental states between
dialogue turns already provides significant benefit, we further introduce
ToMAgent (ToMA), a ToM-focused dialogue agent. ToMA is trained by pairing ToM
with dialogue lookahead to produce mental states that are maximally useful for
achieving dialogue goals. Experiments on the Sotopia interactive social
evaluation benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over a range
of baselines. Comprehensive analysis shows that ToMA exhibits more strategic,
goal-oriented reasoning behaviors, which enable long-horizon adaptation, while
maintaining better relationships with their partners. Our results suggest a
step forward in integrating ToM for building socially intelligent LLM agents.

TL;DR: Extract-0 is a 7B parameter model optimized for document information extraction that outperforms larger models like GPT-4 through synthetic data generation, LoRA fine-tuning, and GRPO reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that task-specific optimization can create models that surpass general-purpose systems while using substantially fewer computational resources.

Method: Combines synthetic data generation (280,128 examples), supervised fine-tuning with LoRA (modifying only 0.53% of weights), and reinforcement learning with GRPO using semantic similarity-based rewards.

Result: Achieves mean reward of 0.573 on 1,000 document extraction tasks, outperforming GPT-4.1 (0.457), o3 (0.464), and GPT-4.1-2025 (0.459).

Conclusion: Task-specific optimization enables smaller models to exceed performance of much larger general-purpose models in specialized domains like document extraction.

Abstract: This paper presents Extract-0, a 7-billion parameter language model
specifically optimized for document information extraction that achieves
performance exceeding models with parameter counts several orders of magnitude
larger. Through a novel combination of synthetic data generation, supervised
fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and reinforcement learning via
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Extract-0 achieves a mean reward of
0.573 on a benchmark of 1,000 diverse document extraction tasks, outperforming
GPT-4.1 (0.457), o3 (0.464), and GPT-4.1-2025 (0.459). The training methodology
employs a memory-preserving synthetic data generation pipeline that produces
280,128 training examples from diverse document sources, followed by
parameterefficient fine-tuning that modifies only 0.53% of model weights (40.4M
out of 7.66B parameters). The reinforcement learning phase introduces a novel
semantic similarity-based reward function that handles the inherent ambiguity
in information extraction tasks. This research demonstrates that task-specific
optimization can yield models that surpass general-purpose systems while

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-4o performs poorly on medical medication tasks including drug-formulation matching, drug-drug interaction identification, and medication order preparation, highlighting the need for domain-specific training and better evaluation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the consistency of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o in recommending appropriate medication regimens, as few studies have assessed this capability despite LLMs' potential in medical diagnosis.

Method: Three experiments using GPT-4o: drug-formulation matching, drug-drug interaction identification (with and without web search), and medication order preparation. Evaluation used cosine similarity on TF-IDF vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, ROUGE-1/ROUGE-L F1 scores, and manual clinician assessment.

Result: Poor performance across all tests: 49% accuracy in drug-formulation matching with frequent omissions and hallucinations; inconsistent drug-drug interaction identification (54.7% vs 69.2% with web search); only 65.8% of medication orders contained no errors. Performance worsened with more formulations and when no interactions existed.

Conclusion: GPT-4o's overall poor performance on medication-related tasks indicates the need for domain-specific training using clinician-annotated datasets and development of comprehensive evaluation frameworks for benchmarking medical LLM performance.

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) can be useful in diagnosing medical
conditions, but few studies have evaluated their consistency in recommending
appropriate medication regimens. The purpose of this evaluation was to test
GPT-4o on three medication benchmarking tests including mapping a drug name to
its correct formulation, identifying drug-drug interactions using both its
internal knowledge and using a web search, and preparing a medication order
sentence after being given the medication name. Methods: Using GTP-4o three
experiments were completed. Accuracy was quantified by computing cosine
similarity on TF-IDF vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, and
ROUGE-1/ROUGE-L F1 between each response and its reference string or by manual
evaluation by clinicians. Results: GPT-4o performed poorly on drug-formulation
matching, with frequent omissions of available drug formulations (mean 1.23 per
medication) and hallucinations of formulations that do not exist (mean 1.14 per
medication). Only 49% of tested medications were correctly matched to all
available formulations. Accuracy was decreased for medications with more
formulations (p<0.0001). GPT-4o was also inconsistent at identifying
drug-drug-interactions, although it had better performance with the
search-augmented assessment compared to its internal knowledge (54.7% vs.
69.2%, p=0.013). However, allowing a web-search worsened performance when there
was no drug-drug interaction (median % correct 100% vs. 40%, p<0.001). Finally,
GPT-4o performed moderately with preparing a medication order sentence, with
only 65.8% of medication order sentences containing no medication or
abbreviation errors. Conclusions: Model performance was overall poor for all
tests. This highlights the need for domain-specific training through
clinician-annotated datasets and a comprehensive evaluation framework for
benchmarking performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SceneIllustrations dataset for narrative scene illustration using LLMs to prompt text-to-image models, showing LLMs effectively verbalize scene knowledge for generating story illustrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage generative AI for transforming text stories into visual illustrations, enabling cross-modal narrative transformation where visual illustrations can illuminate text-based stories.

Method: A pipeline using LLMs as interface for prompting text-to-image models to generate scene illustrations from raw story text, applied to a story corpus with human annotation for quality judgments.

Result: Created SceneIllustrations dataset with quality-annotated illustrations, demonstrating LLMs can effectively verbalize implicit scene knowledge from stories and this capability impacts illustration generation and evaluation.

Conclusion: LLMs serve as effective interfaces for cross-modal narrative transformation, enabling automatic generation of story illustrations and establishing SceneIllustrations as a resource for future work in this area.

Abstract: Generative AI has established the opportunity to readily transform content
from one medium to another. This capability is especially powerful for
storytelling, where visual illustrations can illuminate a story originally
expressed in text. In this paper, we focus on the task of narrative scene
illustration, which involves automatically generating an image depicting a
scene in a story. Motivated by recent progress on text-to-image models, we
consider a pipeline that uses LLMs as an interface for prompting text-to-image
models to generate scene illustrations given raw story text. We apply
variations of this pipeline to a prominent story corpus in order to synthesize
illustrations for scenes in these stories. We conduct a human annotation task
to obtain pairwise quality judgments for these illustrations. The outcome of
this process is the SceneIllustrations dataset, which we release as a new
resource for future work on cross-modal narrative transformation. Through our
analysis of this dataset and experiments modeling illustration quality, we
demonstrate that LLMs can effectively verbalize scene knowledge implicitly
evoked by story text. Moreover, this capability is impactful for generating and
evaluating illustrations.

### [376] [What Matters More For In-Context Learning under Matched Compute Budgets: Pretraining on Natural Text or Incorporating Targeted Synthetic Examples?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22947)
*Mohammed Sabry,Anya Belz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Explicitly exercising induction circuits during pretraining accelerates induction-head emergence but doesn't consistently improve in-context learning performance compared to natural text training under iso-FLOPs conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether targeted synthetic data can accelerate induction-head emergence and enhance in-context learning, challenging the assumption that early induction circuit activation directly improves ICL.

Method: Introduced Bi-Induct curriculum that injects forward-copy (Induction), backward-copy (Anti), or balanced mix into pretraining stream. Trained models from 0.13B to 1B parameters under iso-FLOPs, evaluating few-shot ICL benchmarks, head-level telemetry, and language modeling perplexity.

Result: Bi-Induct accelerates induction-head emergence at small scales but doesn't yield stronger generalization. Natural-only models perform best on function-style ICL probes. Larger natural-only models develop broader, earlier induction heads without explicit patterns. Perplexity penalties from synthetic data shrink with scale.

Conclusion: Inducing activation is not sufficient for ICL gains - circuits must become functionally necessary. Results emphasize mechanism-aware pretraining diagnostics and data mixtures that foster load-bearing structure rather than merely present circuits.

Abstract: Does explicitly exercising the induction circuit during pretraining improve
in-context learning (ICL), or is natural text sufficient when compute is held
constant (iso-FLOPs)? To test whether targeted synthetic data can accelerate
induction-head emergence and enhance ICL, we introduce Bi-Induct, a lightweight
curriculum that injects forward-copy (Induction), backward-copy (Anti), or a
balanced mix into the pretraining stream. We train models from 0.13B to 1B
parameters under iso-FLOPs, evaluating (i) few-shot ICL benchmarks, (ii)
head-level telemetry, and (iii) held-out language modeling perplexity. Our
findings challenge the assumption that early induction circuit activation
directly improves ICL. While Bi-Induct accelerates induction-head emergence at
small scales, this does not consistently yield stronger generalization. On
standard LM benchmarks, Bi-Induct matches natural-only training; on
function-style ICL probes, the 1B natural-only performs best. Stress tests
(e.g., label permutation, HITS@1 vs. HITS@3, 1 vs. 10 shots) preserve these
trends. Telemetry shows larger natural-only models develop broader, earlier
induction heads without explicit induction patterns. Anti-induction data fails
to elicit meaningful activation. Perplexity penalties from synthetic data
shrink with scale, suggesting larger models can absorb non-natural patterns
with minimal cost. Crucially, ablating the top 2% of induction heads degrades
ICL more than random ablations, especially for natural-only models, indicating
more centralized, load-bearing circuits. Bi-Induct variants exhibit more
redundant induction activity, implying different circuit utilization. Overall,
inducing activation is not sufficient: ICL gains depend on these circuits
becoming functionally necessary. These results underscore mechanism-aware
pretraining diagnostics and data mixtures that foster load-bearing, not merely
present, structure.

*Jon Gauthier,Canaan Breiss,Matthew Leonard,Edward F. Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-supervised speech models develop linear geometric representations that link English nouns and verbs to their regular inflected forms, tracking distributional relationships rather than distinct phonological or morphological units.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the types of linguistic representations that self-supervised speech models use for word recognition in noisy environments, particularly how they represent phonological and morphological phenomena in English noun and verb inflections.

Method: Study S3M variants optimized for word recognition by analyzing their representations of frequent English noun and verb inflections, examining the geometric structure of these representations.

Result: The models' representations exhibit a global linear geometry that can link English nouns and verbs to their regular inflected forms. This structure tracks regular distributional relationships in the English lexicon rather than distinct phonological or morphological units.

Conclusion: The findings suggest candidate representational strategies that may support human spoken word recognition and challenge the presumed necessity of distinct linguistic representations of phonology and morphology.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models can be trained to efficiently recognize spoken
words in naturalistic, noisy environments. However, we do not understand the
types of linguistic representations these models use to accomplish this task.
To address this question, we study how S3M variants optimized for word
recognition represent phonological and morphological phenomena in frequent
English noun and verb inflections. We find that their representations exhibit a
global linear geometry which can be used to link English nouns and verbs to
their regular inflected forms.
  This geometric structure does not directly track phonological or
morphological units. Instead, it tracks the regular distributional
relationships linking many word pairs in the English lexicon -- often, but not
always, due to morphological inflection. These findings point to candidate
representational strategies that may support human spoken word recognition,
challenging the presumed necessity of distinct linguistic representations of
phonology and morphology.

### [378] [Same Content, Different Representations: A Controlled Study for Table QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22983)
*Yue Zhang,Seiji Maekawa,Nikita Bhutani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first controlled study on how table representation affects Table QA performance, showing that different methods (SQL-based, LLMs, hybrid) have trade-offs across structured vs semi-structured data, with no single approach excelling in all conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Table QA benchmarks are tied to fixed data formats and haven't systematically examined how table representation itself affects model performance, despite real-world settings requiring operation over both structured databases and semi-structured tables.

Method: Used a verbalization pipeline to generate paired structured and semi-structured tables with identical content, enabling direct comparisons. Introduced a diagnostic benchmark with controlled splits along table size, join requirements, query complexity, and schema quality.

Result: SQL-based methods achieve high accuracy on structured inputs but degrade on semi-structured data; LLMs show flexibility but reduced precision; hybrid approaches balance these trade-offs, especially under noisy schemas. Effects intensify with larger tables and more complex queries.

Conclusion: No single method excels across all conditions, highlighting the central role of representation in Table QA performance. Findings provide actionable insights for model selection and design, pointing toward more robust hybrid approaches for diverse real-world data formats.

Abstract: Table Question Answering (Table QA) in real-world settings must operate over
both structured databases and semi-structured tables containing textual fields.
However, existing benchmarks are tied to fixed data formats and have not
systematically examined how representation itself affects model performance. We
present the first controlled study that isolates the role of table
representation by holding content constant while varying structure. Using a
verbalization pipeline, we generate paired structured and semi-structured
tables, enabling direct comparisons across modeling paradigms. To support
detailed analysis, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark with splits along table
size, join requirements, query complexity, and schema quality. Our experiments
reveal consistent trade-offs: SQL-based methods achieve high accuracy on
structured inputs but degrade on semi-structured data, LLMs exhibit flexibility
but reduced precision, and hybrid approaches strike a balance, particularly
under noisy schemas. These effects intensify with larger tables and more
complex queries. Ultimately, no single method excels across all conditions, and
we highlight the central role of representation in shaping Table QA
performance. Our findings provide actionable insights for model selection and
design, paving the way for more robust hybrid approaches suited for diverse
real-world data formats.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADAM is a framework for evaluating and improving MLLMs in biographical reasoning, featuring a multilingual multimodal dataset (AdamDB), cognitive evaluations (AdamBench), and a retrieval-augmented generation system (AdamRAG) to reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biography is a critical yet underexplored dimension of factual knowledge in LLMs, with no systematic examination of LLM capabilities in this domain previously.

Method: Created AdamDB (multilingual multimodal dataset covering 4M+ individuals), AdamBench (evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy across 6 reasoning levels), and AdamRAG (retrieval-augmented generation system for biographical contexts).

Result: AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits closed-source ones, with largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval.

Conclusion: ADAM establishes the first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally grounded biographical evaluation, advancing development of multilingual, accurate, and hallucination-resistant MLLMs.

Abstract: We introduce ADAM (A Diverse Archive of Mankind), a framework for evaluating
and improving multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in biographical
reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically examine LLM capabilities in biography, a critical yet
underexplored dimension of factual knowledge. At its core, AdamDB is a
multilingual and multimodal dataset covering over 4 million individuals across
geography, time, and profession, while AdamBench provides cognitively
structured evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy, spanning six reasoning levels
in both English and native languages. To address hallucinations, particularly
for lesser-known individuals, we propose AdamRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation system tailored to biographical contexts. Experiments show that
AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits
closed-source ones, with the largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity
strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers
smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval. ADAM establishes the
first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally

Conclusion: Successfully developed comprehensive LLM-generated corpora in English and Czech that serve as valuable resources for linguistic analysis and comparison between human-written and machine-generated texts.

Abstract: This article presents two corpora of English and Czech texts generated with
large language models (LLMs). The motivation is to create a resource for
comparing human-written texts with LLM-generated text linguistically. Emphasis
was placed on ensuring these resources are multi-genre and rich in terms of
topics, authors, and text types, while maintaining comparability with existing
human-created corpora. These generated corpora replicate reference human
corpora: BE21 by Paul Baker, which is a modern version of the original Brown
Corpus, and Koditex corpus that also follows the Brown Corpus tradition but in
Czech. The new corpora were generated using models from OpenAI, Anthropic,
Alphabet, Meta, and DeepSeek, ranging from GPT-3 (davinci-002) to GPT-4.5, and
are tagged according to the Universal Dependencies standard (i.e., they are
tokenized, lemmatized, and morphologically and syntactically annotated). The
subcorpus size varies according to the model used (the English part contains on
average 864k tokens per model, 27M tokens altogether, the Czech partcontains on
average 768k tokens per model, 21.5M tokens altogether). The corpora are freely
available for download under the CC BY 4.0 license (the annotated data are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 'memorize while reading' methods for long-context QA suffer from irreversible forward-only processing, information loss through overwriting, and sparse reinforcement learning signals when key evidence is dispersed across millions of tokens.

Method: Proposes ReMemR1 with callback-enhanced memory allowing selective retrieval from entire memory history and non-linear reasoning, plus Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Level Rewards (RLMLR) combining final-answer rewards with dense step-level signals.

Result: Experiments on long-document QA show significant gains over existing memory-based approaches, validating ReMemR1 as an effective solution for long-context reasoning agents.

Conclusion: The proposed approach mitigates information degradation, improves supervision, and supports multi-hop memory utilization in long-context question answering tasks.

Abstract: Large language models face challenges in long-context question answering,
where key evidence of a query may be dispersed across millions of tokens.
Existing works equip large language models with a memory corpus that is
dynamically updated during a single-pass document scan, also known as the
"memorize while reading" methods. While this approach scales efficiently, it
suffers from irreversible forward-only processing, information loss through
overwriting, and sparse reinforcement learning signals. To tackle these
challenges, we present ReMemR1, a memory-augmented agent with callback-enhanced
memory that allows selective retrieval from the entire memory history and
allows non-linear reasoning and revisiting of early evidence. To further
strengthen training, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Level Rewards
(RLMLR), which combines final-answer rewards with dense, step-level signals
that guide effective memory use. Together, these contributions mitigate
information degradation, improve supervision, and support multi-hop memory
utilizing. Experiments on long-document QA show significant gains over existing
memory-based approaches, which validates ReMemR1 as an effective solution for
long-context reasoning agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs' sycophancy causes premature consensus in multi-agent debates, reducing accuracy. The paper introduces a framework to define, measure, and address this issue, revealing distinct failure modes and proposing design principles for better debate systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' sycophancy undermines multi-agent debating systems by causing premature consensus, but prior research has focused on user-LLM sycophancy while ignoring inter-agent sycophancy in debate settings.

Method: Developed an operational framework with: (1) formal definition of sycophancy in MADS, (2) new metrics to evaluate agent sycophancy and its impact, (3) systematic investigation of sycophancy effects across agent roles in both decentralized and centralized debate frameworks.

Result: Sycophancy is a core failure mode that amplifies disagreement collapse, yields lower accuracy than single-agent baselines, and arises from distinct debater-driven and judge-driven failure modes.

Conclusion: Proposed actionable design principles for MADS to effectively balance productive disagreement with cooperation in agent interactions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often display sycophancy, a tendency toward
excessive agreeability. This behavior poses significant challenges for
multi-agent debating systems (MADS) that rely on productive disagreement to
refine arguments and foster innovative thinking. LLMs' inherent sycophancy can
collapse debates into premature consensus, potentially undermining the benefits
of multi-agent debate. While prior studies focus on user--LLM sycophancy, the
impact of inter-agent sycophancy in debate remains poorly understood. To
address this gap, we introduce the first operational framework that (1)
proposes a formal definition of sycophancy specific to MADS settings, (2)
develops new metrics to evaluate the agent sycophancy level and its impact on
information exchange in MADS, and (3) systematically investigates how varying
levels of sycophancy across agent roles (debaters and judges) affects outcomes
in both decentralized and centralized debate frameworks. Our findings reveal
that sycophancy is a core failure mode that amplifies disagreement collapse
before reaching a correct conclusion in multi-agent debates, yields lower
accuracy than single-agent baselines, and arises from distinct debater-driven
and judge-driven failure modes. Building on these findings, we propose
actionable design principles for MADS, effectively balancing productive
disagreement with cooperation in agent interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes semantic voting as a self-evaluation-free approach for unverifiable tasks like translation, using semantic similarity instead of exact matching to enable lightweight self-improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of self-evaluation methods for unverifiable tasks, which suffer from high computational overhead and overconfidence issues due to LLM biases.

Method: Semantic voting that replaces hard matching (exact matching) with soft matching (semantic similarity) using lightweight sentence embedding models.

Result: Achieves substantial gains in computational efficiency and better overall performance than self-evaluation methods across diverse model architectures and tasks.

Conclusion: Semantic voting provides an effective and efficient alternative to self-evaluation for self-improvement in unverifiable tasks, overcoming computational burden and bias limitations.

Abstract: The rising cost of acquiring supervised data has driven significant interest
in self-improvement for large language models (LLMs). Straightforward
unsupervised signals like majority voting have proven effective in generating
pseudo-labels for verifiable tasks, while their applicability to unverifiable
tasks (e.g., translation) is limited by the open-ended character of responses.
As a result, self-evaluation mechanisms (e.g., self-judging and entropy
minimization) are predominantly used to derive pseudo-labels. However,
self-evaluation relying on LLMs typically incurs high computational overhead
and introduces overconfidence issues due to intrinsic biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel self-evaluation-free approach for unverifiable
tasks, designed for lightweight yet effective self-improvement. Inspired by
majority voting commonly employed in verifiable tasks, we propose semantic
voting as a novel mechanism that relaxes the principle of hard matching (i.e.,
exact matching) toward soft matching (i.e., semantic similarity). Soft matching
is achieved by leveraging a lightweight sentence embedding model to quantify
semantic similarity, thereby mitigating excessive computational burden and
intrinsic bias-associated limitations of self-evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial gains in
computational efficiency and overall better performance than self-evaluation
methods across diverse model architectures and tasks.

TL;DR: EviPath is a new paradigm for synthesizing evidence-anchored reasoning paths to train RAG agents, enabling LLMs to learn complex reasoning and tool-use capabilities through supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG agent development lacks process-level supervision for guiding agentic capabilities like task decomposition and stepwise decision-making. Existing methods only produce chain-of-thought rationales without modeling environmental interactions.

Method: EviPath has three components: (1) Abductive Subtask Planning for problem decomposition and optimal path planning, (2) Faithful Sub-question Answering using evidence to generate reasoning, and (3) Conversational Fine-Tuning to format interactions into dialogue for supervised fine-tuning.

Result: An 8B parameter model trained with EviPath-synthesized data achieves significant performance improvements, with a 14.7% absolute EM gain in open-domain question answering, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: EviPath enables effective training of RAG agents by synthesizing evidence-anchored reasoning paths, allowing LLMs to learn complex reasoning and tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation agents development is hindered by the lack of
process-level supervision to effectively guide agentic capabilities like task
decomposition, retriever invocation, and stepwise decision-making. While
reinforcement learning offers a potential solution, it suffers from sparse
rewards and the limited reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
Meanwhile, existing data synthesis methods only produce chain-of-thought
rationales and fail to model environmental interactions. In this paper, we
propose EviPath, an evidence-anchored reasoning path synthesis paradigm for RAG
agent development. EviPath comprises: (i) Abductive Subtask Planning, which
decomposes the problem into sub-questions and iteratively plans an optimal
solution path based on the dependencies between them; (ii) Faithful
Sub-question Answering, which uses supporting evidence to construct a proxy
environment to generate reasoning thoughts and answers for each sub-question;
and (iii) Conversational Fine-Tuning, which formats the complete
agent-environment interaction trajectory into a dialogue format suitable for
Supervised Fine-Tuning. EviPath allows LLMs to learn complex reasoning and
tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data. Extensive experiments on
widely-used question-answering benchmarks show that an 8B parameter model
trained with EviPath-synthesized data significantly and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a double-digit absolute EM gain of
14.7% in open-domain question answering.

Motivation: Understanding uncertainty in large language models for creative tasks where multiple valid outputs exist remains a fundamental challenge.

Method: Analyzed 500 creative writing prompts with 10 human continuations each, evaluated four language models across five decoding strategies (100,000 stories total) using credal sets - convex hulls of probability distributions.

Result: Substantial gaps in capturing human creative variation, with best model-human calibration reaching only 0.434. Decoding strategy contributes 39.4% to 72.0% of total epistemic uncertainty. Model scale shows weak correlation with calibration quality.

Conclusion: The geometric framework provides actionable insights for improving generation systems for human-AI creative alignment, with complete experimental framework released.

Abstract: Understanding uncertainty in large language models remains a fundamental
challenge, particularly in creative tasks where multiple valid outputs exist.
We present a geometric framework using credal sets - convex hulls of
probability distributions - to quantify and decompose uncertainty in neural
text generation, calibrated against human creative variation. Analyzing 500
creative writing prompts from the WritingPrompts dataset with 10 unique human
continuations each, we evaluate four language models across five decoding
strategies, generating 100,000 stories. Our credal set analysis reveals
substantial gaps in capturing human creative variation, with the best
model-human calibration reaching only 0.434 (Gemma-2B with temperature 0.7). We
decompose total uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, finding
that the choice of decoding strategy contributes 39.4% to 72.0% of total
epistemic uncertainty. Model scale shows weak correlation with calibration
quality and no significant difference exists between base and instruction-tuned
models in calibration quality. Our geometric framework provides actionable
insights for improving generation systems for human-AI creative alignment. We
release our complete experimental framework.

TL;DR: d²Cache is a training-free KV cache framework that accelerates diffusion-based LLM inference through adaptive token selection and caching, achieving both speed improvements and better generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based LLMs suffer from inferior inference efficiency due to bidirectional attention that prevents them from benefiting from standard KV caching like autoregressive models.

Method: Two-stage fine-grained selection strategy to identify tokens and adaptively update their KV states at each decoding step, while caching remaining tokens for reuse. Enables quasi left-to-right generation.

Result: Achieves substantial inference speedups and consistent improvements in generation quality on LLaDA and Dream models.

Conclusion: d²Cache effectively addresses dLLM inference efficiency issues while improving generation reliability through adaptive caching and quasi left-to-right decoding.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), despite their promising
performance, still suffer from inferior inference efficiency. This is because
dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention and cannot directly benefit from the
standard key-value (KV) cache as autoregressive models (ARMs) do. To tackle
this issue, we introduce \textit{Dual aDaptive Cache} (d$^2$Cache), which is a
training-free approximate KV cache framework for accelerating dLLM inference.
d$^2$Cache features a two-stage fine-grained selection strategy to identify
tokens and adaptively update their KV states at each decoding step, while
caching the KV states of the remaining tokens for reuse. Furthermore,
d$^2$Cache naturally offers a more reliable decoding alternative, which can
enable quasi left-to-right generation and mitigate premature overconfidence in
tokens at the end of the sequence. Extensive experimental results on two
representative dLLMs (\ie, LLaDA and Dream) demonstrate that d$^2$Cache not
only achieves substantial inference speedups, but also yields consistent

TL;DR: SmiSelf is a cross-chemical language framework that converts invalid SMILES to SELFIES using grammatical rules, ensuring 100% valid molecule generation while preserving molecular characteristics and maintaining performance on other metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and materials science, but LLMs struggle to generate valid molecules using SMILES representation in few-shot settings. The goal is to enable 100% valid molecule generation using LLMs.

Method: SmiSelf framework converts invalid SMILES to SELFIES using grammatical rules, leveraging SELFIES' mechanisms to correct invalid SMILES. This cross-chemical language approach ensures validity while maintaining molecular properties.

Result: SmiSelf ensures 100% validity while preserving molecular characteristics and maintaining or even enhancing performance on other metrics. It's compatible with all SMILES-based generative models.

Conclusion: SmiSelf successfully expands LLMs' practical applications in biomedicine by solving the validity problem in molecule generation, providing a framework that works with existing SMILES-based models while guaranteeing valid outputs.

Abstract: Molecule generation is key to drug discovery and materials science, enabling
the design of novel compounds with specific properties. Large language models
(LLMs) can learn to perform a wide range of tasks from just a few examples.
However, generating valid molecules using representations like SMILES is
challenging for LLMs in few-shot settings. In this work, we explore how LLMs
can generate 100% valid molecules. We evaluate whether LLMs can use SELFIES, a
representation where every string corresponds to a valid molecule, for valid
molecule generation but find that LLMs perform worse with SELFIES than with
SMILES. We then examine LLMs' ability to correct invalid SMILES and find their
capacity limited. Finally, we introduce SmiSelf, a cross-chemical language
framework for invalid SMILES correction. SmiSelf converts invalid SMILES to
SELFIES using grammatical rules, leveraging SELFIES' mechanisms to correct the
invalid SMILES. Experiments show that SmiSelf ensures 100% validity while
preserving molecular characteristics and maintaining or even enhancing
performance on other metrics. SmiSelf helps expand LLMs' practical applications
in biomedicine and is compatible with all SMILES-based generative models. Code

Simulation TL;DR: A non-collaborative user simulation method for tool agent.
Abstract: Tool agents interact with users through multi-turn dialogues to
accomplish various tasks. Recent studies have adopted user simulation methods
to develop these agents in multi-turn settings. However, existing user
simulators tend to be agent-friendly, exhibiting only cooperative behaviors,
which fails to train and test agents against non-collaborative users in the
real world. To address this, we propose a novel user simulator architecture
that simulates four categories of non-collaborative behaviors: requesting
unavailable services, digressing into tangential conversations, expressing
impatience, and providing incomplete utterances. Our user simulator can
simulate challenging and natural non-collaborative behaviors while reliably
delivering all intents and information necessary to accomplish the task. Our
experiments on MultiWOZ and $\tau$-bench reveal significant performance
degradation in state-of-the-art tool agents when encountering non-collaborative
users. We provide detailed analyses of agents' weaknesses under each
non-collaborative condition, such as escalated hallucinations and dialogue
breakdowns. Ultimately, we contribute an easily extensible user simulation
framework to help the research community develop tool agents and preemptively
diagnose them under challenging real-world conditions within their own
services.

TL;DR: TagPR enhances LLMs' personalization reasoning through a tagging approach with supervised fine-tuning and multi-stage reinforcement learning guided by composite rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with personalization reasoning - analyzing user history and generating tailored responses based on individual preferences.

Method: Data-driven pipeline generates semantically labeled reasoning chains, followed by SFT and multi-stage RL with composite rewards including tag constraints and PRMU.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results with 32.65% average improvement over base model on LaMP benchmark and self-constructed dataset.

Conclusion: Structured, interpretable reasoning is an effective pathway to unlocking genuine personalization capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements have endowed Large Language Models (LLMs) with impressive
general reasoning capabilities, yet they often struggle with personalization
reasoning - the crucial ability to analyze user history, infer unique
preferences, and generate tailored responses. To address this limitation, we
introduce TagPR, a novel training framework that significantly enhances an
LLM's intrinsic capacity for personalization reasoning through a tagging the
thought approach. Our method first develops a data-driven pipeline to
automatically generate and semantically label reasoning chains, creating a
structured dataset that fosters interpretable reasoning. We then propose a
synergistic training strategy that begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on
this tagged data to establish foundational reasoning patterns, followed by a
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) process. This RL phase is guided by a
unique composite reward signal, which integrates tag-based constraints and a
novel Personalization Reward Model with User Embeddings (PRMU) to achieve
fine-grained alignment with user-specific logic. Extensive experiments on the
public LaMP benchmark and a self-constructed dataset demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results, delivering an average improvement
of 32.65% over the base model across all tasks. Our work validates that
structured, interpretable reasoning is a highly effective pathway to unlocking
genuine personalization capabilities in LLMs.

### [390] [Tree Reward-Aligned Search for TReASURe in Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23146)
*Zichao Yu,Ming Li,Wenyi Zhang,Weiguo Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TReASURe is a tree-search test-time alignment method for Masked Diffusion Language Models that introduces UnmaskBranch for diversified branching and ResubstituteScore for stable pruning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree search for aligning generative models faces challenges with Masked Diffusion Language Models: parallel unmasking creates correlated branches limiting exploration, and reward evaluation via sampled completions produces high-variance estimates making pruning unstable.

Method: TReASURe introduces two key components: (1) UnmaskBranch - a branching strategy based on first-hitting unmasking that diversifies token content and reveal order with one model call per parent node, and (2) ResubstituteScore - a pruning rule using deterministic resubstitution to score partially masked sequences with low-variance proxy completions.

Result: Theoretically, TReASURe shows branching efficiency gains in NFEs, approximates true reward with error bounded by predictive uncertainty, and improves with larger tree widths. Empirically, it achieves state-of-the-art results on perplexity, linguistic acceptability, and control of sentiment and toxicity, outperforming prior methods under matched compute budgets, especially in low-NFE regimes.

Conclusion: TReASURe effectively addresses the key challenges of tree search for Masked Diffusion Language Models through innovative branching and scoring strategies, demonstrating superior performance across multiple metrics and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Tree search has recently emerged as a powerful framework for aligning
generative models with task-specific rewards at test time. Applying tree search
to Masked Diffusion Language Models, however, introduces two key challenges:
(i) parallel unmasking yields highly correlated branches, limiting exploration,
and (ii) reward evaluation via sampled completions produces high-variance
estimates, making pruning unstable. We propose TReASURe, a tree-search
test-time alignment method that addresses these issues. It introduces (i)
UnmaskBranch, a branching strategy based on first-hitting unmasking that
diversifies both token content and reveal order with a single model call per
parent node, and (ii) ResubstituteScore, a pruning rule that uses deterministic
resubstitution to score partially masked sequences with low-variance proxy
completions. Theoretically, we quantify branching efficiency gains in NFEs
(number of function evaluations), show that the scoring rule approximates the
true reward with error bounded by predictive uncertainty, and prove
improvements with larger tree widths. Empirically, TReASURe achieves
state-of-the-art results on perplexity, linguistic acceptability, and control
of sentiment and toxicity, outperforming prior methods under matched compute
budgets, with especially strong gains in low-NFE regimes.

*Chenxing Wei,Hong Wang,Ying He,Fei Yu,Yao Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes T2PAM, a new paradigm for adapting LLMs during multi-turn interactions using real-time user feedback, and introduces ROSA, a lightweight algorithm that enables efficient one-step policy adaptation toward user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with extended interactions because they are trained on static, single-turn data and cannot adapt to real-time user feedback, leading to performance degradation in multi-turn conversations.

Method: The authors propose Test-Time Policy Adaptation for Multi-Turn Interactions (T2PAM) paradigm and implement it through Optimum-Referenced One-Step Adaptation (ROSA) - a lightweight algorithm that uses user feedback as reward signals to estimate optimal policies and updates a small parameter subset in a single efficient step.

Result: Extensive experiments show ROSA achieves significant improvements in both task effectiveness and efficiency. Theoretical analysis guarantees policy convergence to user preferences as interactions increase.

Conclusion: ROSA enables efficient in-conversation self-correction for LLMs through lightweight one-step adaptation, overcoming limitations of static training and improving performance in extended multi-turn interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) employ multi-turn interaction as a fundamental
paradigm for completing complex tasks. However, their performance often
degrades in extended interactions, as they are typically trained on static,
single-turn data, which hinders their ability to adapt to real-time user
feedback. To address this limitation, we first propose a new paradigm:
Test-Time Policy Adaptation for Multi-Turn Interactions (T2PAM), which utilizes
user feedback from the ongoing interaction as a reward signal to estimate a
latent optimal policy aligned with user preferences, then updates a small
subset of parameters to steer the model toward this policy, ultimately enabling
efficient in-conversation self-correction. We then introduce Optimum-Referenced
One-Step Adaptation (ROSA), a lightweight algorithm that operationalizes T2PAM.
ROSA guides the model parameters toward a theoretical optimal policy in a
single, efficient update step, avoiding costly iterative gradient-based
optimization and minimizing computational overhead. We provide a rigorous
theoretical analysis guaranteeing that the policy of ROSA converges to the
preference of user as the number of interactions increases. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmark demonstrate that ROSA achieves significant
improvements in both task effectiveness and efficiency.

*Boyi Zeng,He Li,Shixiang Song,Yixuan Wang,Ziwei He,Xinbing Wang,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pretraining Language Models with Latent Thoughts introduces intermediate latent thoughts (hidden states) during pretraining to refine token predictions, achieving better performance than standard models with double the parameters at same inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by Chain-of-Thought's success in scaling generation steps at test-time, the authors explore whether scaling computational steps during pretraining can improve individual token generation.

Method: Pretrains LM to first generate intermediate latent thoughts (last hidden states) which are then used as input to predict subsequent tokens, allowing refinement in continuous space. Can generate multiple latent thoughts forming a chain before each token.

Result: At identical inference cost, a 1.4B model with latent thoughts outperforms vanilla 2.8B model on language modeling and downstream tasks. Performance consistently improves with more latent thoughts.

Conclusion: Scaling computational steps during pretraining through latent thoughts is an effective approach that significantly enhances model performance without increasing inference cost.

Abstract: The remarkable success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which enhances performance
by scaling generation steps at test-time, inspires us to ask: can we leverage a
similar scaling of computational steps during pretraining to improve the
generation of each individual token? To address this, we propose a novel
pre-training methodology: Pretraining Language Models with Latent Thoughts. Our
approach pretrains a language model (LM) to first generate an intermediate
latent thought-the last hidden state of the current position-which is then used
as input to predict the actual subsequent token. This additional computational
step enables the LM to refine its prediction within unconstrained continuous
space. Our experiments demonstrate that, at an identical inference cost, a LM
that generates one additional latent thought per token outperforms a standard
model with double the parameters. For instance, ours-1.4B (Pythia Arch),
pretrained on 300B tokens from the Pile, significantly surpasses the vanilla
Pythia-2.8B trained on the same data on both language modeling and a range of
general downstream tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of latent thoughts
generated before each actual token-forming a chain analogous to
CoT-consistently improves the model's performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to address hierarchical compliance failures in LLM-powered multi-agent systems under instruction conflicts, using diagnosis, localization, and surgical alignment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-powered multi-agent systems face reliability issues due to hierarchical compliance failures when agents misprioritize system-level rules under competing instructions, and current metrics don't provide actionable guidance for fixing these micro-level violations.

Method: Three-stage framework: (1) Diagnose with Contextualized Role Adherence Score (CRAS) measuring four role adherence dimensions; (2) Localize instruction conflict resolution to middle-layer attention heads; (3) Align using Surgical Alignment of Instruction Layers (SAIL) with LoRA on focal layers and token-weighted DPO-style preference optimization.

Result: The surgical approach improves instruction hierarchy compliance (e.g., +5.60% with AutoGen on MedQA) without requiring full-model finetuning, across standard benchmarks and MAS frameworks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses hierarchical compliance failures in multi-agent systems through targeted diagnosis, localization, and surgical alignment, enabling more reliable deployment without full-model retraining.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have rapidly
advanced collaborative reasoning, tool use, and role-specialized coordination
in complex tasks. However, reliability-critical deployment remains hindered by
a systemic failure mode: hierarchical compliance under instruction conflicts
(system-user, peer-peer), where agents misprioritize system-level rules in the
presence of competing demands. Moreover, widely used macro-level metrics (e.g.,
pass@k) obscure these micro-level violations and offer little actionable
guidance for remedy. In this work, we present a full-stack, three-stage
framework: (1) Diagnose - Contextualized Role Adherence Score (CRAS), a
query-wise, context-aware scoring metric that decomposes role adherence into
four measurable dimensions; (2) Localize - attention drift analysis revealing
that instruction conflicts are resolved by attention heads that are largely
concentrated in middle layers; (3) Align - Surgical Alignment of Instruction
Layers (SAIL), which installs LoRA only on the localized focal layers and
optimizes a token-weighted DPO-style preference objective that credits tokens
by their focal attentional contribution. Across standard benchmarks and MAS
frameworks, our surgical approach improves instruction hierarchy compliance
(e.g., +5.60% with AutoGen on MedQA) without full-model finetuning.

*Nan Wang,Jiaxuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses EEG and eye-tracking data to show that phrase structure construction precedes syntactic category detection during natural reading, challenging traditional violation paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To disentangle syntactic category detection and phrase structure construction processes, which are conflated in traditional violation paradigms that assume phrase structure follows category detection.

Method: Used co-registered EEG and eye-tracking data from ZuCo corpus, analyzed gaze transitions, applied Bayesian network modeling, and examined fixation-related potentials during naturalistic reading.

Result: Readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads; structural depth was strongest driver of reading deviations; syntactic surprisal influenced neural activity before word onset and during early integration.

Conclusion: Phrase structure construction can precede category detection and dominate lexical influences, supporting a predictive 'tree-scaffolding' account of comprehension.

Abstract: A central question in psycholinguistics is the timing of syntax in sentence
processing. Much of the existing evidence comes from violation paradigms, which
conflate two separable processes - syntactic category detection and phrase
structure construction - and implicitly assume that phrase structure follows
category detection. In this study, we use co-registered EEG and eye-tracking
data from the ZuCo corpus to disentangle these processes and test their
temporal order under naturalistic reading conditions. Analyses of gaze
transitions showed that readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads,
suggesting that phrase structures, rather than serial word order, organize
scanpaths. Bayesian network modeling further revealed that structural depth was
the strongest driver of deviations from linear reading, outweighing lexical
familiarity and surprisal. Finally, fixation-related potentials demonstrated
that syntactic surprisal influences neural activity before word onset (-184 to
-10 ms) and during early integration (48 to 300 ms). These findings extend
current models of syntactic timing by showing that phrase structure
construction can precede category detection and dominate lexical influences,
supporting a predictive "tree-scaffolding" account of comprehension.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Insight-to-Solve (I2S), a method that converts in-context demonstrations into explicit insights to improve reasoning in LLMs, addressing the paradox where more demonstrations degrade performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent reasoning LLMs perform worse with few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) than with direct answering, even with optimal demonstrations. The goal is to understand and overcome this performance degradation.

Method: I2S is a sequential test-time procedure that turns demonstrations into explicit, reusable insights and derives target-specific reasoning traces. I2S+ adds self-refinement for coherence and correctness.

Result: I2S and I2S+ consistently outperform direct answering and test-time scaling baselines across diverse benchmarks and models. GPT-4.1 improved by +14.0% on AIME'25, and o1-mini by +2.7% on AIME and +1.7% on GPQA.

Conclusion: In-context demonstrations can be effectively harnessed through the insight-refine-solve framework, overcoming semantic misguidance and strategy transfer failure.

Abstract: Recent reasoning LLMs (RLMs), especially those trained with verifier-based
reinforcement learning, often perform worse with few-shot CoT than with direct
answering. We revisit this paradox using high-quality reasoning traces from
DeepSeek-R1 as demonstrations and find that adding more exemplars consistently
degrades accuracy, even when demonstrations are optimal. A detailed analysis
reveals two mechanisms behind this decline: (i) semantic misguidance, where
high textual similarity leads the model to treat the target as the same as the
exemplar and to copy intermediate steps verbatim; and (ii) strategy transfer
failure, where the model struggles to extract useful reasoning strategies and
apply them to target questions. Guided by these, we introduce Insight-to-Solve
(I2S), a sequential test-time procedure that turns demonstrations into
explicit, reusable insights and derives a target-specific reasoning trace;
optionally, the reasoning is self-refined for coherence and correctness (I2S+).
Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that I2S and I2S+ consistently
outperform both direct answering and test-time scaling baselines across open-
and closed-source models. Even for GPT models, our method helps: on AIME'25,
GPT-4.1 rises by +14.0%, and o1-mini improves by +2.7% on AIME and +1.7% on
GPQA, indicating that in-context demonstrations can be harnessed effectively
via insight-refine-solve framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of code-switching in globally successful K-pop songs shows English dominates lyrics, with high code-switching frequency but no significant gender differences, though female solo artists use more English consistently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate linguistic strategies in K-pop songs achieving global chart success, focusing on code-switching and English usage patterns.

Method: Compiled dataset of K-pop songs on Billboard Hot 100 and Global 200 charts (2017-2025), analyzed English/Korean proportions, code-switching frequency, and performed gender classification using multilingual embeddings and handcrafted features.

Result: English dominates globally charting K-pop songs; no significant gender differences in code-switching; female solo artists use more English; gender classification achieved 0.76 F1 score; higher English usage may be more critical for US-focused Hot 100 success.

Conclusion: Linguistic choices in K-pop lyrics are shaped by global market pressures, revealing stylistic patterns that reflect performer identity and chart context.

Abstract: Code switching, particularly between Korean and English, has become a
defining feature of modern K-pop, reflecting both aesthetic choices and global
market strategies. This paper is a primary investigation into the linguistic
strategies employed in K-pop songs that achieve global chart success, with a
focus on the role of code-switching and English lyric usage. A dataset of K-pop
songs that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 and Global 200 charts from 2017 to
2025, spanning 14 groups and 8 solo artists, was compiled. Using this dataset,
the proportion of English and Korean lyrics, the frequency of code-switching,
and other stylistic features were analysed. It was found that English dominates
the linguistic landscape of globally charting K-pop songs, with both male and
female performers exhibiting high degrees of code-switching and English usage.
Statistical tests indicated no significant gender-based differences, although
female solo artists tend to favour English more consistently. A classification
task was also performed to predict performer gender from lyrics, achieving
macro F1 scores up to 0.76 using multilingual embeddings and handcrafted
features. Finally, differences between songs charting on the Hot 100 versus the
Global 200 were examined, suggesting that, while there is no significant gender
difference in English, higher English usage may be more critical for success in
the US-focused Hot 100. The findings highlight how linguistic choices in K-pop
lyrics are shaped by global market pressures and reveal stylistic patterns that
reflect performer identity and chart context.

*Stefan Arnold,René Gröbner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates how language models resolve prepositional phrase ambiguity between instrumental and attributive readings, finding Gemma-2 has a 3:4 preference for instrumental interpretations. The researchers identified specific attention heads responsible for this bias and demonstrated control over the distribution by scaling value vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms that resolve the split decision in language models when generating prepositional phrases - specifically whether complements function as instrumental adjuncts (verb modification) or attributive modifiers (noun modification).

Method: Used a prompt suite with ambiguous prepositional phrases, projected activations into vocabulary space to identify attention heads favoring instrumental readings, and scaled value vectors of specific attention heads to control the distribution.

Result: Found a 3:4 preference for instrumental readings. By scaling a single attention head's value vector, successfully shifted the distribution: instrumental complements reduced to 33% while attributive complements increased to 36%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that specific attention heads in language models drive the preference for instrumental interpretations of prepositional phrases, and this bias can be controlled through targeted interventions on value vectors.

Abstract: Language Models, when generating prepositional phrases, must often decide for
whether their complements functions as an instrumental adjunct (describing the
verb adverbially) or an attributive modifier (enriching the noun adjectivally),
yet the internal mechanisms that resolve this split decision remain poorly
understood. In this study, we conduct a targeted investigation into Gemma-2 to
uncover and control the generation of prepositional complements. We assemble a
prompt suite containing with-headed prepositional phrases whose contexts
equally accommodate either an instrumental or attributive continuation,
revealing a strong preference for an instrumental reading at a ratio of 3:4. To
pinpoint individual attention heads that favor instrumental over attributive
complements, we project activations into the vocabulary space. By scaling the
value vector of a single attention head, we can shift the distribution of
functional roles of complements, attenuating instruments to 33% while elevating
attributes to 36%.

TL;DR: PARL-MT is a framework that incorporates progress awareness into LLM training for multi-turn function calling, combining automatic dataset generation with reinforcement learning to improve long-horizon task execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications like travel planning require multi-turn conversations where LLMs need progress awareness to summarize past interactions and plan future actions, but existing approaches either neglect task-level planning or struggle with redundancy in reinforcement learning.

Method: PARL-MT combines Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline to automatically construct datasets with conversation summaries and future planning, and Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) that integrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce redundancy and improve action-task alignment.

Result: Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that PARL-MT significantly outperforms existing methods in multi-turn function calling.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the effectiveness of progress awareness in enabling robust and efficient multi-turn function calling for LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success in single-turn
function calling, yet real-world applications such as travel planning or
multi-stage data analysis typically unfold across multi-turn conversations. In
these settings, LLMs must not only issue accurate function calls at each step
but also maintain progress awareness, the ability to summarize past
interactions and plan future actions to ensure coherent, long-horizon task
execution. Existing approaches, however, either reduce multi-turn training to
isolated single-turn samples, which neglects task-level planning, or employ
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) that struggles with redundancy and lacks
explicit integration of progress awareness. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce PARL-MT, a framework that explicitly incorporates progress awareness
into LLM training for multi-turn function calling. PARL-MT combines (i) a
Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline, which automatically constructs
datasets coupling conversation summaries with future task planning, and (ii) a
Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm, which
integrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce contextual redundancy
and improve alignment between local actions and global task completion.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that PARL-MT
significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of
progress awareness in enabling robust and efficient multi-turn function
calling.

Motivation: To test and evaluate current VLMs' capabilities in generating critiques for traditional Chinese painting, which requires complex semantic understanding.

Method: Developed a quantitative framework by extracting multi-dimensional features from human expert critiques using zero-shot classification, then tested VLMs with persona-guided prompting.

Result: Revealed current performance levels, strengths, and areas for improvement of VLMs in art critique domain.

Conclusion: Provides insights into VLMs' potential and limitations in complex semantic understanding and content generation tasks for art critique.

Abstract: This study aims to test and evaluate the capabilities and characteristics of
current mainstream Visual Language Models (VLMs) in generating critiques for
traditional Chinese painting. To achieve this, we first developed a
quantitative framework for Chinese painting critique. This framework was
constructed by extracting multi-dimensional evaluative features covering
evaluative stance, feature focus, and commentary quality from human expert
critiques using a zero-shot classification model. Based on these features,
several representative critic personas were defined and quantified. This
framework was then employed to evaluate selected VLMs such as Llama, Qwen, or
Gemini. The experimental design involved persona-guided prompting to assess the
VLM's ability to generate critiques from diverse perspectives. Our findings
reveal the current performance levels, strengths, and areas for improvement of
VLMs in the domain of art critique, offering insights into their potential and
limitations in complex semantic understanding and content generation tasks. The

Result: 87.5% of editors reported higher confidence using CLAIRE, identifying 64.7% more inconsistencies. Found at least 3.3% of English Wikipedia facts contradict another, with inconsistencies in 7.3% of FEVEROUS and 4.0% of AmbigQA examples.

Conclusion: Contradictions are a measurable component of Wikipedia, and LLM-based systems like CLAIRE provide practical tools to help editors improve knowledge consistency at scale.

Abstract: Wikipedia is the largest open knowledge corpus, widely used worldwide and
serving as a key resource for training large language models (LLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Ensuring its accuracy is
therefore critical. But how accurate is Wikipedia, and how can we improve it?
  We focus on inconsistencies, a specific type of factual inaccuracy, and
introduce the task of corpus-level inconsistency detection. We present CLAIRE,
an agentic system that combines LLM reasoning with retrieval to surface
potentially inconsistent claims along with contextual evidence for human
review. In a user study with experienced Wikipedia editors, 87.5% reported
higher confidence when using CLAIRE, and participants identified 64.7% more
inconsistencies in the same amount of time.
  Combining CLAIRE with human annotation, we contribute WIKICOLLIDE, the first
benchmark of real Wikipedia inconsistencies. Using random sampling with
CLAIRE-assisted analysis, we find that at least 3.3% of English Wikipedia facts
contradict another fact, with inconsistencies propagating into 7.3% of FEVEROUS
and 4.0% of AmbigQA examples. Benchmarking strong baselines on this dataset
reveals substantial headroom: the best fully automated system achieves an AUROC
of only 75.1%.
  Our results show that contradictions are a measurable component of Wikipedia
and that LLM-based systems like CLAIRE can provide a practical tool to help
editors improve knowledge consistency at scale.

*Soumick Sarker,Abhijit Kumar Rai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fin-ExBERT is a lightweight framework using domain-adapted BERT with LoRA adapters to extract intent-relevant sentences from financial dialogue transcripts through two-stage training and dynamic thresholding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial dialogue transcripts present challenges for information extraction due to informal structure, domain-specific vocabulary, and variable intent density, requiring specialized approaches.

Method: Domain-adapted BERT backbone enhanced with LoRA adapters, two-stage training with progressive unfreezing (classifier head first, then entire model), and dynamic thresholding using probability curvature (elbow detection).

Result: Strong precision and F1 performance on real-world transcripts, with interpretable output suitable for downstream auditing and question-answering workflows.

Conclusion: The framework provides a deployable solution for financial dialogue mining with batched evaluation, visualization, and calibrated export capabilities.

Abstract: Financial dialogue transcripts pose a unique challenge for sentence-level
information extraction due to their informal structure, domain-specific
vocabulary, and variable intent density. We introduce Fin-ExBERT, a lightweight
and modular framework for extracting user intent-relevant sentences from
annotated financial service calls. Our approach builds on a domain-adapted BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) backbone enhanced
with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters, enabling efficient fine-tuning using
limited labeled data. We propose a two-stage training strategy with progressive
unfreezing: initially training a classifier head while freezing the backbone,
followed by gradual fine-tuning of the entire model with differential learning
rates. To ensure robust extraction under uncertainty, we adopt a dynamic
thresholding strategy based on probability curvature (elbow detection),
avoiding fixed cutoff heuristics. Empirical results show strong precision and
F1 performance on real-world transcripts, with interpretable output suitable
for downstream auditing and question-answering workflows. The full framework
supports batched evaluation, visualization, and calibrated export, offering a
deployable solution for financial dialogue mining.

### [402] [A2D: Any-Order, Any-Step Safety Alignment for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23286)
*Wonje Jeung,Sangyeon Yoon,Yoonjun Cho,Dongjae Jeon,Sangwoo Shin,Hyesoo Hong,Albert No*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A2D is a token-level alignment method that defends diffusion LLMs against any-order generation attacks by making them emit [EOS] refusal signals when harmful content appears, achieving near-zero attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion LLMs' any-order generation flexibility creates security vulnerabilities where harmful content can appear at arbitrary positions, and template-based prefilling attacks can bypass response-level refusals.

Method: Token-level alignment using randomized masking to train dLLMs to emit [EOS] refusal signals whenever harmful content arises, enabling real-time monitoring and automatic termination of unsafe continuations.

Result: Reduced DIJA attack success rates from over 80% to near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B), with up to 19.3x faster safe termination through thresholded [EOS] probabilities.

Conclusion: A2D provides robust defense against any-order and any-step prefilling attacks while enabling real-time safety monitoring and early rejection of harmful outputs.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) enable any-order generation, but this
flexibility enlarges the attack surface: harmful spans may appear at arbitrary
positions, and template-based prefilling attacks such as DIJA bypass
response-level refusals. We introduce A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense), a
token-level alignment method that aligns dLLMs to emit an [EOS] refusal signal
whenever harmful content arises. By aligning safety directly at the token-level
under randomized masking, A2D achieves robustness to both any-decoding-order
and any-step prefilling attacks under various conditions. It also enables
real-time monitoring: dLLMs may begin a response but automatically terminate if
unsafe continuation emerges. On safety benchmarks, A2D consistently prevents
the generation of harmful outputs, slashing DIJA success rates from over 80% to
near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B), and
thresholded [EOS] probabilities allow early rejection, yielding up to 19.3x
faster safe termination.

### [403] [Scaling Policy Compliance Assessment in Language Models with Policy Reasoning Traces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23291)
*Joseph Marvin Imperial,Harish Tayyar Madabushi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Policy Reasoning Traces (PRT) are specialized reasoning chains that improve LLMs' policy compliance assessment capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results on HIPAA and GDPR policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human experts perform policy compliance assessment through systematic reasoning processes, but documenting these gold-standard reasoning processes is costly to acquire.

Method: Introduce Policy Reasoning Traces (PRT) as specialized generated reasoning chains that serve as a reasoning bridge to enhance LLMs' policy compliance assessment capabilities.

Result: PRTs significantly improve performance of both open-weight and commercial models in policy compliance assessment, setting new state-of-the-art for HIPAA and GDPR policies. They also improve accurate citation of policy clauses and influence compliance decisions through high utilization from raw chains of thought.

Conclusion: Policy Reasoning Traces effectively enhance LLMs' policy compliance assessment capabilities, providing both accuracy gains and improved reasoning transparency.

Abstract: Policy compliance assessment is a fundamental task of evaluating whether an
input case strictly complies with a set of human-defined rules, more generally
known as policies. In practice, human experts follow a systematic, step-by-step
process to identify violations with respect to specific stipulations outlined
in the policy. However, such documentation of gold-standard, expert-level
reasoning processes is costly to acquire. In this paper, we introduce Policy
Reasoning Traces (PRT), a form of specialized generated reasoning chains that
serve as a reasoning bridge to improve an LLM's policy compliance assessment
capabilities. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the use of PRTs for
both inference-time and training-time scenarios significantly enhances the
performance of open-weight and commercial models, setting a new
state-of-the-art for HIPAA and GDPR policies. Beyond accuracy gains, we also
highlight how PRTs can improve an LLM's ability to accurately cite policy
clauses, as well as influence compliance decisions through their high
utilization from the raw chains of thought.

### [404] [Learning to Reason in Structured In-context Environments with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23330)
*Peng Yu,Zeyuan Zhao,Shao Zhang,Luoyi Fu,Xinbing Wang,Ying Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIE (Structured In-context Environment), a framework that automatically creates scalable reasoning environments from structured data to improve LLM reasoning skills through reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning environments have limitations - mathematical/coding environments are hard to scale due to expert annotation requirements, while game-based environments produce specialized skills that don't generalize well. An ideal environment needs scalability, generalizable reasoning, and verifiability.

Method: SIE framework automatically constructs reasoning environments from large-scale structured data. It leverages the rich compositional patterns in structured data to support generalizable reasoning, and uses explicit schemas and reasoning chains for rule-based verifiability.

Result: SIE achieves substantial improvements in in-domain structured reasoning and enables learned compositional reasoning skills to effectively generalize to out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Even in information-limited partial SIEs, LLMs can infer missing information through environment exploration.

Conclusion: SIE provides a scalable framework for improving LLM reasoning capabilities that supports generalization across domains and maintains verifiability through structured data properties.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL) via environmental
exploration. As the intrinsic properties of the environment determine the
abilities that LLMs can learn, the environment plays a important role in the RL
finetuning process. An ideal LLM reasoning environment should possess three
core characteristics: scalability, generalizable reasoning, and verifiability.
However, existing mathematical and coding environments are difficult to scale
due to heavy reliance on expert annotation, while the skills learned in
game-based environments are too specialized to generalize. To bridge this gap,
we introduce the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{E}nvironment
(SIE) framework. SIE achieves scalability by automatically constructing
reasoning environments from large-scale structured data, where the rich
compositional patterns naturally support generalizable reasoning. Moreover, the
explicit schemas and reasoning chains in structured data provide a foundation
for rule-based verifiability. Experimental results show that SIE framework not
only achieves substantial improvements in in-domain structured reasoning, but
also enables the learned compositional reasoning skills to generalize
effectively to out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. We
further explored learning in information-limited partial SIEs and found that
LLMs can infer the missing information through exploring the environment,
leading to robust reasoning improvements and generalization performance.

### [405] [C-Evolve: Consensus-based Evolution for Prompt Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23331)
*Tiancheng Li,Yuhang Wang,Zhiyang Chen,Zijun Wang,Liyuan Ma,Guo-jun Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C-Evolve is an evolutionary algorithm that discovers groups of prompts whose aggregated outputs via majority voting achieve optimal performance, outperforming single-prompt evolution methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few works explore whether aggregating results from multiple prompts to reach consensus can further advance AI system capabilities beyond single-prompt evolution methods.

Method: Uses island-based evolutionary algorithm to maintain population diversity, forms groups from prompts across islands, and evaluates individual prompts based on their voting score contribution within groups rather than individual performance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: 70.67% on HotpotQA and 43.88% on IFBench with Qwen3-8B (4.95% and 2.73% higher than GEPA), and 47.96% on IFBench and 95.33% on MATH with GPT-4.1-mini.

Conclusion: C-Evolve demonstrates competitive performance by evolving prompts that work well together in groups rather than individually, gradually improving group performance through consensus.

Abstract: Prompt evolution algorithms offer a powerful paradigm for enhancing AI
systems based on closed-source models, while few work explores whether
aggregating results from multiple prompts to reach a consensus can further
advance the system capability boundary. In this paper, we introduce
Consensus-Evolve (C-Evolve), an evolutionary algorithm that discovers a group
of prompts whose aggregated outputs after majority voting achieve optimal
performance. More specifically, C-Evolve employs an island-based evolutionary
algorithm to maintain population diversity, and prompts from distinct islands
are selected to form groups to aggregate their outputs. The key difference from
single individual evolution is a voting score, which evaluates each individual
prompt's contribution within groups. We take this as the fitness score for
evolution instead of individual performance. Consequently, C-Evolve is more
likely to produce and maintain prompts with higher potential to form a
high-performing group and eliminate low-performing ones, gradually improving
the group performance after reaching consensus. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks, including both
open-ended tasks like HotpotQA and closed-ended tasks like MATH. On Qwen3-8B,
C-Evolve achieves 70.67% on HotpotQA and 43.88% on IFBench, which are 4.95% and
2.73% higher than GEPA, respectively. For GPT-4.1-mini, the accuracy on IFBench
is further improved to 47.96% and reaches 95.33% in the MATH benchmark. These
results demonstrate the C-Evolve's competitive performance.

### [406] [Dual-Space Smoothness for Robust and Balanced LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23362)
*Han Yan,Zheyuan Liu,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM is a unified framework for machine unlearning that enforces dual-space smoothness in representation and parameter spaces to improve robustness against attacks and balance unlearning metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in machine unlearning including catastrophic forgetting, metric imbalance, and vulnerability to relearn/jailbreak attacks that plague current state-of-the-art methods.

Method: Two-stage smoothness optimization: (1) representation space stage with robustly trained probe for jailbreak defense, (2) parameter-space stage that decouples retain-forget gradient conflicts and smooths parameter space.

Result: Outperforms SOTA baselines on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks across conversational-dialogue and continuous-text settings, achieving better metric balance and robustness under multiple attacks.

Conclusion: PRISM effectively addresses key challenges in machine unlearning through dual-space smoothness enforcement, providing improved robustness and balanced performance across multiple metrics.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models, Machine Unlearning has
emerged to address growing concerns around user privacy, copyright
infringement, and overall safety. Yet state-of-the-art (SOTA) unlearning
methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and metric imbalance, for
example by over-optimizing one objective (e.g., unlearning effectiveness,
utility preservation, or privacy protection) at the expense of others. In
addition, small perturbations in the representation or parameter space can be
exploited by relearn and jailbreak attacks. To address these challenges, we
propose PRISM, a unified framework that enforces dual-space smoothness in
representation and parameter spaces to improve robustness and balance
unlearning metrics. PRISM consists of two smoothness optimization stages: (i) a
representation space stage that employs a robustly trained probe to defend
against jailbreak attacks, and (ii) a parameter-space stage that decouples
retain-forget gradient conflicts, reduces imbalance, and smooths the parameter
space to mitigate relearning attacks. Extensive experiments on WMDP and MUSE,
across conversational-dialogue and continuous-text settings, show that PRISM
outperforms SOTA baselines under multiple attacks while achieving a better
balance among key metrics.

### [407] [MedCritical: Enhancing Medical Reasoning in Small Language Models via Self-Collaborative Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23368)
*Xinchun Su,Chunxu Luo,Yixuan Li,Weidong Yang,Lipeng Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedCritical is a two-stage framework that enables small language models to achieve complex medical reasoning through self-iteration and direct preference optimization, outperforming existing 7B models on medical benchmarks at lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models underperform in complex medical reasoning tasks compared to large models, and traditional knowledge distillation methods are costly and inefficient due to reliance on teacher models for error correction.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) Extract thought templates from teacher model to guide student model, (2) Use direct preference optimization through model self-iteration where student plays against its own correction trajectory to enhance reasoning.

Result: MedCritical 7B model outperforms Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B models by 3.04% and 10.12% respectively on CMExam benchmark, achieving new SOTA performance among 7B-class small models.

Conclusion: The proposed self-learning DPO approach enables small models to achieve comparable results to traditional knowledge distillation at lower cost, demonstrating effective medical reasoning capability through error-driven insights.

Abstract: In the field of medicine, complex reasoning tasks such as clinical diagnosis,
treatment planning, and medical knowledge integration pose significant
challenges, where small language models often underperform compared to large
language models like GPT-4 and Deepseek. Recent knowledge distillation-based
methods aim to address these issues through teacher-guided error correction,
but this LLM as judge approach remains challenging in terms of cost, time, and
efficiency. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel two-stage framework,
MedCritical, which uses a small language model fine-tuned by a large teacher
model to play against itself. In the first stage, we extract high-level and
detailed long-chain thought templates from the teacher model to guide the
student model to generate more complex reasoning thoughts. In the second stage,
we introduce direct preference optimization (DPO) through model self-iteration
collaboration to enhance the reasoning ability of the student model by playing
against the correction trajectory of the fine-tuned model during training. This
model self-learning DPO approach teaches the student model to use its own
error-driven insights to consolidate its skills and knowledge to solve complex
problems, and achieves comparable results to traditional knowledge distillation
methods using teacher models at a lower cost. Notably, our MedCritical 7B model
outperforms the Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B models by 3.04\% and 10.12\%
respectively on the CMExam benchmark, achieving new SOTA performance among
7B-class small models.

*Junming Yang,Ning Xu,Biao Liu,Shiqi Qiao,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MetaAPO is a novel preference optimization framework that dynamically couples data generation with model training using a meta-learner to estimate alignment gaps and balance online/offline data quality and distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and evolving model policy in LLM alignment, overcoming limitations of static heuristics and decoupled online sampling strategies.

Method: Uses lightweight meta-learner as "alignment gap estimator" to evaluate benefits of on-policy sampling, guides targeted online generation, and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to balance online/offline data quality and distribution.

Result: Outperforms existing preference optimization approaches on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench across various settings, while reducing 42% in online annotation costs.

Conclusion: MetaAPO effectively bridges the distribution gap in preference optimization through dynamic coupling of data generation and training, achieving superior performance with reduced annotation costs.

Abstract: Preference optimization is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human values and intentions. A significant challenge in this process is
the distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the
evolving model policy. Existing methods attempt to reduce this gap using static
heuristics or decoupled online sampling strategies, but they often fail to
adapt to the model's dynamic learning state. To bridge this gap, we propose
Meta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), a novel framework
that dynamically couples data generation with model training. MetaAPO employs a
lightweight meta-learner, as an "alignment gap estimator", to evaluate the
potential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data. This
guides targeted online generation and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to the
optimization objective, dynamically balancing the quality and distribution of
online and offline data. Experiments on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench
demonstrate that MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference
optimization approaches across various settings, while reducing 42% in online
annotation costs.

*Xi Zhang,Zaiqiao Meng,Jake Lever,Edmond S. L. Ho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CCD is a training-free framework that reduces medical hallucinations in radiology MLLMs by integrating clinical signals from expert models through dual-stage contrastive decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs in radiology often generate clinically unsupported descriptions (medical hallucinations) due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections, posing serious risks in medical applications requiring accuracy.

Method: Clinical Contrastive Decoding (CCD) integrates structured clinical signals from task-specific radiology expert models using a dual-stage contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, without modifying the base MLLM.

Result: CCD consistently improves radiology report generation performance across three datasets and multiple models, achieving up to 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 on MIMIC-CXR dataset with state-of-the-art RRG models.

Conclusion: CCD provides a lightweight and generalizable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language
understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported
descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in
medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through
empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent
in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To
address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free
and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical
signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage
contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby
enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on
three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves
overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR
dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to
state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and
generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively
bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Guard Vector is a safety task vector created from parameter differences between guardrail and pretrained language models. When composed with target models, it creates Target Guard Models that improve safety classification, enable multilingual support without training, and work across different model architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient and flexible approach to AI safety that reduces data and compute requirements while enabling multilingual support and model portability without additional training.

Method: Compute Guard Vector as parameter difference between guardrail and pretrained models, compose with target models to create TGMs, use prefix-based training with streaming-aware approach and single-token output classifier.

Result: TGMs improve classification quality across safety suites, enable language extensibility to Chinese, Japanese, Korean without training, demonstrate portability across Llama and Gemma backbones, preserve quality under streaming, and increase throughput with reduced latency.

Conclusion: The approach reduces data and compute requirements while promoting streaming-aware evaluation, contributing to more responsible AI ecosystem through efficient safety mechanisms.

Abstract: We introduce Guard Vector, a safety task vector computed as the parameter
difference between a guardrail model (Guard Model) and a same-architecture
pretrained language model. Composing this vector with a target language model
yields a Target Guard Model (TGM). We then adapt TGM with a streaming-aware
approach that combines prefix-based training and evaluation with a classifier
that produces a single-token output. With this composition alone, TGM improves
classification quality over established Guard Models across standard safety
suites and enables language extensibility to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean,
requiring neither additional training nor target language labels. It also
demonstrates model portability across two widely used public guardrail
backbones, Llama and Gemma. With prefix SFT (supervised fine-tuning), TGM
preserves classification quality under streaming by aligning the behavior
between prefix inputs and full-text inputs. The single-token output design
increases throughput and reduces latency. Together, these components reduce
data and compute requirements while promoting streaming-aware evaluation
practices, thereby contributing to a more responsible AI ecosystem.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes conducting multiple pretraining experiments simultaneously in a single training run to reduce computational costs while enabling rigorous scientific experimentation with large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational cost of pretraining large language models presents a significant constraint for controlled experiments, limiting scientific understanding of learning, reasoning, and memorization.

Method: Conduct ten different experiments simultaneously during training of a 1.5B parameter model on 210B tokens, testing for interactions between experiments through continual pretraining.

Result: Successfully replicated results from previous works on data contamination, poisoning, and memorization, while also conducting novel investigations into knowledge acquisition, mathematical reasoning, and watermarking with minimal impact on training dynamics and overall performance.

Conclusion: Multiple pretraining experiments can be performed simultaneously in a single training run, enabling rigorous scientific experimentation with large models on a limited compute budget, with negligible interactions between experiments.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that controlled pretraining experiments are a
powerful tool for understanding learning, reasoning, and memorization in large
language models (LLMs). However, the computational cost of pretraining presents
a significant constraint. To overcome this constraint, we propose to conduct
multiple pretraining experiments simultaneously during a single training run.
We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by conducting ten experiments
during the training of a 1.5B parameter model on 210B tokens. Although we only
train a single model, we can replicate the results from multiple previous works
on data contamination, poisoning, and memorization. We also conduct novel
investigations into knowledge acquisition, mathematical reasoning, and
watermarking. For example, we dynamically update the training data until the
model acquires a particular piece of knowledge. Remarkably, the influence of
the ten experiments on the model's training dynamics and overall performance is
minimal. However, interactions between different experiments may act as a
potential confounder in our approach. We propose to test for interactions with
continual pretraining experiments, finding them to be negligible in our setup.
Overall, our findings suggest that performing multiple pretraining experiments
in a single training run can enable rigorous scientific experimentation with
large models on a compute budget.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRACE is a prompt optimization framework that uses gated refinement and adaptive compression strategies to efficiently generate improved prompts for LLMs, achieving significant performance gains with only 25% of the computational budget of prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic prompt optimization methods struggle with stable prompt generation, low efficiency, and getting trapped in local optima, making scalable prompt engineering challenging.

Method: GRACE integrates two strategies: gated refinement (using feedback regulation and update rejection gates to refine update signals) and adaptive compression (distilling core concepts when optimization stagnates to restructure the optimization trace).

Result: GRACE achieved average relative performance improvements of 4.7%, 4.4% and 2.7% over state-of-the-art methods on 11 tasks across BIG-Bench Hard, domain-specific, and general NLP tasks, using only 25% of the prompt generation budget.

Conclusion: GRACE delivers substantial performance and efficiency gains in prompt optimization through strategic information loss via refinement and compression, making it a highly efficient framework for LLM prompt engineering.

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for leveraging the full potential of large
language models (LLMs). While automatic prompt optimization offers a scalable
alternative to costly manual design, generating effective prompts remains
challenging. Existing methods often struggle to stably generate improved
prompts, leading to low efficiency, and overlook that prompt optimization
easily gets trapped in local optima. Addressing this, we propose GRACE, a
framework that integrates two synergistic strategies: Gated Refinement and
Adaptive Compression, achieving Efficient prompt optimization. The gated
refinement strategy introduces a feedback regulation gate and an update
rejection gate, which refine update signals to produce stable and effective
prompt improvements. When optimization stagnates, the adaptive compression
strategy distills the prompt's core concepts, restructuring the optimization
trace and opening new paths. By strategically introducing information loss
through refinement and compression, GRACE delivers substantial gains in
performance and efficiency. In extensive experiments on 11 tasks across three
practical domains, including BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), domain-specific, and general
NLP tasks, GRACE achieves significant average relative performance improvements
of 4.7%, 4.4% and 2.7% over state-of-the-art methods, respectively. Further
analysis shows that GRACE achieves these gains using only 25% of the prompt
generation budget required by prior methods, highlighting its high optimization
efficiency and low computational overhead. Our code is available at

*Sherrie Shen,Weixuan Wang,Alexandra Birch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces paratextual explicitation for machine translation, formalizing Genette's theory to address culture-bound terms through footnotes and endnotes, evaluating LLMs on this task using expert-aligned paratexts from English translations of Liaozhai.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Faithful translation of culture-bound terms remains challenging for MT, with existing approaches focusing only on in-text solutions while overlooking professional translators' use of paratextual apparatus like footnotes and endnotes.

Method: Formalized Genette's theory of paratexts, constructed a dataset of 560 expert-aligned paratexts from four English translations of Liaozhai, and evaluated LLMs with/without reasoning traces on choice and content of explicitation using intrinsic prompting and agentic retrieval methods.

Result: LLM-generated paratexts improve audience comprehension but remain less effective than translator-authored ones. Statistical analysis shows professional translators vary widely in paratext usage, indicating cultural mediation is open-ended rather than prescriptive.

Conclusion: Paratextual explicitation shows potential for advancing MT beyond linguistic equivalence, with promising extensions to monolingual explanation and personalized adaptation.

Abstract: The faithful transfer of contextually-embedded meaning continues to challenge
contemporary machine translation (MT), particularly in the rendering of
culture-bound terms--expressions or concepts rooted in specific languages or
cultures, resisting direct linguistic transfer. Existing computational
approaches to explicitating these terms have focused exclusively on in-text
solutions, overlooking paratextual apparatus in the footnotes and endnotes
employed by professional translators. In this paper, we formalize Genette's
(1987) theory of paratexts from literary and translation studies to introduce
the task of paratextual explicitation for MT. We construct a dataset of 560
expert-aligned paratexts from four English translations of the classical
Chinese short story collection Liaozhai and evaluate LLMs with and without
reasoning traces on choice and content of explicitation. Experiments across
intrinsic prompting and agentic retrieval methods establish the difficulty of
this task, with human evaluation showing that LLM-generated paratexts improve
audience comprehension, though remain considerably less effective than
translator-authored ones. Beyond model performance, statistical analysis
reveals that even professional translators vary widely in their use of
paratexts, suggesting that cultural mediation is inherently open-ended rather
than prescriptive. Our findings demonstrate the potential of paratextual
explicitation in advancing MT beyond linguistic equivalence, with promising
extensions to monolingual explanation and personalized adaptation.

### [414] [Comparison of Scoring Rationales Between Large Language Models and Human Raters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23412)
*Haowei Hua,Hong Jiao,Dan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study compares human and LLM (GPT-4o, Gemini, etc.) essay scoring rationales to understand scoring inconsistencies and improve automated scoring systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With advances in LLMs, there's growing interest in using them for automated scoring. Since LLMs can provide rationales for their scores, comparing human and LLM reasoning can help understand scoring inconsistencies and improve automated scoring systems.

Method: Used essays from large-scale tests, evaluated LLM scoring accuracy using quadratic weighted kappa and normalized mutual information, compared rationale similarity using cosine similarity, and analyzed clustering patterns with principal component analysis on rationale embeddings.

Result: The study provides insights into LLM scoring accuracy and the "thinking" processes behind both human and LLM-based automated scoring systems.

Conclusion: Analyzing rationales from both human and LLM raters helps identify causes of scoring inconsistency and improves understanding of automated scoring systems, potentially leading to more reliable scoring methods.

Abstract: Advances in automated scoring are closely aligned with advances in
machine-learning and natural-language-processing techniques. With recent
progress in large language models (LLMs), the use of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude,
and other generative-AI chatbots for automated scoring has been explored. Given
their strong reasoning capabilities, LLMs can also produce rationales to
support the scores they assign. Thus, evaluating the rationales provided by
both human and LLM raters can help improve the understanding of the reasoning
that each type of rater applies when assigning a score. This study investigates
the rationales of human and LLM raters to identify potential causes of scoring
inconsistency. Using essays from a large-scale test, the scoring accuracy of
GPT-4o, Gemini, and other LLMs is examined based on quadratic weighted kappa
and normalized mutual information. Cosine similarity is used to evaluate the
similarity of the rationales provided. In addition, clustering patterns in
rationales are explored using principal component analysis based on the
embeddings of the rationales. The findings of this study provide insights into
the accuracy and ``thinking'' of LLMs in automated scoring, helping to improve
the understanding of the rationales behind both human scoring and LLM-based
automated scoring.

*Rajaa El Hamdani,Samy Haffoudhi,Nils Holzenberger,Fabian Suchanek,Thomas Bonald,Fragkiskos D. Malliaros*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models have more factual knowledge than standard evaluation shows. Retrieval-Constrained Decoding (RCD) reveals this by restricting outputs to unique surface forms, significantly improving performance on the YAGO-QA dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard evaluations often dismiss correct answers from language models because they appear in alternative surface forms, leading to underestimation of models' actual parametric knowledge.

Method: Proposed Retrieval-Constrained Decoding (RCD) - a decoding strategy that restricts model outputs to unique surface forms to ensure correct answers aren't missed due to surface form variations.

Result: RCD significantly improves performance: Llama-3.1-70B went from 32.3% F1 with vanilla decoding to 46.0% with RCD. Llama-3.1-8B reached 33.0% with RCD, outperforming the larger model under standard decoding.

Conclusion: Language models possess more factual knowledge than standard evaluations suggest, and RCD effectively reveals this hidden knowledge by accounting for surface form variations in answers.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) encode substantial factual knowledge, but often produce
answers judged as incorrect. We hypothesize that many of these answers are
actually correct, but are expressed in alternative surface forms that are
dismissed due to an overly strict evaluation, leading to an underestimation of
models' parametric knowledge. We propose Retrieval-Constrained Decoding (RCD),
a decoding strategy that restricts model outputs to unique surface forms. We
introduce YAGO-QA, a dataset of 19,137 general knowledge questions. Evaluating
open-source LMs from 135M to 70B parameters, we show that standard decoding
undervalues their knowledge. For instance, Llama-3.1-70B scores only 32.3% F1
with vanilla decoding but 46.0% with RCD. Similarly, Llama-3.1-8B reaches 33.0%
with RCD, outperforming the larger model under vanilla decoding. We publicly
share the code and dataset at https://github.com/Rajjaa/disambiguated-LLM.

*Xuanming Zhang,Yuxuan Chen,Min-Hsuan Yeh,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CooT is a decoding-time framework that adds explicit cognitive self-monitoring to LLMs, using a Perceiver to detect misalignments and regenerate responses when violations occur, making alignment dynamic and auditable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment strategies embed safety into model weights, making controls implicit, static, and difficult to modify. There's a need for more explicit, dynamic alignment processes.

Method: CooT couples a standard text Generator with a cognitive Perceiver that monitors generation using a precedence-based hierarchy of principles. When violations are detected, it rolls back generation and regenerates with injected guidance combining universal social priors and context-specific warnings.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families confirm that CooT consistently improves safety and social reasoning performance.

Conclusion: CooT transforms alignment from a fixed property into an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process active during inference, allowing flexible policy updates without retraining.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but can still exhibit
harmful behaviors. Current alignment strategies typically embed safety into
model weights, making these controls implicit, static, and difficult to modify.
This paper introduces Cognition-of-Thought (CooT), a novel decoding-time
framework that equips LLMs with an explicit cognitive self-monitoring loop.
CooT couples a standard text Generator with a cognitive Perceiver that
continuously monitors the unfolding sequence. The Perceiver uses a structured,
precedence-based hierarchy of principles (e.g., safety over obedience) to
detect potential misalignments as they arise. When violations are flagged, CooT
intervenes by rolling back the generation to the point of error and
regenerating under injected guidance that combines universal social priors with
context-specific warnings. CooT thus transforms alignment from a fixed property
into an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process active during inference,
allowing for flexible policy updates without retraining the model. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families confirm that CooT
consistently improves safety and social reasoning performance.

### [417] [Text-Based Approaches to Item Difficulty Modeling in Large-Scale Assessments: A Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23486)
*Sydney Peters,Nan Zhang,Hong Jiao,Ming Li,Tianyi Zhou,Robert Lissitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reviews 37 studies on automated item difficulty prediction using text-based machine learning approaches, showing that transformer-based language models can effectively predict item difficulty without manual feature engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional item difficulty modeling through field testing and classical methods is time-consuming and costly. Text-based machine learning approaches offer promising alternatives for more efficient assessment development.

Method: Systematic review of 37 articles analyzing dataset characteristics, difficulty parameters, subject domains, item types, and model architectures including classic ML and transformer-based language models.

Result: Text-based methods can predict item difficulty with RMSE as low as 0.165, Pearson correlation up to 0.87, and accuracy up to 0.806. Transformer models capture syntactic and semantic patterns without manual feature engineering.

Conclusion: Automated text-based methods show strong potential for item difficulty prediction, with performance benchmarks established for future research. The review discusses practical implications and future research directions.

Abstract: Item difficulty plays a crucial role in test performance, interpretability of
scores, and equity for all test-takers, especially in large-scale assessments.
Traditional approaches to item difficulty modeling rely on field testing and
classical test theory (CTT)-based item analysis or item response theory (IRT)
calibration, which can be time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, text-based approaches leveraging machine learning and language
models, have emerged as promising alternatives. This paper reviews and
synthesizes 37 articles on automated item difficulty prediction in large-scale
assessment settings published through May 2025. For each study, we delineate
the dataset, difficulty parameter, subject domain, item type, number of items,
training and test data split, input, features, model, evaluation criteria, and
model performance outcomes. Results showed that although classic machine
learning models remain relevant due to their interpretability, state-of-the-art
language models, using both small and large transformer-based architectures,
can capture syntactic and semantic patterns without the need for manual feature
engineering. Uniquely, model performance outcomes were summarized to serve as a
benchmark for future research and overall, text-based methods have the
potential to predict item difficulty with root mean square error (RMSE) as low
as 0.165, Pearson correlation as high as 0.87, and accuracy as high as 0.806.
The review concludes by discussing implications for practice and outlining
future research directions for automated item difficulty modeling.

Conclusion: Role design in prompts is an important factor that can improve LLM capabilities in in-context learning scenarios, warranting further exploration in prompt engineering.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
predictions based on prompts without additional fine-tuning. While prompt
engineering has been widely studied, the impact of role design within prompts
remains underexplored. This study examines the influence of role configurations
in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o from
OpenAI and Llama2-7b and Llama2-13b from Meta. We evaluate the models'
performance across datasets, focusing on tasks like sentiment analysis, text
classification, question answering, and math reasoning. Our findings suggest
the potential of role-based prompt structuring to enhance LLM performance.

*Dania Refai,Alaa Dalaq,Doaa Dalaq,Irfan Ahmad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Active learning framework for Arabic sentiment analysis reduces annotation costs using LLM-assisted labeling, achieving competitive performance to human labeling across multiple datasets and deep learning architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited progress in Arabic sentiment analysis due to lack of large labeled datasets, with few studies exploring active learning and LLM-assisted annotation in Arabic context.

Method: Proposed active learning framework using LSTM, GRU, and RNN architectures across three Arabic datasets, comparing human labeling vs LLM-assisted labeling with GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek Chat, and LLaMA 3 70B Instruct.

Result: LLM-assisted active learning achieves competitive or superior performance: LSTM with GPT-4o reached 93% accuracy on Hunger Station with only 450 samples, DeepSeek Chat achieved 82% accuracy on MASAC with 650 samples matching human labeling performance.

Conclusion: LLM-assisted active learning is effective for Arabic sentiment analysis, significantly reducing annotation costs while maintaining high accuracy across different datasets and model architectures.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP), particularly sentiment analysis, plays a
vital role in areas like marketing, customer service, and social media
monitoring by providing insights into user opinions and emotions. However,
progress in Arabic sentiment analysis remains limited due to the lack of large,
high-quality labeled datasets. While active learning has proven effective in
reducing annotation efforts in other languages, few studies have explored it in
Arabic sentiment tasks. Likewise, the use of large language models (LLMs) for
assisting annotation and comparing their performance to human labeling is still
largely unexplored in the Arabic context. In this paper, we propose an active
learning framework for Arabic sentiment analysis designed to reduce annotation
costs while maintaining high performance. We evaluate multiple deep learning
architectures: Specifically, long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent
units (GRU), and recurrent neural networks (RNN), across three benchmark
datasets: Hunger Station, AJGT, and MASAC, encompassing both modern standard
Arabic and dialectal variations. Additionally, two annotation strategies are
compared: Human labeling and LLM-assisted labeling. Five LLMs are evaluated as
annotators: GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek Chat, and LLaMA 3
70B Instruct. For each dataset, the best-performing LLM was used: GPT-4o for
Hunger Station, Claude 3 Sonnet for AJGT, and DeepSeek Chat for MASAC. Our
results show that LLM-assisted active learning achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to human labeling. For example, on the Hunger Station
dataset, the LSTM model achieved 93% accuracy with only 450 labeled samples
using GPT-4o-generated labels, while on the MASAC dataset, DeepSeek Chat
reached 82% accuracy with 650 labeled samples, matching the accuracy obtained
through human labeling.

### [421] [On the Shelf Life of Fine-Tuned LLM Judges: Future Proofing, Backward Compatibility, and Question Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23542)
*Janvijay Singh,Austin Xu,Yilun Zhou,Yefan Zhou,Dilek Hakkani-Tur,Shafiq Joty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes practical deployment concerns for finetuned LLM judges, focusing on future-proofing, backward compatibility, and question generalization in the math domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard evaluation ignores practical deployment concerns for finetuned judges, particularly their ability to handle future models, past models, and unseen questions.

Method: Study three aspects (future-proofing, backward compatibility, question generalization) in math domain using unified framework with varying train/test distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms, and three base models.

Result: Future-proofing is challenging for most models, backward compatibility is relatively easy (DPO-trained models improve performance), continual learning provides balanced adaptation, and all models show performance degradation on unseen questions.

Conclusion: Current judges don't fully generalize to unseen questions, and continual learning offers better adaptation to distribution shifts between older and newer responses, providing practical insights for judge model deployment.

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is widely used in both evaluating free-text model
responses and reward modeling for model alignment and finetuning. Recently,
finetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred
choice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former
achieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to
common biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical
concerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this
paper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of
these judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges
finetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by
future models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well
judges generalize to unseen questions at test time. We study these three
aspects in the math domain under a unified framework with varying train and
test distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms and three
different base models. Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging
for most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with
DPO-trained models consistently improving performance. We further find that
continual learning provides a more balanced adaptation to shifts between older
and newer response distributions than training solely on stronger or weaker
responses. Moreover, all models observe certain degrees of performance
degradation when moving from questions seen during training to unseen ones,
showing that current judges do not fully generalize to unseen questions. These
findings provide insights into practical considerations for developing and
deploying judge models in the face of ever-changing generators.

TL;DR: MoRSD improves Chain-of-Thought distillation by selecting high-quality rationales using a Rationale Difficulty metric, achieving 4.6% average improvement on seven datasets with fewer but better rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoT distillation methods focus on data quantity over quality, potentially transferring noisy or incorrect reasoning to student models.

Method: Proposed Model-Oriented Rationale Selection Distillation (MoRSD) with Rationale Difficulty metric to select high-quality rationales based on accuracy, diversity, and difficulty.

Result: Achieved 4.6% average improvement on seven datasets across three tasks using fewer rationales, showing that small portions of high-quality rationales outperform entire datasets.

Conclusion: MoRSD provides an efficient solution for CoT distillation by emphasizing rationale quality over quantity, enhancing student models' reasoning abilities with carefully selected rationales.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation aims to enhance small language models'
(SLMs) reasoning by transferring multi-step reasoning capability from the
larger teacher models. However, existing work underestimates rationale quality,
focusing primarily on data quantity, which may transfer noisy or incorrect
information to the student model. To address the above issues, we proposed
\textbf{M}odel-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}ationale \textbf{S}election
\textbf{D}istillation (MoRSD), which can discern and select high quality
rationales for distillation to improve performance further. We further propose
a Rationale Difficulty (RD) metric to measure the ability of the student model
to generate the correct answer under a given rationale. Compared to the
baseline, we achieved 4.6$\%$ average improvement on seven datasets over three
tasks, using fewer rationales by controlling their accuracy, diversity, and
difficulty. Our results reveal that a small portion of the high quality
rationales can enhance the reasoning ability of student models than the entire
dataset. Our method promises to be a possible solution for efficient CoT
distillation. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MoRSD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Jackal is a large-scale benchmark for mapping natural language queries to Jira Query Language (JQL), featuring 100,000 NL-JQL pairs with execution-based validation on a live Jira instance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no existing open, real-world, execution-based benchmark for converting natural language to JQL, despite enterprise teams' reliance on JQL for issue retrieval in Jira.

Method: Created Jackal benchmark with 100,000 NL-JQL pairs validated on a live Jira instance with 200,000+ issues, covering four user request types: Long NL, Short NL, Semantically Similar, and Semantically Exact.

Result: Best model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieved only 60.3% execution accuracy on Jackal-5K subset, with performance varying significantly across request types: Long NL (86.0%), Short NL (35.7%), Semantically Similar (22.7%), Semantically Exact (99.3%).

Conclusion: Jackal exposes limitations of current LLMs in text-to-JQL conversion and sets a new execution-based challenge for enterprise data research.

Abstract: Enterprise teams rely on the Jira Query Language (JQL) to retrieve and filter
issues from Jira. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no open, real-world,
execution-based benchmark for mapping natural language queries to JQL. We
introduce Jackal, a novel, large-scale text-to-JQL benchmark comprising 100,000
natural language (NL) requests paired with validated JQL queries and
execution-based results on a live Jira instance with over 200,000 issues. To
reflect real-world usage, each JQL query is associated with four types of user
requests: (i) Long NL, (ii) Short NL, (iii) Semantically Similar, and (iv)
Semantically Exact. We release Jackal, a corpus of 100,000 text-to-JQL pairs,
together with an execution-based scoring toolkit, and a static snapshot of the
evaluated Jira instance for reproducibility. We report text-to-JQL results on
23 Large Language Models (LLMs) spanning parameter sizes, open and closed
source models, across execution accuracy, exact match, and canonical exact
match. In this paper, we report results on Jackal-5K, a 5,000-pair subset of
Jackal. On Jackal-5K, the best overall model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieves only
60.3% execution accuracy averaged equally across four user request types.
Performance varies significantly across user request types: (i) Long NL
(86.0%), (ii) Short NL (35.7%), (iii) Semantically Similar (22.7%), and (iv)
Semantically Exact (99.3%). By benchmarking LLMs on their ability to produce
correct and executable JQL queries, Jackal exposes the limitations of current
state-of-the-art LLMs and sets a new, execution-based challenge for future
research in Jira enterprise data.

*JinXin Li,Gang Tu,JunJie Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HSAD: A hallucination detection method using frequency-domain analysis of hidden layer temporal signals to identify reasoning anomalies in LLMs, overcoming limitations of knowledge coverage and static feature approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hallucination detection methods are limited by knowledge coverage constraints (factual consistency verification) and inability to capture reasoning biases (static hidden layer features), which hinders LLM deployment in critical applications.

Method: Model LLM reasoning as a cognitive journey, analyze hidden layer temporal signals using Fast Fourier Transform to extract spectral features that capture reasoning anomalies, then design detection algorithm based on these features.

Result: HSAD demonstrates higher detection accuracy and robustness by effectively combining reasoning process modeling with frequency-domain feature extraction, overcoming limitations of existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed HSAD method provides an effective solution for hallucination detection that captures reasoning biases during inference, making it suitable for critical application scenarios where reliable LLM outputs are essential.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in a
wide range of tasks such as language understanding and code generation, the
frequent occurrence of hallucinations during the generation process has become
a significant impediment to their deployment in critical application scenarios.
Current mainstream hallucination detection methods rely on factual consistency
verification or static hidden layer features. The former is constrained by the
scope of knowledge coverage, while the latter struggles to capture reasoning
biases during the inference process. To address these issues, and inspired by
signal analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience, this paper proposes a
hallucination detection method based on the frequency-domain analysis of hidden
layer temporal signals, named HSAD (\textbf{H}idden \textbf{S}ignal
\textbf{A}nalysis-based \textbf{D}etection). First, by treating the LLM's
reasoning process as a cognitive journey that unfolds over time, we propose
modeling and simulating the human process of signal perception and
discrimination in a deception-detection scenario through hidden layer temporal
signals. Next, The Fast Fourier Transform is applied to map these temporal
signals into the frequency domain to construct spectral features, which are
used to capture anomalies that arise during the reasoning process; analysis
experiments on these spectral features have proven the effectiveness of this
approach. Finally, a hallucination detection algorithm is designed based on
these spectral features to identify hallucinations in the generated content. By
effectively combining the modeling of the reasoning process with
frequency-domain feature extraction, the HSAD method overcomes the limitations
of existing approaches in terms of knowledge coverage and the detection of
reasoning biases, demonstrating higher detection accuracy and robustness.

*Taiqiang Wu,Runming Yang,Tao Liu,Jiahao Wang,Zenan Xu,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Timber is a training-free method that enhances exploration capability of Instruct models by partially reverting them towards Base models through targeted weight delta refinement, improving Pass@k performance without sacrificing exploitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training is considered superficial with negligible weight changes, but suffers from a trade-off where it improves exploitation at the cost of limiting exploration capabilities.

Method: Timber partially reverts Instruct models towards their paired Base models by performing subtle, targeted refinement of the weight deltas without requiring additional training.

Result: Extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen series show Timber consistently improves vanilla Instruct models, particularly enhancing Pass@k performance.

Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into post-training at the weight level and practical strategies to refine Instruct models without training, balancing exploration and exploitation.

Abstract: Post-training, which elicits a pretrained Base model into the corresponding
Instruct model, is widely considered to be superficial. In this work, we first
reinforce this hypothesis by providing novel quantitative evidence from the
weight level that the effective rank (eRank) remains negligibly changed.
However, this superficiality also suffers a critical trade-off, improving the
exploitation capabilities at the cost of limiting its exploration. To tackle
this issue, we propose Timber, a simple yet effective training-free method that
enhances the exploration capability of the Instruct model while preserving its
exploitation. The key insight is to partially revert Instruct towards the
paired Base model by subtle yet targeted refinement of the weight deltas.
Extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen series demonstrate that Timber
consistently improves vanilla Instruct models, particularly on Pass@k
performance. Our findings offer new insights into the post-training stage at
the weight level and practical strategies to refine the Instruct model without
training.

TL;DR: Latent Codebooks for Fast Thinking enables efficient reasoning by using discrete strategy priors learned from CoT sketches, with GainRouter adaptively switching between fast codebook inference and slow explicit reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reasoning LLMs rely on explicit step-by-step token generation which is inefficient, requiring long reasoning traces that increase latency and token usage.

Method: Uses concise CoT sketches during training to learn a codebook of discrete strategy priors, then conditions on continuous thinking vectors from the codebook at inference. Includes GainRouter for adaptive switching between fast codebook inference and slow explicit reasoning.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior accuracy across multiple reasoning benchmarks while substantially lowering inference cost.

Conclusion: Offers a practical path toward efficient and controllable reasoning in large language models by reducing unnecessary token generation and suppressing overthinking.

Abstract: Reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on generating
explicit tokens step by step, and their effectiveness typically hinges on
large-scale supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques substantially enhance performance on complex
reasoning tasks, they remain inefficient, requiring long reasoning traces that
increase latency and token usage. In this work, we introduce Latent Codebooks
for Fast Thinking, a framework that uses concise CoT sketches only during
training to learn a codebook of discrete strategy priors. At inference, the
model conditions on a handful of continuous thinking vectors distilled from the
codebook in a single pass, enabling strategy-level guidance without producing
explicit reasoning tokens. To complement this design, we propose GainRouter, a
lightweight routing mechanism that adaptively switches between fast codebook
guided inference and slow explicit reasoning, thereby suppressing overthinking
and reducing unnecessary token generation. Experiments across multiple
reasoning benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while substantially lowering inference cost, offering a practical path
toward efficient and controllable reasoning in large language models.

### [428] [Don't Settle Too Early: Self-Reflective Remasking for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23653)
*Zemin Huang,Yuhang Wang,Zhiyang Chen,Guo-Jun Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RemeDi is a mask-based diffusion language model that introduces remasking to enable flexible text refinement by predicting token distributions and confidence scores, allowing low-quality tokens to be remasked and resampled.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mask-based Diffusion Language Models struggle to revise incorrect tokens once generated, as tokens typically remain fixed. The key challenge is identifying potential errors in inputs.

Method: RemeDi jointly predicts token distributions and per-token confidence scores at each step, using confidence scores to determine which tokens to unmask or remask. It employs a remask-aware training pipeline with supervised fine-tuning to detect/remask incorrect tokens and reinforcement learning to optimize generation trajectories.

Result: RemeDi achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source Diffusion Language Models on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed remasking mechanism enables more flexible text refinement in diffusion-based text generation, allowing identification and correction of low-quality tokens through iterative remasking and resampling.

Abstract: Mask-based Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) struggle to revise incorrect
tokens: once a token is generated, it typically remains fixed. The key
challenge is to identify potential errors in the inputs. In this paper, we
propose \emph{\underline{Rem}asking-\underline{e}nabled \underline{Di}ffusion
Language Model (RemeDi}, a mask-based DLM that introduces \emph{remasking} as
another fundamental mechanism, enabling more flexible text refinement in
diffusion-based text generation. To achieve this, RemeDi jointly predicts token
distributions and per-token confidence scores at each step. The confidence
scores determine which tokens to be unmasked after the current step, allowing
the model to identify tokens with low quality and remask them. These remasked
tokens can be resampled with richer context in subsequent steps. We design a
remask-aware pipeline to train this ability, including supervised fine-tuning
which teaches the model to detect and remask incorrect tokens in addition to
predict mask tokens, and reinforcement learning which optimizes full generation
trajectories toward higher rewards. Experiments show that RemeDi achieves the
state-of-the-art results among open-source DLMs on multiple datasets.

*Shulin Huang,Yiran Ding,Junshu Pan,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RL training achieves better cross-lingual reasoning generalization than SFT, with non-English training data yielding superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how reinforcement learning (RL) versus supervised fine-tuning (SFT) affects cross-lingual generalization in complex reasoning tasks, as this comparison remains unexplored despite RL's known advantages.

Method: Systematic experiments using Qwen2.5-3B-Base on diverse multilingual reasoning benchmarks (math, commonsense, and scientific reasoning), comparing RL and SFT approaches with both English and non-English training data.

Result: RL achieves higher accuracy and substantially stronger cross-lingual generalization than SFT. RL training on non-English data yields better overall performance and generalization than English data, unlike SFT.

Conclusion: RL enables more robust reasoning strategies and provides crucial guidance for equitable multilingual reasoning, with compelling evidence for RL's superiority in cross-lingual generalization.

Abstract: Enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)
attracts widespread attention. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
superior performance for improving complex reasoning, its impact on
cross-lingual generalization compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) remains
unexplored. We present the first systematic investigation into cross-lingual
reasoning generalization of RL and SFT. Using Qwen2.5-3B-Base as our foundation
model, we conduct experiments on diverse multilingual reasoning benchmarks,
including math reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and scientific reasoning. Our
investigation yields two significant findings: (1) Tuning with RL not only
achieves higher accuracy but also demonstrates substantially stronger
cross-lingual generalization capabilities compared to SFT. (2) RL training on
non-English data yields better overall performance and generalization than
training on English data, which is not observed with SFT. Furthermore, through
comprehensive mechanistic analyses, we explore the underlying factors of RL's
superiority and generalization across languages. Our results provide compelling
evidence that RL enables the model with more robust reasoning strategies,
offering crucial guidance for more equitable and effective multilingual
reasoning.

Motivation: LLMs have substantial performance gaps between high-resource and mid/low-resource languages due to English-centric pretraining, which undermines reliability in multilingual enterprise applications like customer support and content moderation.

Method: Proposes a practical batch-wise alignment strategy that leverages semantically equivalent multilingual data in each training batch to directly align model outputs across languages.

Result: Improves non-English accuracy by up to 23.9% without compromising English performance, model reasoning, or retrieval quality. Reduces the accuracy drop from 29% to much lower levels.

Conclusion: The method is simple to implement, scalable, and integrates seamlessly with existing LLM training pipelines, enabling more robust and equitable multilingual AI solutions in industry.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain unreliable for global enterprise
applications due to substantial performance gaps between high-resource and
mid/low-resource languages, driven by English-centric pretraining and internal
reasoning biases. This inconsistency undermines customer experience and
operational reliability in multilingual settings such as customer support,
content moderation, and information retrieval. Even with advanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, we observe up to an 29% accuracy
drop in non-English languages compared to English.
  We propose a practical, batch-wise alignment strategy for fine-tuning LLMs,
leveraging semantically equivalent multilingual data in each training batch to
directly align model outputs across languages. This approach improves
non-English accuracy by up to 23.9\% without compromising English performance,
model reasoning, or retrieval quality. Our method is simple to implement,

*Yifeng He,Luning Yang,Christopher Castro Gaw Gonzalo,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TF-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM reasoning capabilities using type inference in System F, with a pure semantics variant that removes natural language cues to test genuine program understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack formal deductive frameworks and cannot distinguish between genuine program semantics reasoning and superficial pattern matching of natural language and code tokens.

Method: Developed TF-Bench based on type inference in System F, with verified transformations to create TF-Bench_pure that removes semantically irrelevant natural language for pure semantics evaluation.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs show substantial limitations, with Claude-3.7-sonnet achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure. Proposed novel metrics for robustness and test-time reasoning effectiveness.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have critical limitations in genuine program semantics reasoning, highlighting essential directions for future research in LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into the software
engineering ecosystem. Their test-time compute (TTC) reasoning capabilities
show significant potential for understanding program logic and semantics beyond
mere token recognition. However, current benchmarks for code reasoning lack a
formal, program-centric deductive framework to ensure sound evaluation, and are
incapable of assessing whether models genuinely reason about program semantics
or merely exploit superficial associations between natural language and code
tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce TF-Bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate LLM reasoning based on type inference in System F, a task we refer to
as program semantics reasoning. By employing verified transformations to remove
semantically irrelevant natural language, we construct TF-Bench_pure, a purely
semantics-driven variant of TF-Bench. Our analysis reveals substantial
limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing LLM
(Claude-3.7-sonnet) achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure.
Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to assess robustness and the
effectiveness of test-time reasoning, underscoring critical limitations in
current LLM capabilities and highlighting essential directions for future
research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods struggle to assess MLLMs' capacity for nuanced, human-like reasoning and decision-making in complex, human-centered environments, creating a need for more systematic evaluation frameworks.

Method: Developed VIVA+ benchmark with three core dimensions: Foundational Situation Comprehension, Context-Driven Action Justification, and Reflective Reasoning. Evaluated latest commercial and open-source MLLMs, and explored targeted training and multi-step reasoning strategies.

Result: Revealed distinct performance patterns and significant challenges among evaluated models. Targeted training and multi-step reasoning strategies yielded consistent performance improvements across models.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have limitations in robust, context-aware, and socially adept decision-making. The analysis provides actionable insights for advancing MLLMs toward better real-world decision-making capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results for embodied
agents in operating meaningfully in complex, human-centered environments. Yet,
evaluating their capacity for nuanced, human-like reasoning and decision-making
remains challenging. In this work, we introduce VIVA+, a cognitively grounded
benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and decision-making of MLLMs in
human-centered situations. VIVA+ consists of 1,317 real-world situations paired
with 6,373 multiple-choice questions, targeting three core abilities for
decision-making: (1) Foundational Situation Comprehension, (2) Context-Driven
Action Justification, and (3) Reflective Reasoning. Together, these dimensions
provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to perceive,
reason, and act in socially meaningful ways. We evaluate the latest commercial
and open-source models on VIVA+, where we reveal distinct performance patterns
and highlight significant challenges. We further explore targeted training and
multi-step reasoning strategies, which yield consistent performance
improvements. Finally, our in-depth analysis highlights current model
limitations and provides actionable insights for advancing MLLMs toward more
robust, context-aware, and socially adept decision-making in real-world

### [433] [Collaboration of Fusion and Independence: Hypercomplex-driven Robust Multi-Modal Knowledge Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23714)
*Zhiqiang Liu,Yichi Zhang,Mengshu Sun,Lei Liang,Wen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M-Hyper is a novel multi-modal knowledge graph completion method that integrates both fused and independent modality representations using quaternion algebra, achieving state-of-the-art performance through fine-grained factorization and robust modality fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMKGC methods have limitations: fusion-based methods lose modality-specific information and lack flexibility, while ensemble-based methods fail to capture nuanced cross-modal interactions. There's a need for a method that combines the strengths of both paradigms.

Method: Proposes M-Hyper using quaternion algebra with four orthogonal bases to represent independent modalities. Includes Fine-grained Entity Representation Factorization (FERF) and Robust Relation-aware Modality Fusion (R2MF) modules to obtain robust representations for three independent and one fused modality, mapped to biquaternion bases for comprehensive interaction modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: M-Hyper successfully overcomes limitations of both fusion-based and ensemble-based MMKGC methods by enabling coexistence and collaboration of fused and independent modality representations through quaternion-based modeling, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to discover missing facts
in multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) by leveraging both structural
relationships and diverse modality information of entities. Existing MMKGC
methods follow two multi-modal paradigms: fusion-based and ensemble-based.
Fusion-based methods employ fixed fusion strategies, which inevitably leads to
the loss of modality-specific information and a lack of flexibility to adapt to
varying modality relevance across contexts. In contrast, ensemble-based methods
retain modality independence through dedicated sub-models but struggle to
capture the nuanced, context-dependent semantic interplay between modalities.
To overcome these dual limitations, we propose a novel MMKGC method M-Hyper,
which achieves the coexistence and collaboration of fused and independent
modality representations. Our method integrates the strengths of both
paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal interactions while maintaining
modality-specific information. Inspired by ``quaternion'' algebra, we utilize
its four orthogonal bases to represent multiple independent modalities and
employ the Hamilton product to efficiently model pair-wise interactions among
them. Specifically, we introduce a Fine-grained Entity Representation
Factorization (FERF) module and a Robust Relation-aware Modality Fusion (R2MF)
module to obtain robust representations for three independent modalities and
one fused modality. The resulting four modality representations are then mapped
to the four orthogonal bases of a biquaternion (a hypercomplex extension of
quaternion) for comprehensive modality interaction. Extensive experiments
indicate its state-of-the-art performance, robustness, and computational
efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLMs on Romanian driving-law QA with explanations, finding that fine-tuned 8B models compete with SOTA, textual image descriptions outperform visual input, and LLM-as-a-Judge reveals self-preference bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure road safety by helping both new and experienced drivers master current traffic rules through explainable QA systems for less-resourced languages like Romanian.

Method: Created a 1,208-question dataset (387 multimodal), compared text-only and multimodal SOTA systems, fine-tuned Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct and RoLlama 3.1-8B-Instruct, and used LLM-as-a-Judge to assess explanation quality.

Result: SOTA models perform well, but fine-tuned 8B models are competitive. Textual descriptions of images outperform direct visual input. LLM-as-a-Judge reveals self-preference bias in explanation assessment.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for developing explainable QA systems for less-resourced languages, showing the effectiveness of fine-tuned smaller models and the limitations of LLM-based evaluation.

Abstract: Ensuring that both new and experienced drivers master current traffic rules
is critical to road safety. This paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs)

*Yucheng Wang,Yifan Hou,Aydin Javadov,Mubashara Akhtar,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with cross-modal reasoning due to integration failures, not perception issues. Additional modalities help only when providing independent reasoning paths, while redundant or chained support often hurts performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address conflicting reports on whether added modalities help or harm multimodal reasoning performance, and to understand when and why modality interactions support or undermine reasoning through controlled evaluation.

Method: Developed a logic-grounded evaluation framework categorizing multimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, analyzing models' internals through attention patterns and testing simple two-step prompting (recognize then reason).

Result: Additional modalities enhance reasoning only when providing independent and sufficient reasoning paths. Performance degrades due to: weaker modalities dragging down overall performance, conflicts biasing preference toward certain modalities, and ineffective integration of joint signals. Two core failures identified: task-composition bottleneck and fusion bottleneck.

Conclusion: Integration, not perception, is the main barrier to multimodal reasoning. Composition-aware training and early fusion control are promising directions to address the identified bottlenecks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise enhanced reasoning by
integrating diverse inputs such as text, vision, and audio. Yet cross-modal
reasoning remains underexplored, with conflicting reports on whether added
modalities help or harm performance. These inconsistencies stem from a lack of
controlled evaluation frameworks and analysis of models' internals to isolate
when and why modality interactions support or undermine reasoning. We address
this gap through a logic-grounded evaluation framework that categorizes
multimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, varying how facts are
distributed across modalities and logically combined. Empirically, additional
modalities enhance reasoning only when they provide independent and sufficient
reasoning paths, while redundant or chained entailment support often hurts
performance. Moreover, reasoning degrades in three systematic ways: weaker
modalities drag down overall performance, conflicts bias preference toward
certain modalities, and joint signals from different modalities fail to be
integrated effectively. Therefore, we identify two core failures:
task-composition bottleneck, where recognition and reasoning cannot be jointly
executed in one pass, and fusion bottleneck, where early integration introduces
bias. For further investigation, we find that attention patterns fail to encode
fact usefulness, but a simple two-step prompting (recognize then reason)
restores performance, confirming the task-composition bottleneck. Moreover,
modality identity remains recoverable in early layers, and softening attention
in early fusion improves reasoning, highlighting biased fusion as another
failure mode. Overall, our findings show that integration, not perception, is
the main barrier to multimodal reasoning, suggesting composition-aware training
and early fusion control as promising directions.

*Chao Wang,Rui-Chen Zheng,Yang Ai,Zhen-Hua Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speech integration in LLMs degrades textual competence due to parameter importance distribution shift; proposed mitigation strategies (layer-wise learning rate and LoRA) preserve textual knowledge while improving speech performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech-enabled LLMs suffer from weakened textual competence, limiting their ability to leverage pre-trained text knowledge effectively.

Method: Used parameter importance estimation to analyze encoder-adaptor paradigm, then investigated layer-wise learning rate scheduling and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to preserve original parameter distribution.

Result: Both mitigation strategies maintained textual competence better than full fine-tuning while improving spoken question answering performance.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of proposed strategies is linked to structural properties of textual knowledge in LLMs, providing principled explanation for their benefits.

Abstract: The integration of speech into Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially
expanded their capabilities, but often at the cost of weakening their core
textual competence. This degradation limits the ability of speech-enabled LLMs
to fully exploit their pre-trained text-based knowledge. In this work, we
analyze the underlying mechanisms of this issue through a focused study of the
widely used encoder-adaptor paradigm. We propose an analytical framework based
on parameter importance estimation, which reveals that fine-tuning for speech
introduces a textual importance distribution shift: the layer-wise allocation
of parameters critical to textual reasoning is disrupted. Building on this
insight, we investigate two mitigation strategies: layer-wise learning rate
scheduling and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), both aim to preserve the original
parameter distribution. Experimental results show that both approaches better
maintain textual competence than full fine-tuning, while also improving
downstream spoken question answering performance. Furthermore, our analysis
offers a principled explanation for the effectiveness of the proposed
mitigation strategies, linking their benefits to the structural properties of
textual knowledge in LLMs.

TL;DR: KLCF is a reinforcement learning framework that addresses LLM hallucinations by ensuring knowledge consistency between policy and base models through dual-fact alignment, improving factual recall and precision without external knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination and factuality deficits in LLMs during long-form generation remain major reliability obstacles, with existing RLHF frameworks often ignoring model knowledge boundaries and exacerbating hallucination tax.

Method: Proposes Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning Framework (KLCF) with Dual-Fact Alignment mechanism. Uses pretrained knowledge boundaries to construct fact checklists for improving factual coverage/recall, and trains self-assessment module based on base model's internal knowledge for factual precision.

Result: Experimental results show KLCF substantially improves factuality metrics across multiple long-form benchmarks and effectively alleviates model hallucinations.

Conclusion: KLCF provides an efficient, external-knowledge-free, and scalable solution to improve LLM factuality in long-form generation by focusing on internal knowledge consistency rather than relying on external retrieval or verification.

Abstract: Hallucination and factuality deficits remain key obstacles to the reliability
of large language models (LLMs) in long-form generation. Existing reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) frameworks primarily rely on preference
rewards, yet they often overlook the model's internal knowledge boundaries,
exacerbating the so-called "hallucination tax". To address this challenge, we
propose Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning Framework (KLCF), a
novel framework that focuses on the knowledge consistency between the policy
model's expressed knowledge and the base model's parametric knowledge, and
introduces a Dual-Fact Alignment mechanism to jointly optimize factual recall
and precision. Specifically, KLCF leverages pretrained knowledge boundaries to
construct fact checklist, guiding online reinforcement learning to improve
factual coverage and recall; simultaneously, it trains a self-assessment module
based on the base model's internal knowledge to enhance factual precision
during generation. Unlike prior methods that rely on external retrieval or
heavy verification, our reward design is fully external-knowledge-free and
lightweight, making KLCF efficient and easily scalable to large-scale training.
Experimental results demonstrate that KLCF substantially improves factuality
metrics across multiple long-form benchmarks and effectively alleviates model
hallucinations.

TL;DR: LoGo framework addresses LLM personalization challenges by combining local user memory with global collective memory and using a mediator to resolve conflicts, improving both cold-start and biasing problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two key challenges in LLM personalization: cold-start problem (insufficient user history) and biasing problem (overfitting to skewed user preferences), which stem from inability to model collective knowledge across users.

Method: Propose LoGo framework with local-global memory: local memory for individual user preferences and global memory for shared interests across population, plus a mediator module to resolve conflicts between local and global signals.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show LoGo consistently improves personalization quality by warming up cold-start users and mitigating biased predictions.

Conclusion: Incorporating collective knowledge is crucial for enhancing LLM personalization, as demonstrated by the effectiveness of the LoGo framework.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to tailor model behavior to
individual users based on their historical interactions. However, its
effectiveness is often hindered by two key challenges: the \textit{cold-start
problem}, where users with limited history provide insufficient context for
accurate personalization, and the \textit{biasing problem}, where users with
abundant but skewed history cause the model to overfit to narrow preferences.
We identify both issues as symptoms of a common underlying limitation, i.e.,
the inability to model collective knowledge across users. To address this, we
propose a local-global memory framework (LoGo) that combines the personalized
local memory with a collective global memory that captures shared interests
across the population. To reconcile discrepancies between these two memory
sources, we introduce a mediator module designed to resolve conflicts between
local and global signals. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LoGo consistently improves personalization quality by both
warming up cold-start users and mitigating biased predictions. These results
highlight the importance of incorporating collective knowledge to enhance LLM
personalization.

TL;DR: KAPPA is a parameter-free intervention that aligns LLMs' hidden states to bridge the knowledge-prediction gap in multiple-choice questions, improving accuracy by transforming states along knowledge and prediction bases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail on MCQs despite having correct knowledge, creating a knowledge-prediction gap that needs investigation and mitigation.

Method: Identified two key bases in residual streams (knowledge basis and prediction basis), then developed KAPPA to transform hidden states to align these bases through projection-based adjustment.

Result: KAPPA substantially improves accuracy on binary-choice reformulations of Big-Bench-Hard and ARC-Challenge, outperforms baselines, and extends effectiveness to free-form questions.

Conclusion: Provides geometric understanding of knowledge-prediction gap and offers practical method to better align model behavior with latent knowledge through subspace alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail on multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
despite demonstrating correct knowledge in other contexts, such as free-form
generation. To investigate the mechanism underlying this knowledge-prediction
gap on MCQs and alleviate it, we conduct a probing analysis and find that
residual streams in certain layers contain a subspace spanned by two important
bases: a \emph{knowledge basis} that encodes the probability of the
ground-truth answer for a given MCQ and a \emph{prediction basis} that encodes
the probability of the answer choice predicted by the model. We observe that
incorrect predictions arise from a misalignment of the model's hidden states
along these two bases. Hence, we introduce \textbf{KAPPA} (Knowledge-Aligned
Prediction through Projection-based Adjustment), a parameter-free intervention
that transforms the hidden states to align the prediction coordinate with the
knowledge coordinate within this subspace. Experiments on binary-choice
reformulations of Big-Bench-Hard and ARC-Challenge show that KAPPA
substantially improves accuracy and consistently outperforms baselines. While
optimal subspaces differ across tasks, subspaces generalize to some extent, as
supported by cross-dataset experiments. Moreover, KAPPA extends its
effectiveness to free-form questions beyond MCQs. Our work provides a new
geometric understanding of the knowledge-prediction gap and offers a practical
method for better aligning model behavior with its latent knowledge.

*Arti Rani,Shweta Singh,Nihar Ranjan Sahoo,Gaurav Kumar Nayak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Open-DeBias is a novel debiasing method that uses adapter modules to mitigate both known and unseen biases in LLMs, achieving significant improvements in QA accuracy and multilingual generalization with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often encode harmful biases that compromise fairness, but existing bias mitigation approaches are limited to predefined categories and cannot address novel or emergent biases effectively.

Method: Proposed Open-DeBias method using adapter modules for data-efficient and parameter-efficient debiasing, fine-tuned on small fractions of training data to mitigate social and stereotypical biases while generalizing to unseen biases.

Result: Open-DeBias improves QA accuracy on BBQ dataset by 48% on ambiguous subsets and 6% on disambiguated ones. Zero-shot transfer to Korean BBQ achieves 84% accuracy, demonstrating robust multilingual generalization.

Conclusion: Open-DeBias is an effective, robust, and language-agnostic method for open-domain bias mitigation that generalizes well across multiple NLP tasks and languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success on question
answering (QA) tasks, yet they often encode harmful biases that compromise
fairness and trustworthiness. Most existing bias mitigation approaches are
restricted to predefined categories, limiting their ability to address novel or
context-specific emergent biases. To bridge this gap, we tackle the novel
problem of open-set bias detection and mitigation in text-based QA. We
introduce OpenBiasBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate biases
across a wide range of categories and subgroups, encompassing both known and
previously unseen biases. Additionally, we propose Open-DeBias, a novel,
data-efficient, and parameter-efficient debiasing method that leverages adapter
modules to mitigate existing social and stereotypical biases while generalizing
to unseen ones. Compared to the state-of-the-art BMBI method, Open-DeBias
improves QA accuracy on BBQ dataset by nearly $48\%$ on ambiguous subsets and
$6\%$ on disambiguated ones, using adapters fine-tuned on just a small fraction
of the training data. Remarkably, the same adapters, in a zero-shot transfer to
Korean BBQ, achieve $84\%$ accuracy, demonstrating robust language-agnostic
generalization. Through extensive evaluation, we also validate the
effectiveness of Open-DeBias across a broad range of NLP tasks, including
StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs, highlighting its robustness, multilingual strength,

### [442] [SPELL: Self-Play Reinforcement Learning for evolving Long-Context Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23863)
*Ziyi Yang,Weizhou Shen,Ruijun Chen,Chenliang Li,Fanqi Wan,Ming Yan,Xiaojun Quan,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPELL is a multi-role self-play reinforcement learning framework that enables scalable, label-free optimization for long-context reasoning in LLMs through cyclical questioner-responder-verifier roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in long-context reasoning for LLMs has lagged due to difficulty processing long texts and scarcity of reliable human annotations and verifiable reward signals.

Method: SPELL integrates three cyclical roles (questioner, responder, verifier) within a single model for self-improvement. Uses automated curriculum with increasing document length and adaptive reward function based on question difficulty.

Result: Extensive experiments on six long-context benchmarks show consistent performance improvements across diverse LLMs, outperforming equally sized models fine-tuned on large-scale annotated data. Achieved 7.6-point gain in pass@8 on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking.

Conclusion: SPELL shows promise for scaling to more capable models and raises performance ceiling for long-context reasoning without requiring large-scale annotated data.

Abstract: Progress in long-context reasoning for large language models (LLMs) has
lagged behind other recent advances. This gap arises not only from the
intrinsic difficulty of processing long texts, but also from the scarcity of
reliable human annotations and programmatically verifiable reward signals. In
this paper, we propose SPELL, a multi-role self-play reinforcement learning
framework that enables scalable, label-free optimization for long-context
reasoning. SPELL integrates three cyclical roles-questioner, responder, and
verifier-within a single model to enable continual self-improvement. The
questioner generates questions from raw documents paired with reference
answers; the responder learns to solve these questions based on the documents;
and the verifier evaluates semantic equivalence between the responder's output
and the questioner's reference answer, producing reward signals to guide
continual training. To stabilize training, we introduce an automated curriculum
that gradually increases document length and a reward function that adapts
question difficulty to the model's evolving capabilities. Extensive experiments
on six long-context benchmarks show that SPELL consistently improves
performance across diverse LLMs and outperforms equally sized models fine-tuned
on large-scale annotated data. Notably, SPELL achieves an average 7.6-point
gain in pass@8 on the strong reasoning model Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, raising
its performance ceiling and showing promise for scaling to even more capable
models.

### [443] [Winning the Pruning Gamble: A Unified Approach to Joint Sample and Token Pruning for Efficient Supervised Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23873)
*Shaobo Wang,Jiaming Wang,Jiajun Zhang,Cong Wang,Yue Min,Zichen Wen,Fei Huang,Huiqiang Jiang,Junyang Lin,Dayiheng Liu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Q-Tuning is a unified framework that jointly optimizes sample and token pruning for efficient supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 12.5% of training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data pruning methods operate in isolation at either sample or token level, leading to inefficiencies where high-value samples may contain redundant tokens and token pruning may discard crucial instructional signals.

Method: Q-Tuning uses a two-stage strategy: 1) sample-level triage to retain examples with informative misconceptions or calibration signals, 2) asymmetric token pruning that trims less salient tokens only from misconception samples while preserving calibration samples entirely.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art across five benchmarks. On SmolLM2-1.7B, achieves +38% average improvement over full-data SFT baseline using only 12.5% of original training data.

Conclusion: Q-Tuning is the first dynamic pruning approach to consistently outperform full-data training, providing a practical and scalable blueprint for maximizing data utilization in budget-constrained LLM SFT.

Abstract: As supervised fine-tuning (SFT) evolves from a lightweight post-training step
into a compute-intensive phase rivaling mid-training in scale, data efficiency
has become critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) under tight
budgets. Existing data pruning methods suffer from a fragmented design: they
operate either at the sample level or the token level in isolation, failing to
jointly optimize both dimensions. This disconnect leads to significant
inefficiencies--high-value samples may still contain redundant tokens, while
token-level pruning often discards crucial instructional or corrective signals
embedded in individual examples. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the
Error-Uncertainty (EU) Plane, a diagnostic framework that jointly characterizes
the heterogeneous utility of training data across samples and tokens. Guided by
this insight, we propose Quadrant-based Tuning (Q-Tuning), a unified framework
that strategically coordinates sample pruning and token pruning. Q-Tuning
employs a two-stage strategy: first, it performs sample-level triage to retain
examples rich in informative misconceptions or calibration signals; second, it
applies an asymmetric token-pruning policy, using a context-aware scoring
mechanism to trim less salient tokens exclusively from misconception samples
while preserving calibration samples in their entirety. Our method sets a new
state of the art across five diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, on SmolLM2-1.7B,
Q-Tuning achieves a +38\% average improvement over the full-data SFT baseline
using only 12.5\% of the original training data. As the first dynamic pruning
approach to consistently outperform full-data training, Q-Tuning provides a
practical and scalable blueprint for maximizing data utilization in
budget-constrained LLM SFT.

### [444] [DocPruner: A Storage-Efficient Framework for Multi-Vector Visual Document Retrieval via Adaptive Patch-Level Embedding Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23883)
*Yibo Yan,Guangwei Xu,Xin Zou,Shuliang Liu,James Kwok,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DocPruner is a framework that reduces storage overhead in visual document retrieval by adaptively pruning redundant patch-level embeddings using intra-document attention distribution, achieving 50-60% storage reduction with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-vector VDR methods using LVLMs create prohibitive storage overhead by representing each document with hundreds of patch-level embeddings, making large-scale deployment impractical.

Method: DocPruner leverages intra-document patch attention distribution to dynamically identify and discard redundant embeddings for each document through adaptive patch-level embedding pruning.

Result: Achieves 50-60% reduction in storage for leading multi-vector VDR models with negligible degradation in retrieval performance across more than ten representative datasets.

Conclusion: DocPruner provides a robust, flexible, and effective solution for building storage-efficient, large-scale VDR systems.

Abstract: Visual Document Retrieval (VDR), the task of retrieving visually-rich
document pages using queries that combine visual and textual cues, is crucial
for numerous real-world applications. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in a multi-vector paradigm, representing
each document as patch-level embeddings to capture fine-grained details. While
highly effective, this approach introduces a critical challenge: prohibitive
storage overhead, as storing hundreds of vectors per page makes large-scale
deployment costly and impractical. To address this, we introduce DocPruner, the
first framework to employ adaptive patch-level embedding pruning for VDR to
effectively reduce the storage overhead. DocPruner leverages the intra-document
patch attention distribution to dynamically identify and discard redundant
embeddings for each document. This adaptive mechanism enables a significant
50-60% reduction in storage for leading multi-vector VDR models with negligible
degradation in document retrieval performance. Extensive experiments across
more than ten representative datasets validate that DocPruner offers a robust,
flexible, and effective solution for building storage-efficient, large-scale
VDR systems.

### [445] [Taming Masked Diffusion Language Models via Consistency Trajectory Reinforcement Learning with Fewer Decoding Step](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23924)
*Jingyi Yang,Guanxu Chen,Xuhao Hu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes EOSER and ASS decoding strategies and CJ-GRPO reinforcement learning method to optimize masked diffusion language models (MDLMs), addressing training-inference inconsistencies and enabling efficient full diffusion-style decoding with fewer steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked diffusion language models offer advantages like parallel decoding and flexible generation orders, but existing decoding strategies and RL algorithms are not well-suited for them. Direct transfer from autoregressive models creates inconsistencies due to MDLMs' non-causal parallel decoding nature.

Method: Proposes EOSER (EOS Early Rejection) and ASS (Ascending Step-Size) decoding scheduler for efficient full diffusion-style decoding, and CJ-GRPO (Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization) RL method that ensures consistency between rollout and optimization trajectories while reducing skip-step optimization errors.

Result: Experiments on reasoning tasks using LLaDA-8B-Instruct show the proposed methods achieve competitive performance with fewer decoding steps and effectively tame MDLMs.

Conclusion: The EOSER and ASS mechanisms combined with CJ-GRPO provide promising solutions for effectively and efficiently optimizing masked diffusion language models, addressing key challenges in decoding strategies and reinforcement learning for MDLMs.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) language models, offering properties such as
parallel decoding, flexible generation orders, and the potential for fewer
inference steps. Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored.
A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR
models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive
transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding
strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they
outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL
algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a
training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal
(parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and
the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early
Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which
unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding,
achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we
introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO)
for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory
and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by
skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks,
such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct. The
results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with
CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs.

### [446] [Assessing Large Language Models in Updating Their Forecasts with New Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23936)
*Zhangdie Yuan,Zifeng Ding,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EVOLVECAST framework evaluates how LLMs update predictions when given new information post-training, comparing them to human forecasters and finding inconsistent, conservative updates with poor confidence calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work treated future event prediction as static, ignoring how forecasts should evolve with new evidence. This gap needs addressing to understand LLM belief updating.

Method: Introduce EVOLVECAST framework to assess LLM prediction revision when presented with post-training information, using human forecasters as reference for analyzing prediction shifts and confidence calibration.

Result: LLMs show some responsiveness to new information but updates are inconsistent or overly conservative. Neither verbalized nor logits-based confidence estimates consistently outperform each other, both falling short of human standards. Models exhibit conservative bias across settings.

Conclusion: Current LLM approaches to belief updating are inadequate, showing conservative bias and poor calibration, highlighting the need for more robust belief updating methods.

Abstract: Prior work has largely treated future event prediction as a static task,
failing to consider how forecasts and the confidence in them should evolve as
new evidence emerges. To address this gap, we introduce EVOLVECAST, a framework
for evaluating whether large language models appropriately revise their
predictions in response to new information. In particular, EVOLVECAST assesses
whether LLMs adjust their forecasts when presented with information released
after their training cutoff. We use human forecasters as a comparative
reference to analyze prediction shifts and confidence calibration under updated
contexts. While LLMs demonstrate some responsiveness to new information, their
updates are often inconsistent or overly conservative. We further find that
neither verbalized nor logits-based confidence estimates consistently
outperform the other, and both remain far from the human reference standard.
Across settings, models tend to express conservative bias, underscoring the
need for more robust approaches to belief updating.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Easy Turn is an open-source, bimodal turn-taking detection model that integrates acoustic and linguistic information to predict four dialogue states, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a new 1,145-hour dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-duplex interaction requires robust turn-taking detection, but existing solutions are either not open-sourced, limited to single modality, have large parameter sizes, or require scarce full-duplex data.

Method: Proposed Easy Turn - a modular turn-taking detection model that integrates acoustic and linguistic bimodal information to predict four dialogue turn states: complete, incomplete, backchannel, and wait. Also released Easy Turn trainset, a 1,145-hour speech dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art turn-taking detection accuracy on the open-source Easy Turn testset compared to existing models like TEN Turn Detection and Smart Turn V2.

Conclusion: Easy Turn provides an effective open-source solution for turn-taking detection with bimodal integration, accompanied by a large publicly available dataset to advance full-duplex human-machine communication.

Abstract: Full-duplex interaction is crucial for natural human-machine communication,
yet remains challenging as it requires robust turn-taking detection to decide
when the system should speak, listen, or remain silent. Existing solutions
either rely on dedicated turn-taking models, most of which are not
open-sourced. The few available ones are limited by their large parameter size
or by supporting only a single modality, such as acoustic or linguistic.
Alternatively, some approaches finetune LLM backbones to enable full-duplex
capability, but this requires large amounts of full-duplex data, which remain
scarce in open-source form. To address these issues, we propose Easy Turn, an
open-source, modular turn-taking detection model that integrates acoustic and
linguistic bimodal information to predict four dialogue turn states: complete,
incomplete, backchannel, and wait, accompanied by the release of Easy Turn
trainset, a 1,145-hour speech dataset designed for training turn-taking
detection models. Compared to existing open-source models like TEN Turn
Detection and Smart Turn V2, our model achieves state-of-the-art turn-taking
detection accuracy on our open-source Easy Turn testset. The data and model
will be made publicly available on GitHub.

### [448] [Vision-Grounded Machine Interpreting: Improving the Translation Process through Visual Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23957)
*Claudio Fantinuoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Vision-Grounded Interpreting (VGI) integrates visual input with speech to improve machine interpreting by addressing ambiguities through multimodal context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine interpreting systems rely solely on linguistic signals, limiting performance in contexts requiring visual or situational cues for disambiguation.

Method: Developed a prototype system using a vision-language model that processes both speech and webcam visual input to prime translation with contextual visual information.

Result: Visual grounding significantly improved lexical disambiguation, showed modest gains for gender resolution, but provided no benefit for syntactic ambiguities.

Conclusion: Multimodal approaches are essential for advancing translation quality in machine interpreting systems.

Abstract: Machine Interpreting systems are currently implemented as unimodal, real-time
speech-to-speech architectures, processing translation exclusively on the basis
of the linguistic signal. Such reliance on a single modality, however,
constrains performance in contexts where disambiguation and adequacy depend on
additional cues, such as visual, situational, or pragmatic information. This
paper introduces Vision-Grounded Interpreting (VGI), a novel approach designed
to address the limitations of unimodal machine interpreting. We present a
prototype system that integrates a vision-language model to process both speech
and visual input from a webcam, with the aim of priming the translation process
through contextual visual information. To evaluate the effectiveness of this
approach, we constructed a hand-crafted diagnostic corpus targeting three types
of ambiguity. In our evaluation, visual grounding substantially improves
lexical disambiguation, yields modest and less stable gains for gender
resolution, and shows no benefit for syntactic ambiguities. We argue that
embracing multimodality represents a necessary step forward for advancing
translation quality in machine interpreting.

TL;DR: HiPO is a framework for adaptive reasoning control that enables LLMs to selectively decide when to use detailed reasoning (Think-on) and when to respond directly (Think-off), reducing token usage while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs always generate lengthy chain-of-thought reasoning traces, which is inefficient and leads to excessive token usage and higher inference costs.

Method: HiPO combines a hybrid data pipeline with paired Think-on/Think-off responses and a hybrid reinforcement learning reward system that balances accuracy and efficiency.

Result: Experiments across mathematics and coding benchmarks show HiPO substantially reduces token length while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: HiPO provides a principled approach for efficient adaptive reasoning, advancing the deployment of reasoning-oriented LLMs in resource-sensitive real-world settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning to improve accuracy on complex tasks. However, always generating
lengthy reasoning traces is inefficient, leading to excessive token usage and
higher inference costs. This paper introduces the Hybrid Policy Optimization
(i.e., HiPO), a framework for adaptive reasoning control that enables LLMs to
selectively decide when to engage in detailed reasoning (Think-on) and when to
respond directly (Think-off). Specifically, HiPO combines a hybrid data
pipelineproviding paired Think-on and Think-off responseswith a hybrid
reinforcement learning reward system that balances accuracy and efficiency
while avoiding over-reliance on detailed reasoning. Experiments across
mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate that HiPO can substantially
reduce token length while maintaining or improving accuracy. Finally, we hope
HiPO a can be a principled approach for efficient adaptive reasoning, advancing
the deployment of reasoning-oriented LLMs in real-world, resource-sensitive
settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ByteSized32Refactored is a refactored, modular implementation of the ByteSized32 corpus for text game generation, featuring a centralized GameBasic.py foundation library that reduces code by 50% and enables extensibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of simulating interactive world models in LLMs by creating a more modular and extensible text game generation framework.

Method: Refactored the original ByteSized32 corpus by creating GameBasic.py foundation library with 7 base classes (GameObject, etc.) to centralize common logic, reducing code from 20k to 10k lines while maintaining modularity.

Result: Experiments with GPT-4o showed mixed performance - quality improvements on two evaluation dimensions but decreases on the other two, indicating that the hierarchical structure presents new challenges for LLMs.

Conclusion: The extensible code structure with foundation library and modular optimization facilitates LLM adaptation and establishes a scalable environment for future extensions, though the hierarchical structure presents new challenges for LLMs.

Abstract: Simulating interactive world models remains a core challenge in Large
Language Models(LLMs). In this work, we introduce the ByteSized32Refactored, a
refactored, modular, and extensible implementation of the original ByteSized32
corpus to explore the task of text game generation. We further optimize the
code structure of each text game and create the GameBasic.py foundation
library, which centralizes common logic across all 32 games by abstracting 7
base classes (GameObject, etc.) into reusable modules, thereby reducing from
20k to 10k total lines of Python code compared to the original Bytesized32. Our
refactored implementation enables extendability - with our centralized design,
ByteSized32Refactored can be more efficiently extended to include text games of
new scenarios and specifications by reusing the shared logic and
functionalities. Extensive experiments with GPT-4o demonstrate a mix of
performance - with Bytesized32Refactored, the generated text games for unseen
scenarios showcase quality improvements on two of the four evaluation
dimensions while decreases on the other two, indicating that the hierarchical
structure of the refactored code presents new challenges for LLMs. Overall, we
highlight that our extensible code structure, centered on the foundation
library and the modular optimization, not only facilitates LLM adaptation to
environment specifications but also establishes a scalable environment that
supports future extensions.

TL;DR: PaLRS is a training-free method for aligning LLMs with human preferences using residual steering vectors extracted from preference data, achieving performance gains without expensive optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference alignment methods like RLHF and DPO require curated data, expensive optimization over billions of parameters, and create persistent task-specific models, making them inefficient and inflexible.

Method: Extracts lightweight steering vectors from residual streams of LLMs using as few as 100 preference pairs, enabling plug-and-play application at inference time without training.

Result: PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks while preserving baseline performance, outperforming DPO-aligned models with huge time savings.

Conclusion: PaLRS offers an effective, efficient, and flexible alternative to standard preference optimization pipelines, providing training-free alignment with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: Preference alignment is a critical step in making Large Language Models
(LLMs) useful and aligned with (human) preferences. Existing approaches such as
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or Direct Preference Optimization
typically require curated data and expensive optimization over billions of
parameters, and eventually lead to persistent task-specific models. In this
work, we introduce Preference alignment of Large Language Models via Residual
Steering (PaLRS), a training-free method that exploits preference signals
encoded in the residual streams of LLMs. From as few as one hundred preference
pairs, PaLRS extracts lightweight, plug-and-play steering vectors that can be
applied at inference time to push models toward preferred behaviors. We
evaluate PaLRS on various small-to-medium-scale open-source LLMs, showing that
PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and
code generation benchmarks while preserving baseline general-purpose
performance. Moreover, when compared to DPO-aligned models, they perform better
with huge time savings. Our findings highlight that PaLRS offers an effective,
much more efficient and flexible alternative to standard preference
optimization pipelines, offering a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism for
alignment with minimal data.

TL;DR: Model compression strategies (distillation and quantization) can significantly reduce computational costs and environmental impact while maintaining competitive translation quality, with minimal performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about computational and environmental costs of large language models by investigating trade-offs between translation quality and efficiency.

Method: Compared full-scale, distilled, and quantized models on Flores+ benchmark and human evaluations of conversational translations in French, Hindi, and Kannada. Analyzed carbon emissions per evaluation run.

Result: Distilled models achieved 4.5x faster inference with minimal BLEU score reductions. Aggressive quantization (INT4) preserved high accuracy and fluency. Full 3.3B fp32 model had highest environmental footprint (0.007-0.008 kg CO2 per run).

Conclusion: Model compression can substantially reduce computational demands and environmental impact while maintaining competitive quality, though trade-offs are more pronounced in low-resource settings. Evaluation frameworks should integrate efficiency and sustainability alongside objective metrics.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns
about their computational and environmental costs. This study investigates the
trade-offs between translation quality and efficiency by comparing full-scale,
distilled, and quantized models using machine translation as a case study. We
evaluated performance on the Flores+ benchmark and through human judgments of
conversational translations in French, Hindi, and Kannada. Our analysis of
carbon emissions per evaluation run revealed that the full 3.3B fp32 model,
while achieving the highest BLEU scores, incurred the largest environmental
footprint (about 0.007-0.008 kg CO2 per run). The distilled models achieved an
inference of up to 4.5x faster than the full 3.3B model, with only minimal
reductions in BLEU scores. Human evaluations also showed that even aggressive
quantization (INT4) preserved high levels of accuracy and fluency, with
differences between models generally minor. These findings demonstrate that
model compression strategies can substantially reduce computational demands and
environmental impact while maintaining competitive translation quality, though
trade-offs are more pronounced in low-resource settings. We argue for
evaluation frameworks that integrate efficiency and sustainability alongside
objective metrics as central dimensions of progress in NLP.

TL;DR: MCPMark is a new benchmark for evaluating MCP (Model Context Protocol) use in realistic workflows, featuring 127 tasks with diverse CRUD operations that require rich environment interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCP benchmarks are too narrow, focusing on read-heavy tasks with limited interaction depth, and fail to capture the complexity of real-world workflows.

Method: Created 127 high-quality tasks collaboratively by domain experts and AI agents, each with curated initial states and programmatic scripts for automatic verification. Evaluated using a minimal agent framework with tool-calling loops.

Result: Best-performing model (gpt-5-medium) achieved only 52.56% pass@1 and 33.86% pass^4. Other strong models like claude-sonnet-4 and o3 fell below 30% pass@1 and 15% pass^4. LLMs required average 16.2 execution turns and 17.4 tool calls per task.

Conclusion: MCPMark successfully highlights the stress-testing nature of realistic MCP workflows, showing current LLMs struggle significantly with complex, multi-step interactions despite their capabilities on simpler benchmarks.

Abstract: MCP standardizes how LLMs interact with external systems, forming the
foundation for general agents. However, existing MCP benchmarks remain narrow
in scope: they focus on read-heavy tasks or tasks with limited interaction
depth, and fail to capture the complexity and realism of real-world workflows.
To address this gap, we propose MCPMark, a benchmark designed to evaluate MCP
use in a more realistic and comprehensive manner. It consists of $127$
high-quality tasks collaboratively created by domain experts and AI agents.
Each task begins with a curated initial state and includes a programmatic
script for automatic verification. These tasks demand richer and more diverse
interactions with the environment, involving a broad range of create, read,
update, and delete (CRUD) operations. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
cutting-edge LLMs using a minimal agent framework that operates in a
tool-calling loop. Empirical results show that the best-performing model,
gpt-5-medium, reaches only $52.56$\% pass@1 and $33.86$\% pass^4, while other
widely regarded strong models, including claude-sonnet-4 and o3, fall below
$30$\% pass@1 and $15$\% pass^4. On average, LLMs require $16.2$ execution
turns and $17.4$ tool calls per task, significantly surpassing those in
previous MCP benchmarks and highlighting the stress-testing nature of MCPMark.

Motivation: To overcome limitations of diffusion language models (fixed-length decoding, KV-cache incompatibility) and block diffusion (fixed block size, expensive training) by creating a more flexible and efficient generation approach.

Method: Proposes Next Sequence Prediction (NSP) that adaptively determines generation length at each step, and Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM) that performs diffusion inference within mask blocks while dynamically decoding subsequences based on model confidence.

Result: SDLM matches or surpasses autoregressive baselines using only 3.5M training samples, achieves 2.1× higher throughput than Qwen-2.5, and SDLM-32B shows even greater efficiency gains demonstrating strong scalability.

Conclusion: SDLM successfully unifies diffusion and autoregressive approaches, enabling efficient adaptive-length generation while maintaining KV-cache compatibility and demonstrating strong scalability potential.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have strong theoretical efficiency but are
limited by fixed-length decoding and incompatibility with key-value (KV)
caches. Block diffusion mitigates these issues, yet still enforces a fixed
block size and requires expensive training. We introduce Next Sequence
Prediction (NSP), which unifies next-token and next-block prediction, enabling
the model to adaptively determine the generation length at each step. When the
length is fixed to 1, NSP reduces to standard next-token prediction. Building
on NSP, we propose Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM), which can
retrofit pre-trained autoregressive language models (ALMs) at minimal cost.
Specifically, SDLM performs diffusion inference within fixed-size mask blocks,
but dynamically decodes consecutive subsequences based on model confidence,
thereby preserving KV-cache compatibility and improving robustness to varying
uncertainty and semantics across the sequence. Experiments show that SDLM
matches or surpasses strong autoregressive baselines using only 3.5M training
samples, while achieving 2.1 higher throughput than Qwen-2.5. Notably, the
SDLM-32B model delivers even more pronounced efficiency gains, demonstrating
the strong scalability potential of our modeling paradigm. Project page and

### [456] [SparseD: Sparse Attention for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24014)
*Zeqing Wang,Gongfan Fang,Xinyin Ma,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SparseD is a novel sparse attention method for diffusion language models that achieves lossless acceleration by leveraging head-specific sparse patterns and using full attention in early denoising steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source diffusion language models suffer from high inference latency due to attention's quadratic complexity, and sparse attention methods designed for autoregressive models are incompatible with DLMs due to different sparsity behaviors.

Method: SparseD pre-computes head-specific sparse patterns once and reuses them across all denoising steps, while using full attention in early critical steps and switching to sparse attention later to maintain generation quality.

Result: SparseD achieves up to 1.50× speedup over FlashAttention at 64k context length with 1,024 denoising steps while maintaining lossless acceleration.

Conclusion: SparseD provides a practical and efficient solution for deploying diffusion language models in long-context applications by addressing the unique sparsity challenges in DLMs.

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative to
autoregressive models (ARs), existing open-source DLMs suffer from high
inference latency. This bottleneck is mainly due to the attention's quadratic
complexity with respect to context length in computing all query-key pairs.
Intuitively, to reduce this complexity, a natural strategy is to restrict
attention to sparse patterns that retain only the most relevant connections.
Such approaches are well-established in ARs, where attention follows fixed and
clearly defined sparse patterns. However, in DLMs, we observe distinct sparsity
behaviors: (1) attention patterns vary across heads, (2) attention patterns in
each head remain highly similar across denoising steps, and (3) early denoising
steps are critical for generation. These findings render sparse attention
methods designed for ARs largely incompatible with DLMs, as they fail to
capture head-specific structures and risk degrading generation when applied in
early denoising steps. To address these challenges, we propose SparseD, a novel
sparse attention method for DLMs. Leveraging the observations, SparseD only
requires pre-computing head-specific sparse patterns one time, and reuses them
across all steps. This prevents recomputing sparse patterns at each denoising
step. Meanwhile, SparseD uses full attention in the early steps, then switches
to sparse attention later to maintain generation quality. Together, these
establish SparseD as a practical and efficient solution for deploying DLMs in
long-context applications. Experimental results demonstrate that SparseD
achieves lossless acceleration, delivering up to $1.50\times$ speedup over
FlashAttention at a 64k context length with 1,024 denoising steps.

*Hongbo Liu,Jia Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ResFormer is a novel neural architecture that combines reservoir computing for long-term dependencies and Transformers for short-term dependencies, achieving significant accuracy improvements with reduced memory consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models have quadratic complexity that limits input length, making it challenging to process extensive contexts efficiently despite their state-of-the-art performance.

Method: ResFormer uses a cascaded approach: reservoir computing with nonlinear readout for long-term dependencies in linear time, and conventional Transformers for short-term dependencies with fixed-length inputs.

Result: Outperforms DeepSeek-Qwen and ModernBERT by up to +22.3% accuracy on EmoryNLP dataset, with consistent gains on MultiWOZ, MELD, and IEMOCAP, while reducing memory consumption.

Conclusion: ResFormer effectively and efficiently models extensive contextual information by combining the strengths of reservoir computing and Transformers, overcoming limitations of pure Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Sequence classification is essential in NLP for understanding and
categorizing language patterns in tasks like sentiment analysis, intent
detection, and topic classification. Transformer-based models, despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance, have inherent limitations due to
quadratic time and memory complexity, restricting their input length. Although
extensive efforts have aimed at reducing computational demands, processing
extensive contexts remains challenging.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose ResFormer, a novel neural network
architecture designed to model varying context lengths efficiently through a
cascaded methodology. ResFormer integrates an reservoir computing network
featuring a nonlinear readout to effectively capture long-term contextual
dependencies in linear time. Concurrently, short-term dependencies within
sentences are modeled using a conventional Transformer architecture with
fixed-length inputs.
  Experiments demonstrate that ResFormer significantly outperforms baseline
models of DeepSeek-Qwen and ModernBERT, delivering an accuracy improvement of
up to +22.3% on the EmoryNLP dataset and consistent gains on MultiWOZ, MELD,
and IEMOCAP. In addition, ResFormer exhibits reduced memory consumption,
underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency in modeling extensive contextual
information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes transformer ensemble and LLM methods for cross-lingual sentiment analysis when labeled data is unavailable in target languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentiment analysis faces challenges in foreign languages without labeled training data, limiting its application across diverse languages and industries.

Method: Used transformer ensemble model combining bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment and XLM-R, along with large language models, applied to multi-language datasets.

Result: Achieved over 86% sentiment analysis performance using the proposed ensemble approach.

Conclusion: Transformer ensemble models effectively address cross-lingual sentiment analysis challenges when labeled data is unavailable.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a very important natural language processing activity
in which one identifies the polarity of a text, whether it conveys positive,
negative, or neutral sentiment. Along with the growth of social media and the
Internet, the significance of sentiment analysis has grown across numerous
industries such as marketing, politics, and customer service. Sentiment
analysis is flawed, however, when applied to foreign languages, particularly
when there is no labelled data to train models upon. In this study, we present
a transformer ensemble model and a large language model (LLM) that employs
sentiment analysis of other languages. We used multi languages dataset.
Sentiment was then assessed for sentences using an ensemble of pre-trained
sentiment analysis models: bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment, and XLM-R.
Our experimental results indicated that sentiment analysis performance was more
than 86% using the proposed method.

*Matteo Boffa,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Large-Scale Constraint Generation (LSCG) to test LLMs' ability to handle many fine-grained constraints, proposes Words Checker as a practical test, and presents FoCusNet to improve performance by filtering constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if LLMs can parse and handle large, fine-grained constraint lists, moving beyond few explicit requirements to more complex constraint scenarios.

Method: Created Words Checker benchmark, tested model characteristics and steering techniques, and proposed FoCusNet - a small model that filters constraints to help LLMs focus on relevant ones.

Result: Existing solutions show significant performance drops with increasing constraints, while FoCusNet provides 8-13% accuracy improvement.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle with large constraint sets, but dedicated constraint filtering models like FoCusNet can significantly boost performance by helping LLMs focus on relevant constraints.

Abstract: Recent research has explored the constrained generation capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) when explicitly prompted by few task-specific
requirements. In contrast, we introduce Large-Scale Constraint Generation
(LSCG), a new problem that evaluates whether LLMs can parse a large,
fine-grained, generic list of constraints. To examine the LLMs' ability to
handle an increasing number constraints, we create a practical instance of
LSCG, called Words Checker. In Words Checker, we evaluate the impact of model
characteristics (e.g., size, family) and steering techniques (e.g., Simple
Prompt, Chain of Thought, Best of N) on performance. We also propose FoCusNet,
a small and dedicated model that parses the original list of constraints into a
smaller subset, helping the LLM focus on relevant constraints. Experiments
reveal that existing solutions suffer a significant performance drop as the
number of constraints increases, with FoCusNet showing an 8-13% accuracy boost.

*Kaiyu He,Peilin Wu,Mian Zhang,Kun Wan,Wentian Zhao,Xinya Du,Zhiyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GEAR is a novel evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' abductive reasoning capabilities through automated scoring of hypothesis sets based on consistency, generalizability, and diversity, without requiring human gold answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating whether LLMs can discover new knowledge through abductive reasoning (generating plausible hypotheses), rather than just instruction following and deductive reasoning.

Method: GEAR evaluates hypothesis sets using three metrics: consistency (explains observations), generalizability (makes meaningful predictions on unseen inputs), and diversity (covers distinct patterns). Also proposes a momentum-based curriculum that adjusts training data based on learning velocity.

Result: Evaluation of nine LLMs on four abduction benchmarks with 1,500 problems, generating over 50,000 hypotheses. The momentum-based curriculum improved all GEAR objectives and transferred gains to established benchmarks without gold-label supervision.

Conclusion: GEAR provides a principled framework for evaluating abduction and supplies label-free, scalable training signals that help LLMs produce more diverse and reliable hypotheses.

Abstract: Since the advent of large language models (LLMs), research has focused on
instruction following and deductive reasoning. A central question remains: can
these models discover new knowledge, and how can we evaluate this ability? We
address this by studying abductive reasoning-the generation of plausible
hypotheses to explain observations-and introduce GEAR (General Evaluation for
Abductive Reasoning), a general-purpose, fully automated, transparent, and
label-free evaluation paradigm. GEAR scores hypothesis sets by three metrics:
consistency (each hypothesis explains the observations), generalizability
(consistent hypotheses make meaningful predictions on unseen inputs), and
diversity (the set covers distinct predictions and patterns). Built this way,
GEAR is scalable (no human gold answers), reliable (deterministic scoring
aligned with classical abduction), and open-ended (scores improve only when
models produce new plausible hypotheses, unlike static benchmarks that saturate
once accuracy is high). Using GEAR, we conduct a fine-grained study of nine
LLMs on four abduction benchmarks with 1,500 problems, generating over 50,000
candidate hypotheses and revealing model differences obscured by gold-answer or
purely human evaluations. We further propose a momentum-based curriculum that
adjusts GEAR-derived training data by learning velocity: it starts with what
the model learns quickly and shifts toward harder objectives such as generating
diverse hypotheses once the model is confident on foundational objectives.
Without gold-label supervision, this strategy improves all GEAR objectives and
these gains transfer to established abductive reasoning benchmarks. Taken
together, GEAR provides a principled framework that evaluates abduction and
supplies label-free, scalable training signals that help LLMs produce more
diverse and reliable hypotheses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BTC-SAM is a framework that uses Large Language Models to generate diverse test cases for identifying social biases in Sentiment Analysis models, reducing the need for expensive manual sentence creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentiment Analysis models contain harmful social biases, but creating comprehensive test sentences to identify these biases is expensive and requires domain expertise or crowd-sourcing.

Method: Uses Large Language Models for controllable generation of test sentences, providing high linguistic variation and diversity compared to base prompting methods.

Result: BTC-SAM generates high-quality test cases with better linguistic variation and diversity, offering improved test coverage even for previously unseen biases.

Conclusion: LLM-based generation provides an effective solution for comprehensive bias testing in Sentiment Analysis models, overcoming the limitations of manual test case creation.

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis (SA) models harbor inherent social biases that can be
harmful in real-world applications. These biases are identified by examining
the output of SA models for sentences that only vary in the identity groups of
the subjects. Constructing natural, linguistically rich, relevant, and diverse
sets of sentences that provide sufficient coverage over the domain is
expensive, especially when addressing a wide range of biases: it requires
domain experts and/or crowd-sourcing. In this paper, we present a novel bias
testing framework, BTC-SAM, which generates high-quality test cases for bias
testing in SA models with minimal specification using Large Language Models
(LLMs) for the controllable generation of test sentences. Our experiments show
that relying on LLMs can provide high linguistic variation and diversity in the
test sentences, thereby offering better test coverage compared to base
prompting methods even for previously unseen biases.

*Guangliang Liu,Xi Chen,Bocheng Chen,Xitong Zhang,Kristen Johnson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving generalized moral reasoning in LLMs by bridging the gap between distributional semantics and pragmatic-level moral understanding through moral foundations theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with generalized moral reasoning because they operate on distributional semantics while morals function at the pragmatic level, creating a fundamental gap that limits their reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposed pragmatic inference methods based on moral foundations theory that leverage contextual information at each step to connect moral foundations with moral reasoning objectives.

Result: Experimental results show the approach significantly enhances LLMs' generalization in moral reasoning.

Conclusion: The method provides a foundation for future research in moral reasoning grounded in moral foundations theory.

Abstract: Moral reasoning has emerged as a promising research direction for Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet achieving generalization remains a central
challenge. From a linguistic standpoint, this difficulty arises because LLMs
are adept at capturing distributional semantics, which fundamentally differs
from the morals which operate at the pragmatic level. This paper investigates
how LLMs can achieve generalized moral reasoning despite their reliance on
distributional semantics. We propose pragmatic inference methods grounded in
moral foundations theory, which leverage contextual information at each step to
bridge the pragmatic gap and guide LLMs in connecting moral foundations with
moral reasoning objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances LLMs' generalization in moral reasoning, providing a
foundation for future research grounded in moral foundations theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents struggle with hard-exploration tasks that require learning new knowledge through exploration, particularly in complex environments like text-based games.

Method: Uses dual-scale world models with a trajectory frontier at global scale and local trial-and-error exploration through Multi-path Advantage Reflection mechanism that infers advantage-based progress signals.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance for LLM-based approaches on Jericho benchmark suite, with comparable performance to RL methods but requiring 100-800x fewer environment interactions.

Conclusion: GLoW demonstrates that LLM-based agents can effectively tackle hard-exploration tasks through strategic exploration mechanisms, offering significant efficiency improvements over traditional RL approaches.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have seen promising advances, yet they are still limited in
"hard-exploration" tasks requiring learning new knowledge through exploration.
We present GLoW, a novel approach leveraging dual-scale world models,
maintaining a trajectory frontier of high-value discoveries at the global
scale, while learning from local trial-and-error in exploration through a
Multi-path Advantage Reflection mechanism which infers advantage-based progress
signals to guide exploration. To evaluate our framework for hard-exploration,
we tackle the Jericho benchmark suite of text-based games, where GLoW achieves
a new state-of-theart performance for LLM-based approaches. Compared to
state-of-the-art RLbased methods, our approach achieves comparable performance
while requiring 100-800x fewer environment interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TARE and ATARE frameworks for robust prompt optimization that minimize textual sharpness in LLMs, ensuring prompt performance remains stable under semantically equivalent paraphrases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt optimization methods focus only on point-wise accuracy and fail to address the brittleness of LLMs where small paraphrases cause large performance swings, highlighting the need for robustness against textual sharpness.

Method: Proposes TARE (Textual Sharpness-Aware Evolving) - a derivative-free framework with inner adversarial search using hard paraphrases and outer robust selection. ATARE extends this with anisotropic weights to shape semantic neighborhoods and adaptive radius balancing.

Result: The methods outperform accuracy-only prompt search by preserving accuracy under paraphrasing while remaining computationally practical across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: Minimizing textual sharpness gap leads to robust prompts that maintain performance under semantic variations, addressing a key limitation of current prompt optimization approaches.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on carefully
engineered prompts. However, prevailing prompt optimization methods, ranging
from heuristic edits and reinforcement learning to evolutionary search,
primarily target point-wise accuracy. They seldom enforce paraphrase invariance
or searching stability, and therefore cannot remedy this brittleness in
practice. Automated prompt search remains brittle: small, semantically
preserving paraphrases often cause large performance swings. We identify this
brittleness as the textual sharpness of the prompt landscape. In this work, we
provide the first formal treatment of textual sharpness in the discrete,
semantic space of prompts, together with an operational robustness criterion
over a semantic neighborhood; the design is black-box or API-only, requiring no
gradients to update the model's parameters. Then we introduce TARE (Textual
Sharpness-Aware Evolving), a derivative-free framework that alternates between
an inner, sampling-based adversarial search that stresses a prompt with hard
paraphrases and an outer, robust selection that prefers candidates whose
neighborhoods remain strong. We further propose ATARE, which learns anisotropic
weights to shape the semantic neighborhood and adapts its radius over time to
balance exploration and fidelity. Diverse tasks evaluate our methods, whose
design for minimizing textual sharpness gap leads to prompts that preserve
accuracy under paraphrasing, outperforming accuracy-only prompt search while
remaining computationally practical.

TL;DR: LOT is a method that uses language models to compare reasoning traces from different large reasoning models and create a human-readable taxonomy of their distinctive thinking patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current comparisons of large reasoning models focus only on macro-level statistics like accuracy, leaving the question of whether different models actually reason differently unanswered.

Method: LOT uses a generative language model to compare reasoning traces from two LRMs, articulate their distinctive features in words, and model how these features predict the source model based on empirical distributions across outputs.

Result: Applied to 12 open-source LRMs on math, science, and coding tasks, LOT achieved 80-100% accuracy in distinguishing reasoning traces from models differing in scale, family, or domain. It also improved smaller Qwen3 models' accuracy on GPQA by 3.3-5.7% when aligning their reasoning style with the largest Qwen3.

Conclusion: LOT provides both quantitative classification and qualitative explanations of how different large reasoning models think, revealing systematic differences in reasoning patterns that can be leveraged to improve model performance.

Abstract: Current comparisons of large reasoning models (LRMs) focus on macro-level
statistics such as task accuracy or reasoning length. Whether different LRMs
reason differently remains an open question. To address this gap, we introduce
the LLM-proposed Open Taxonomy (LOT), a classification method that uses a
generative language model to compare reasoning traces from two LRMs and
articulate their distinctive features in words. LOT then models how these
features predict the source LRM of a reasoning trace based on their empirical
distributions across LRM outputs. Iterating this process over a dataset of
reasoning traces yields a human-readable taxonomy that characterizes how models
think. We apply LOT to compare the reasoning of 12 open-source LRMs on tasks in
math, science, and coding. LOT identifies systematic differences in their
thoughts, achieving 80-100% accuracy in distinguishing reasoning traces from
LRMs that differ in scale, base model family, or objective domain. Beyond
classification, LOT's natural-language taxonomy provides qualitative
explanations of how LRMs think differently. Finally, in a case study, we link
the reasoning differences to performance: aligning the reasoning style of
smaller Qwen3 models with that of the largest Qwen3 during test time improves
their accuracy on GPQA by 3.3-5.7%.

*Haolin Yang,Hakaze Cho,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Task Subspace Logit Attribution (TSLA) framework to analyze in-context learning mechanisms in LLMs, identifying specialized attention heads for Task Recognition (TR) and Task Learning (TL) that work complementarily.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile two dominant perspectives on in-context learning: component-level analysis of attention heads and holistic decomposition into TR and TL components, providing a unified understanding of ICL mechanisms.

Method: Developed TSLA framework to identify TR and TL specialized attention heads, conducted correlation analysis, ablation studies, input perturbations, and steering experiments with geometric analysis of hidden states.

Result: TR heads align hidden states with task subspace for task recognition, while TL heads rotate hidden states within subspace toward correct labels for prediction. The framework reconciles previous findings like induction heads and task vectors.

Conclusion: The TSLA framework provides a unified and interpretable account of how large language models execute in-context learning across diverse tasks and settings by decomposing ICL into complementary TR and TL mechanisms.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of in-context learning (ICL) in
large language models by reconciling two dominant perspectives: the
component-level analysis of attention heads and the holistic decomposition of
ICL into Task Recognition (TR) and Task Learning (TL). We propose a novel
framework based on Task Subspace Logit Attribution (TSLA) to identify attention
heads specialized in TR and TL, and demonstrate their distinct yet
complementary roles. Through correlation analysis, ablation studies, and input
perturbations, we show that the identified TR and TL heads independently and
effectively capture the TR and TL components of ICL. Using steering experiments
with geometric analysis of hidden states, we reveal that TR heads promote task
recognition by aligning hidden states with the task subspace, while TL heads
rotate hidden states within the subspace toward the correct label to facilitate
prediction. We further show how previous findings on ICL mechanisms, including
induction heads and task vectors, can be reconciled with our
attention-head-level analysis of the TR-TL decomposition. Our framework thus
provides a unified and interpretable account of how large language models
execute ICL across diverse tasks and settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Learned Task Vectors (LTVs) as a more effective alternative to extracted task vectors for in-context learning, and provides mechanistic analysis of how task vectors influence transformer computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for extracting task vectors from LLMs are cumbersome, opaque, and don't elucidate the mechanisms by which task vectors influence computation. The authors aim to address both the practical limitation of obtaining effective task vectors and the theoretical gap in understanding their mechanistic role.

Method: Propose directly training Learned Task Vectors (LTVs) instead of extracting them from model outputs/hidden states. Conduct systematic analysis to investigate how task vectors mechanistically influence transformer computations through attention-head OV circuits and linear propagation patterns.

Result: LTVs surpass extracted task vectors in accuracy and exhibit superior flexibility - they work effectively at arbitrary layers, positions, and with ICL prompts. Analysis reveals task vectors primarily steer predictions through attention-head OV circuits, with a small subset of "key heads" being most decisive. TV propagation is largely linear despite transformer nonlinearities.

Conclusion: LTVs provide both a practical approach for obtaining effective task vectors and a principled lens into the mechanistic foundations of in-context learning, revealing linear propagation patterns and key attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform new tasks from in-context
demonstrations, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent work
suggests that these demonstrations are compressed into task vectors (TVs),
compact task representations that LLMs exploit for predictions. However, prior
studies typically extract TVs from model outputs or hidden states using
cumbersome and opaque methods, and they rarely elucidate the mechanisms by
which TVs influence computation. In this work, we address both limitations.
First, we propose directly training Learned Task Vectors (LTVs), which surpass
extracted TVs in accuracy and exhibit superior flexibility-acting effectively
at arbitrary layers, positions, and even with ICL prompts. Second, through
systematic analysis, we investigate the mechanistic role of TVs, showing that
at the low level they steer predictions primarily through attention-head OV
circuits, with a small subset of "key heads" most decisive. At a higher level,
we find that despite Transformer nonlinearities, TV propagation is largely
linear: early TVs are rotated toward task-relevant subspaces to improve logits
of relevant labels, while later TVs are predominantly scaled in magnitude.
Taken together, LTVs not only provide a practical approach for obtaining
effective TVs but also offer a principled lens into the mechanistic foundations
of ICL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents using VLMs face limitations due to scarce training data and the complexity of real-world tasks that require knowledge of rare, unseen scenarios.

Method: Proposes RAG-GUI, a model-agnostic VLM that uses web tutorials at inference time, warm-started via supervised finetuning and refined through self-guided rejection sampling finetuning.

Result: Outperforms baseline agents and other inference baselines by 2.6% to 13.3% across two model sizes, demonstrating strong generalization and plug-and-play capabilities.

Conclusion: RAG-GUI effectively enhances VLM-based GUI agents for complex digital tasks by leveraging external knowledge sources and specialized finetuning techniques.

Abstract: GUI agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in
automating complex digital tasks. However, their effectiveness in real-world
applications is often limited by scarce training data and the inherent
complexity of these tasks, which frequently require long-tailed knowledge
covering rare, unseen scenarios. We propose RAG-GUI , a lightweight VLM that
leverages web tutorials at inference time. RAG-GUI is first warm-started via
supervised finetuning (SFT) and further refined through self-guided rejection
sampling finetuning (RSF). Designed to be model-agnostic, RAG-GUI functions as
a generic plug-in that enhances any VLM-based agent. Evaluated across three
distinct tasks, it consistently outperforms baseline agents and surpasses other
inference baselines by 2.6% to 13.3% across two model sizes, demonstrating
strong generalization and practical plug-and-play capabilities in real-world
scenarios.

*Zhimeng Luo,Lixin Wu,Adam Frisch,Daqing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedIRT introduces an Item Response Theory-based framework for evaluating LLMs in medical applications, revealing nuanced ability profiles and specialized competencies that traditional accuracy metrics miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional accuracy metrics are inadequate for evaluating LLMs in high-stakes medical applications as they don't capture question characteristics or provide topic-specific insights.

Method: Used Item Response Theory with one unidimensional two-parameter logistic IRT model per topic, prospectively gathering responses from 80 diverse LLMs on a 1,100-question USMLE-aligned benchmark.

Result: Identified distinctive "spiky" ability profiles where overall rankings can be misleading; GPT-5 was top in 8 of 11 domains but outperformed by Claude-3-opus in Social Science and Communication; IRT also helped identify flawed questions in benchmarks.

Conclusion: Establishes a robust, psychometrically grounded methodology essential for safe and effective deployment of LLMs in healthcare, providing a practical decision-support framework that integrates multi-factor competency profiles with operational metrics.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for high-stakes
medical applications, there has emerged a critical need for reliable and
accurate evaluation methodologies. Traditional accuracy metrics fail
inadequately as they neither capture question characteristics nor offer
topic-specific insights. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{MedIRT}, a
rigorous evaluation framework grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT), the gold
standard in high-stakes educational testing. Unlike previous research relying
on archival data, we prospectively gathered fresh responses from 80 diverse
LLMs on a balanced, 1,100-question USMLE-aligned benchmark. Using one
unidimensional two-parameter logistic IRT model per topic, we estimate LLM's
latent model ability jointly with question difficulty and discrimination,
yielding more stable and nuanced performance rankings than accuracy alone.
Notably, we identify distinctive ``spiky'' ability profiles, where overall
rankings can be misleading due to highly specialized model abilities. While
\texttt{GPT-5} was the top performer in a majority of domains (8 of 11), it was
outperformed in Social Science and Communication by \texttt{Claude-3-opus},
demonstrating that even an overall 23rd-ranked model can hold the top spot for
specific competencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate IRT's utility in auditing
benchmarks by identifying flawed questions. We synthesize these findings into a
practical decision-support framework that integrates our multi-factor
competency profiles with operational metrics. This work establishes a robust,
psychometrically grounded methodology essential for the safe, effective, and
trustworthy deployment of LLMs in healthcare.

*Luyang Zhang,Siyuan Peng,Jialu Wang,Shichao Zhu,Beibei Li,Zhongcun Wang,Guangmou Pan,Yan Li,Song Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PET framework reframes user preference modeling from direct item generation to inferring dynamic probability distributions over interpretable preference clusters, improving ranking quality and addressing limitations of opaque LLM-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based approaches for user preference prediction are effective for short-term prediction but limit personalization due to opaque decision-making, obscure holistic user profiling, and exacerbate popularity bias.

Method: Proposes Preference Evolution Tracking (PET) framework that uses logit-probing and generative classification techniques to infer user preferences as probability distributions over a stable lattice of preference clusters.

Result: PET improves ranking quality by up to 40% in NDCG on public benchmarks (Yelp, MovieLens) and outperforms a SOTA production model by 7 times in NDCG score on a large-scale short-video platform dataset, excelling at ranking long-tail content.

Conclusion: PET transforms user profile modeling from direct preference list generation to transparent distributional preference mapping, enabling more explainable, fair, and diverse personalization systems.

Abstract: Understanding how user preference evolves over time is a fundamental
challenge central to modern digital ecosystems, for which Large Language Models
(LLMs) are an increasingly prominent and popular approach due to their ability
to comprehend the rich semantic context within behavioral data. A common
practice is to use LLMs to predict a user's next action by directly generating
a ranked list of preferred items. Although effective for short-term prediction,
the end-to-end generation paradigm inherently limits personalization. Its
opaque decision-making process obscures holistic user profiling and exacerbates
popularity bias. To address these limitations, we propose Preference Evolution
Tracking (PET), a framework that reframes the task as inferring a dynamic
probability distribution over a stable and interpretable lattice of preference
clusters. By applying logit-probing and generative classification techniques,
PET infers a user's preference as a probability distribution, enabling
transparent preference learning. On public benchmarks (Yelp, MovieLens), PET
improves ranking quality by up to 40% in NDCG over direct generation baselines.
On a large-scale, real-world dataset from a short-video platform, it excels at
ranking long-tail contents, significantly outperforming a SOTA production model
by 7 times in the NDCG score. Ultimately, PET transforms the user profile model
from direct preference list generation to a transparent distributional
preference mapping, paving the way for more explainable, fair, and diverse
personalization systems.

*Ran Xu,Yuchen Zhuang,Zihan Dong,Jonathan Wang,Yue Yu,Joyce C. Ho,Linjun Zhang,Haoyu Wang,Wenqi Shi,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AceSearcher is a cooperative self-play framework that trains a single LLM to alternate between decomposing complex queries and solving them with retrieved contexts, achieving superior performance on reasoning tasks with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Search-augmented LLMs struggle with complex reasoning due to ineffective multi-hop retrieval and limited reasoning ability, requiring a more effective approach for handling complex queries.

Method: A cooperative self-play framework that trains one LLM to alternate between decomposer (breaking down queries) and solver (integrating contexts) roles, using supervised fine-tuning on diverse tasks and reinforcement fine-tuning optimized for answer accuracy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with 7.6% average exact match improvement, matches DeepSeek-V3 performance with <5% parameters on finance tasks, and surpasses larger models with up to 9x more parameters.

Conclusion: AceSearcher demonstrates exceptional efficiency and effectiveness in complex reasoning tasks through its cooperative self-play approach, eliminating the need for intermediate annotations while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Search-augmented LLMs often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to
ineffective multi-hop retrieval and limited reasoning ability. We propose
AceSearcher, a cooperative self-play framework that trains a single large
language model (LLM) to alternate between two roles: a decomposer that breaks
down complex queries and a solver that integrates retrieved contexts for answer
generation. AceSearcher couples supervised fine-tuning on a diverse mixture of
search, reasoning, and decomposition tasks with reinforcement fine-tuning
optimized for final answer accuracy, eliminating the need for intermediate
annotations. Extensive experiments on three reasoning-intensive tasks across 10
datasets show that AceSearcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average exact match improvement of 7.6%. Remarkably, on
document-level finance reasoning tasks, AceSearcher-32B matches the performance
of the DeepSeek-V3 model using less than 5% of its parameters. Even at smaller
scales (1.5B and 8B), AceSearcher often surpasses existing search-augmented
LLMs with up to 9x more parameters, highlighting its exceptional efficiency and
effectiveness in tackling complex reasoning tasks. Our code will be published

### [473] [Can Large Language Models Express Uncertainty Like Human?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24202)
*Linwei Tao,Yi-Fan Yeh,Bo Kai,Minjing Dong,Tao Huang,Tom A. Lamb,Jialin Yu,Philip H. S. Torr,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes using linguistic confidence (hedging language like "probably") as a lightweight alternative to numerical uncertainty estimation in LLMs, addressing practical barriers of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing confidence estimation methods face practical issues: hidden logits, computational expense of multi-sampling, and unnatural numerical uncertainty expressions. Linguistic confidence offers a human-centered, efficient alternative.

Method: Created a large-scale dataset of hedging expressions with human-annotated confidence scores, developed a lightweight mapper to convert hedges to confidence scores, systematically studied LC across LLMs and benchmarks, and introduced a fine-tuning framework for improvement.

Result: Most LLMs underperform in expressing reliable linguistic confidence, but carefully designed prompting achieves competitive calibration and discriminability. Fine-tuning further improves LC reliability.

Conclusion: Linguistic confidence is a scalable, efficient, and human-aligned approach to LLM uncertainty estimation that deserves deeper exploration as a promising alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where overconfident responses can mislead users. Reliable confidence estimation
has been shown to enhance trust and task accuracy. Yet existing methods face
practical barriers: logits are often hidden, multi-sampling is computationally
expensive, and verbalized numerical uncertainty (e.g., giving a 0-100 score)
deviates from natural communication. We revisit linguistic confidence (LC),
where models express uncertainty through hedging language (e.g., probably,
might), offering a lightweight and human-centered alternative. To advance this
direction, we (1) release the first diverse, large-scale dataset of hedging
expressions with human-annotated confidence scores, and (2) propose a
lightweight mapper that converts hedges into confidence scores at near-zero
cost. Building on these resources, we (3) conduct the first systematic study of
LC across modern LLMs and QA benchmarks, revealing that while most LLMs
underperform in expressing reliable LC, carefully designed prompting achieves
competitive calibration and discriminability. Finally, we (4) introduce a
fine-tuning framework that further improves LC reliability. Taken together, our
work positions linguistic confidence as a scalable, efficient, and
human-aligned approach to LLM uncertainty estimation, and calls for deeper
exploration of this promising yet underexplored direction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BeyondBench is a novel evaluation framework that uses algorithmic problem generation to avoid benchmark contamination issues, testing 101 language models across 44 algorithmic tasks with varying difficulty levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional benchmarks risk contamination from internet training data, making it unclear whether models are reasoning or just recalling answers. This creates a need for fresh, uncontaminated evaluation methods.

Method: The framework generates algorithmic problems on the fly from a combinatorial space larger than 10^15 unique instances, covering 44 tasks with 117 variations across Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty suites. Solutions are verified deterministically by mathematical proofs.

Result: Evaluation of 101 models showed consistent reasoning deficiencies, with performance degrading sharply as complexity increases. In the Hard Suite, top models achieved 26-56% accuracy, and performance dropped drastically without tool usage (16-48% decline).

Conclusion: BeyondBench provides a contamination-free evaluation method that reveals significant reasoning limitations in current language models, especially for complex algorithmic problems, highlighting the need for improved reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Evaluating language models fairly is becoming harder as static benchmarks
available on the internet risk contamination by training data. This makes it
unclear whether models are truly reasoning or just recalling answers. In this
paper, we introduce BeyondBench, an evaluation framework that avoids this
problem by using algorithmic problem generation. Unlike traditional benchmarks
that risk contamination from internet-scale training data, BeyondBench creates
mathematically grounded problems on the fly, ensuring each test remains fresh
and uncontaminated. Our framework covers 44 algorithmic tasks with a total of
117 variations, grouped into three difficulty levels: the Easy Suite (29 tasks)
for basic arithmetic and statistics, the Medium Suite (5 tasks, 49 variations)
for sequence patterns and reasoning, and the Hard Suite (10 tasks, 68
variations) tackling NP-complete and constraint satisfaction problems. Each
task generates problems from a combinatorial space larger than 10^15 unique
instances, with solutions verified deterministically by mathematical proofs. We
evaluated 101 language models, including 85 open-source and 16 closed-source
models, spanning sizes from 0.5B to 141B parameters and multiple quantization
schemes. Our results show consistent reasoning deficiencies across model
families, with performance degrading sharply as problem complexity increases
from polynomial to exponential. In our Hard Suite evaluations, models such as
Gemini-2.5-pro, Llama-3.3-70B, and Qwen2.5-72B achieved average accuracies of
56.38%, 26.91%, and 33.60%, respectively. Moreover, we observe that performance
drops drastically without tool usage, with GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5-nano
showing a decline of 16.81%, 28.05%, and 47.59% accuracy on the hard suite. Our
leaderboard is publicly available at https://ctrl-gaurav.github.io/BeyondBench/

### [475] [ScenarioBench: Trace-Grounded Compliance Evaluation for Text-to-SQL and RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24212)
*Zahra Atf,Peter R Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ScenarioBench is a benchmark for evaluating Text-to-SQL and RAG systems in compliance contexts, focusing on policy-grounded decision-making with traceable justifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-SQL and RAG benchmarks lack rigorous evaluation of justification quality and policy compliance, particularly in scenarios requiring traceable evidence and audit-ready explanations.

Method: Uses YAML scenarios with no-peek gold standards including expected decisions, witness traces, governing clauses, and canonical SQL. Systems must justify outputs using clause IDs from policy canon.

Result: Provides comprehensive evaluation metrics: decision accuracy, trace quality, retrieval effectiveness, SQL correctness, policy coverage, latency, and explanation-hallucination rate. Introduces Scenario Difficulty Index (SDI) and budgeted variant (SDI-R).

Conclusion: ScenarioBench shifts evaluation focus toward justification quality under explicit time constraints, making explanations falsifiable and audit-ready, addressing limitations of prior benchmarks.

Abstract: ScenarioBench is a policy-grounded, trace-aware benchmark for evaluating
Text-to-SQL and retrieval-augmented generation in compliance contexts. Each
YAML scenario includes a no-peek gold-standard package with the expected
decision, a minimal witness trace, the governing clause set, and the canonical
SQL, enabling end-to-end scoring of both what a system decides and why. Systems
must justify outputs using clause IDs from the same policy canon, making
explanations falsifiable and audit-ready. The evaluator reports decision
accuracy, trace quality (completeness, correctness, order), retrieval
effectiveness, SQL correctness via result-set equivalence, policy coverage,
latency, and an explanation-hallucination rate. A normalized Scenario
Difficulty Index (SDI) and a budgeted variant (SDI-R) aggregate results while
accounting for retrieval difficulty and time. Compared with prior Text-to-SQL
or KILT/RAG benchmarks, ScenarioBench ties each decision to clause-level
evidence under strict grounding and no-peek rules, shifting gains toward
justification quality under explicit time budgets.

Motivation: Researchers face difficulty navigating diverse theoretical frameworks and data for analyzing morals and values in language communication.

Method: Developed MoVa with 16 labeled datasets from four frameworks, a lightweight LLM prompting strategy called all@once that scores all related concepts simultaneously, and a survey evaluation application.

Result: The LLM prompting strategy outperforms fine-tuned models across multiple domains and frameworks.

Conclusion: MoVa facilitates fine-grained interpretations of human and machine communication with implications for machine behavior alignment.

Abstract: Identifying human morals and values embedded in language is essential to
empirical studies of communication. However, researchers often face substantial
difficulty navigating the diversity of theoretical frameworks and data
available for their analysis. Here, we contribute MoVa, a well-documented suite
of resources for generalizable classification of human morals and values,
consisting of (1) 16 labeled datasets and benchmarking results from four
theoretically-grounded frameworks; (2) a lightweight LLM prompting strategy
that outperforms fine-tuned models across multiple domains and frameworks; and
(3) a new application that helps evaluate psychological surveys. In practice,
we specifically recommend a classification strategy, all@once, that scores all
related concepts simultaneously, resembling the well-known multi-label
classifier chain. The data and methods in MoVa can facilitate many fine-grained
interpretations of human and machine communication, with potential implications
for the alignment of machine behavior.

Result: Achieved first place in Task 1 and Task 3, and second place in Task 2 of the GPU track.

Conclusion: The approach combining Qwen3-14B with specialized LoRA adapters and MultiLoRA inference proved effective for building in-game conversational AI that meets competition requirements while considering resource constraints.

Abstract: This paper presents the opdainlp team's solution for the GPU track of the
CPDC 2025 challenge. The challenge consists of three tasks, aiming to build an
in-game conversational AI that adheres to character personas, aligns with the
game's worldview, and supports function calling. Considering both effectiveness
and resource/time constraints during inference, we synthesized data for some of
the tasks based on the datasets provided by the competition organizers. We
employed Qwen3-14B with LoRA fine-tuning and model fusion, and utilized a base
model integrated with multiple LoRA adapters during inference. Specifically, in
the competition, we used three distinct LoRA adapters to handle tool calling,
response generation with tool call results, and response generation without
tool call results, respectively. MultiLoRA inference was implemented using
vLLM. Our solution achieved the first place in Task 1 and Task 3, and the
second place in Task 2 of the GPU track.

TL;DR: MetaTuner is a framework that jointly optimizes prompts and fine-tunes parameters for LLMs, enabling synergistic improvement through knowledge sharing between discrete prompt generation and continuous parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work has studied prompt optimization and fine-tuning in isolation, leaving their synergistic potential largely underexplored. The authors aim to bridge this gap by integrating both approaches.

Method: Introduces MetaTuner with two neural networks for prompt generation and parameter updates, sharing a common encoding layer. Uses supervised regularization loss to handle the discrete-continuous optimization challenge.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that MetaTuner consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Conclusion: Joint integration of prompt optimization and fine-tuning through MetaTuner framework demonstrates superior performance compared to isolated approaches, effectively leveraging their complementary strengths.

Abstract: Prompt optimization and fine-tuning are two major approaches to improve the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). They enhance the capabilities of
LLMs from complementary perspectives: the former through explicit natural
language, and the latter through implicit parameter updates. However, prior
work has typically studied them in isolation, leaving their synergistic
potential largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we
introduce MetaTuner, a novel framework that jointly integrates prompt
optimization and fine-tuning for LLM training. Specifically, we introduce two
neural networks to generate prompts and parameters, respectively, while
allowing them to share a common bottom encoding layer to enable knowledge
sharing. By the guidance of the final supervised signals, our framework is
optimized to discover the optimal combinations between the prompts and
parameters. Given that prompt learning involves discrete optimization while
fine-tuning operates in a continuous parameter space, we design a supervised
regularization loss to train our framework effectively. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms the
baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SimuHome is a time-accelerated smart home simulator built on Matter protocol that enables realistic testing of LLM agents for smart home tasks, revealing significant challenges in latent intent inference, state verification, and temporal scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of realistic simulation environments and challenging benchmarks for developing smart home agents that can handle latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, and scheduling.

Method: Built SimuHome - a time-accelerated home environment simulating smart devices, supporting API calls, and reflecting environmental changes based on the Matter protocol standard. Created a benchmark of 600 episodes across 12 user query types requiring complex capabilities.

Result: Evaluation of 11 agents showed they struggle with latent intent inference, state verification, and temporal scheduling. Even the top-performing GPT-4.1 achieved only 54% success rate, highlighting significant performance gaps.

Conclusion: There is a critical need for methods that can reliably verify current state via tools before acting and coordinate time-dependent actions, as current LLM agents face substantial challenges in smart home applications.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at multi-step, tool-augmented tasks.
However, smart homes introduce distinct challenges, requiring agents to handle
latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, scheduling, and
more. The main bottlenecks for developing smart home agents with such
capabilities include the lack of a realistic simulation environment where
agents can interact with devices and observe the results, as well as a
challenging benchmark to evaluate them. To address this, we introduce
$\textbf{SimuHome}$, a time-accelerated home environment that simulates smart
devices, supports API calls, and reflects changes in environmental variables.
By building the simulator on the Matter protocol (the global industry standard
for smart home communication), SimuHome provides a high-fidelity environment,
and agents validated in SimuHome can be deployed on real Matter-compliant
devices with minimal adaptation. We provide a challenging benchmark of 600
episodes across twelve user query types that require the aforementioned
capabilities. Our evaluation of 11 agents under a unified ReAct framework
reveals that while models perform well on simple tasks, they struggle with
latent intent inference, state verification, and especially temporal
scheduling. Even the top-performing model, GPT-4.1, reaches only 54% success
rate. These findings highlight a critical need for methods that can reliably
verify the current state via tools before acting and coordinate time-dependent
actions.

TL;DR: GIRCSE introduces a generative iterative refinement framework for sentence embeddings that leverages autoregressive generation to produce better semantic representations than encoder-only LLM approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based embeddings treat LLMs as static feature extractors and overlook their core generative capabilities, missing latent concepts and implicit semantics.

Method: Uses autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic representations through sequences of soft tokens optimized under an Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective.

Result: Outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on MTEB benchmark and instruction-following tasks, and exhibits emergent test-time scaling where generating more tokens improves embedding quality.

Conclusion: Generative iterative refinement establishes a new paradigm for representation learning that better captures semantic nuances compared to encoder-only methods.

Abstract: Existing large language model (LLM)-based embeddings typically adopt an
encoder-only paradigm, treating LLMs as static feature extractors and
overlooking their core generative strengths. We introduce GIRCSE (Generative
Iterative Refinement for Contrastive Sentence Embeddings), a novel framework
that leverages autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic
representations. By producing sequences of soft tokens optimized under
contrastive objective, GIRCSE captures latent concepts and implicit semantics
that encoder-only methods often miss. To guide this process, we propose an
Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective that encourages each
refinement step to yield better representations. Extensive experiments show
that GIRCSE outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on the MTEB
benchmark and instruction-following tasks. Moreover, GIRCSE exhibits an
emergent test-time scaling property: generating more tokens at inference
steadily improves embedding quality. Our results establish generative iterative
refinement as a new paradigm for representation learning.

Abstract: Grounded theory offers deep insights from qualitative data, but its reliance
on expert-intensive manual coding presents a major scalability bottleneck.
Current computational tools stop short of true automation, keeping researchers
firmly in the loop. We introduce LOGOS, a novel, end-to-end framework that
fully automates the grounded theory workflow, transforming raw text into a

clustering, graph reasoning, and a novel iterative refinement process to build
highly reusable codebooks. To ensure fair comparison, we also introduce a
principled 5-dimensional metric and a train-test split protocol for
standardized, unbiased evaluation. Across five diverse corpora, LOGOS
consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves a remarkable $88.2\%$
alignment with an expert-developed schema on a complex dataset. LOGOS

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes vulnerabilities in Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) to jailbreak attacks, identifies key issues like greedy remasking bias and Denoising-path Dependence, and proposes DiffuGuard - a training-free defense framework that reduces attack success rates from 47.9% to 14.7% while maintaining model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of dLLMs introduces new vulnerabilities distinct from Autoregressive LLMs due to their iterative and parallel generation mechanisms, requiring specialized security analysis and defense strategies.

Method: The study analyzes dLLM vulnerabilities across intra-step and inter-step dynamics, identifies greedy remasking bias and Denoising-path Dependence, and proposes DiffuGuard with two components: Stochastic Annealing Remasking to mitigate selection bias, and Block-level Audit and Repair for autonomous risk detection and correction.

Result: Experimental results show DiffuGuard reduces Attack Success Rate against six diverse jailbreak methods from 47.9% to 14.7% across four dLLMs while preserving model utility and efficiency.

Conclusion: Current decoding strategies constitute significant vulnerabilities in dLLMs, but these models possess substantial intrinsic safety potential that can be unlocked through frameworks like DiffuGuard, which effectively addresses vulnerabilities without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) introduces
unprecedented vulnerabilities that are fundamentally distinct from
Autoregressive LLMs, stemming from their iterative and parallel generation
mechanisms. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of dLLM
vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks across two distinct dimensions: intra-step
and inter-step dynamics. Experimental results reveal a harmful bias inherent in
the standard greedy remasking strategy and identify a critical phenomenon we
term Denoising-path Dependence, where the safety of early-stage tokens
decisively influences the final output. These findings also indicate that while
current decoding strategies constitute a significant vulnerability, dLLMs
possess a substantial intrinsic safety potential. To unlock this potential, we
propose DiffuGuard, a training-free defense framework that addresses
vulnerabilities through a dual-stage approach: Stochastic Annealing Remasking
dynamically introduces controlled randomness to mitigate greedy selection bias,
while Block-level Audit and Repair exploits internal model representations for
autonomous risk detection and guided correction. Comprehensive experiments on
four dLLMs demonstrate DiffuGuard's exceptional effectiveness, reducing Attack
Success Rate against six diverse jailbreak methods from 47.9% to 14.7% while
preserving model utility and efficiency. Our code is available at:

*Junying Wang,Zicheng Zhang,Ye Shen,Yalun Wu,Yingji Liang,Yijin Guo,Farong Wen,Wenzhe Li,Xuezhi Zhao,Qi Jia,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for transforming Text-Only QA Pairs (TQAs) into high-quality Multi-Modal QA Pairs (MMQAs) with automatic evaluation and iterative refinement using an agentic system called Q-Mirror.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of high-quality multi-modal benchmarks for scientific reasoning is costly and unscalable, creating a bottleneck for advancing large models.

Method: Developed a TQA-to-MMQA framework with quality rubric, constructed benchmarks for evaluation, and created Q-Mirror agentic system that integrates MMQA generation and evaluation in a closed loop for iterative refinement.

Result: State-of-the-art models can generate MMQAs but with substantial gaps, while top-tier understanding models align well with human judgment in quality assessment. Q-Mirror improved average scores from 78.90 to 85.22 and pass rates from 72% to 95%.

Conclusion: The Q-Mirror agent provides a practical path to large-scale scientific benchmarks by automating the transformation of text-only QA pairs into high-quality multi-modal QA pairs through iterative refinement.

Abstract: High-quality, multi-modal benchmarks are crucial for advancing scientific
reasoning in large models yet their manual creation is costly and unscalable.
To address this bottleneck, we explore the potential for transforming Text-Only
QA Pairs (TQAs) into high-quality Multi-Modal QA Pairs (MMQAs), which include
three parts: 1) Task Definition \& Evaluation Rubric: We develop a TQA-to-MMQA
framework and establish a comprehensive, multi-dimensional MMQA quality rubric
that provides principles for the transformation. 2) Benchmark Construction:
Then we construct two extensive benchmarks to rigorously evaluate
state-of-the-art generation \& understanding models on the distinct tasks of
MMQA generation \& MMQA quality evaluation. 3) Preliminary Solution: We develop
an agentic system (Q-Mirror), which operationalizes our framework by
integrating MMQA generation and evaluation into a closed loop for iterative
refinement. Our experiments show that while state-of-the-art models can
generate MMQAs, their outputs still leave substantial gaps, underscoring the
need for reliable evaluation. We further demonstrate that top-tier
understanding models align closely with human judgment in MMQA quality
assessment. Leveraging both insights, the Q-Mirror agent raises average scores
from 78.90 to 85.22 and pass rates from 72\% to 95\%, offering a practical path
to large-scale scientific benchmarks.

### [485] [Dual Mechanisms of Value Expression: Intrinsic vs. Prompted Values in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24319)
*Jongwook Han,Jongwon Lim,Injin Kong,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs express values through intrinsic (learned) and prompted (explicit) mechanisms that share some components but also have unique elements, leading to different steerability and response diversity characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether intrinsic and prompted value expressions in LLMs overlap substantially or rely on different mechanisms, given their importance in value alignment and persona steering applications.

Method: Used two mechanistic approaches: (1) value vectors extracted from residual stream, and (2) value neurons from MLP layers that contribute to value expressions.

Result: Intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common components crucial for value expression but also have unique elements. This leads to different steerability (prompted > intrinsic) and response diversity (intrinsic > prompted).

Conclusion: The mechanisms for intrinsic and prompted value expression are partially overlapping but distinct, with intrinsic mechanisms promoting lexical diversity and prompted mechanisms strengthening instruction following, even affecting distant tasks like jailbreaking.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can express different values in two distinct
ways: (1) intrinsic expression, reflecting the model's inherent values learned
during training, and (2) prompted expression, elicited by explicit prompts.
Given their widespread use in value alignment and persona steering, it is
paramount to clearly understand their underlying mechanisms, particularly
whether they mostly overlap (as one might expect) or rely on substantially
different mechanisms, but this remains largely understudied. We analyze this at
the mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, feature
directions representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream,
and (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value expressions. We
demonstrate that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common
components that are crucial for inducing value expression, but also possess
unique elements that manifest in different ways. As a result, these mechanisms
lead to different degrees of value steerability (prompted > intrinsic) and
response diversity (intrinsic > prompted). In particular, components unique to
the intrinsic mechanism seem to promote lexical diversity in responses, whereas
those specific to the prompted mechanism primarily strengthen instruction
following, taking effect even in distant tasks like jailbreaking.

TL;DR: This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of LLMs and MLLMs for multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning, covering architectures, datasets, benchmarks, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks a systematic review despite notable progress in LLMs and MLLMs for emotion recognition and reasoning, particularly in AI for Science applications.

Method: Conducts a comprehensive survey and analysis of existing LLM and MLLM approaches for emotion recognition and reasoning, including model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks.

Result: Provides an authoritative reference and practical insights for researchers, consolidating recent developments in this rapidly growing frontier.

Conclusion: This survey fills a critical gap in the literature and serves as the first comprehensive overview of MLLMs applied to multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning, with available resources on GitHub.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have driven major advances in
language understanding, marking a significant step toward artificial general
intelligence (AGI). With increasing demands for higher-level semantics and
cross-modal fusion, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged,
integrating diverse information sources (e.g., text, vision, and audio) to
enhance modeling and reasoning in complex scenarios. In AI for Science,
multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning has become a rapidly growing
frontier. While LLMs and MLLMs have achieved notable progress in this area, the
field still lacks a systematic review that consolidates recent developments. To
address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLMs and MLLMs
for emotion recognition and reasoning, covering model architectures, datasets,
and performance benchmarks. We further highlight key challenges and outline
future research directions, aiming to offer researchers both an authoritative
reference and practical insights for advancing this domain. To the best of our
knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to comprehensively survey the
intersection of MLLMs with multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning. The

*Sungkyun Kim,Jaemin Kim,Dogyung Yoon,Jiho Shin,Junyeol Lee,Jiwon Seo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speculative Verification (SV) enhances speculative decoding by dynamically predicting speculation accuracy and adapting verification length to maximize throughput, achieving up to 2x speedup over standard speculative decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of speculative decoding where low speculation accuracy leads to overhead from rejected tokens, particularly problematic at large batch sizes.

Method: Introduce a companion model to estimate alignment between draft and target model distributions, dynamically adjusting verification length to reduce wasted computation on rejected tokens.

Result: SV consistently outperforms both standard speculative decoding and target model decoding across all experiments, with up to 2x speedup over SD and average 1.4x speedup in large-batch settings (batch sizes 32-80).

Conclusion: SV demonstrates robustness, scalability, and practical utility for efficient LLM inference without requiring modifications to draft or target models, and is compatible with existing SD variants.

Abstract: LLMs have low GPU efficiency and high latency due to autoregressive decoding.
Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this using a small draft model to
speculatively generate multiple tokens, which are then verified in parallel by
a target model. However, when speculation accuracy is low, the overhead from
rejected tokens can offset the benefits, limiting SD's effectiveness,
especially at large batch sizes. To address this, we propose Speculative
Verification (SV), an efficient augmentation to SD that dynamically predicts
speculation accuracy and adapts the verification length to maximize throughput.
SV introduces a companion model - a small auxiliary model similar in size to
the draft model - to estimate the alignment between draft and target model
distributions. By maximizing the information gain from quantifying this
alignment, SV refines verification decisions, reducing wasted computation on
rejected tokens and improving decoding efficiency. Moreover, SV requires no
modifications to the draft or target models and is compatible with existing SD
variants. We extensively evaluated SV on publicly available LLMs across three
NLP tasks using nine combinations of draft, companion, and target models,
including 13B-72B target models and three types of variations: base (no
finetuning), instruction-tuned, and task fine-tuned. Across all experiments and
batch sizes (4-80), SV consistently outperforms both SD and standard decoding
with the target model. It improves SD performance by up to 2$\times$, with an
average speedup of 1.4 $\times$ in large-batch settings (batch sizes 32-80).
These results demonstrate SV's robustness, scalability, and practical utility
for efficient LLM inference.

*Mengyu Bu,Shaolei Zhang,Zhongjun He,Hua Wu,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AlignX is a two-stage framework that enhances multilingual LLM performance through representation alignment and instruction fine-tuning, improving cross-lingual capabilities for non-dominant languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual LLMs have performance gaps for non-dominant languages, with existing fine-tuning approaches leading to imprecise alignment and suboptimal knowledge transfer.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) multilingual representation alignment through semantic alignment and language feature integration, (2) multilingual instruction fine-tuning to stimulate capabilities.

Result: Experimental results show enhanced multilingual general and cross-lingual generation capabilities, with multilingual representations becoming closer and cross-lingual alignment improving.

Conclusion: AlignX effectively bridges multilingual performance gaps by improving representation alignment and cross-lingual capabilities in pre-trained LLMs.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) possess impressive multilingual
understanding and generation capabilities. However, their performance and
cross-lingual alignment often lag for non-dominant languages. A common solution
is to fine-tune LLMs on large-scale and more balanced multilingual corpus, but
such approaches often lead to imprecise alignment and suboptimal knowledge
transfer, struggling with limited improvements across languages. In this paper,
we propose AlignX to bridge the multilingual performance gap, which is a
two-stage representation-level framework for enhancing multilingual performance
of pre-trained LLMs. In the first stage, we align multilingual representations
with multilingual semantic alignment and language feature integration. In the
second stage, we stimulate the multilingual capability of LLMs via multilingual
instruction fine-tuning. Experimental results on several pre-trained LLMs
demonstrate that our approach enhances LLMs' multilingual general and
cross-lingual generation capability. Further analysis indicates that AlignX
brings the multilingual representations closer and improves the cross-lingual
alignment.

### [489] [Beyond Repetition: Text Simplification and Curriculum Learning for Data-Constrained Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24356)
*Matthew Theodore Roque,Dan John Velasco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies curriculum learning in pretraining for data-constrained settings, examining text-complexity ordering and data augmentation via simplification. It finds that adding simplified data improves performance over repeated exposure, with optimal ordering strategies varying by model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most language model pretraining research focuses on large datasets, leaving optimization strategies for data-constrained settings underexplored, particularly regarding training data order and inclusion of alternative text versions.

Method: Built on parallel corpora with human-written paragraphs aligned with LLM-simplified variants. Tested four data schedules: repeated exposure, low-to-high complexity, high-to-low complexity, and interleaved ordering. Analyzed representation quality through fine-tuning efficiency and zero-shot performance on multiple tasks.

Result: Adding simplified data improves fine-tuning and zero-shot performance over repeated-exposure baseline. Smaller models benefit from low-to-high complexity ordering, while larger models perform better with interleaved ordering.

Conclusion: Curriculum learning strategies in pretraining, particularly text-complexity ordering and data augmentation via simplification, can significantly improve model performance in data-constrained settings, with optimal approaches depending on model size.

Abstract: Most studies on language model pretraining focus on large datasets, leaving
open questions about optimization in data-constrained settings. In such
settings, the effects of training data order and of including alternative
versions of the same text remain underexplored. We address this by studying
curriculum learning in pretraining, focusing on text-complexity ordering and
data augmentation via simplification. We ask: (1) Does simplifying texts
enhance representation quality more than reusing the original data? and (2)
Does ordering data by text complexity yield better representations? To answer,
we build on a pair of parallel corpora where human-written paragraphs are
aligned with LLM-simplified variants, and test four data schedules: repeated
exposure, low-to-high complexity, high-to-low, and interleaved. We analyze
models' representation quality from a sample efficiency perspective via
fine-tuning, as well as its zero-shot performance on linguistic knowledge,
entity tracking, world knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our findings show
that adding simplified data improves fine-tuning and zero-shot performance over
a repeated-exposure baseline: smaller models benefit from low-to-high
complexity, while larger models perform better with interleaved ordering.

### [490] [Reinforcement Mid-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24375)
*Yijun Tian,Shaoyu Chen,Zhichao Xu,Yawei Wang,Jinhe Bi,Peng Han,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes reinforcement mid-training (RMT) as an intermediate stage between pre-training and post-training for LLMs, addressing inefficiency, token entropy imbalance, and underutilization through dynamic token budgeting, curriculum sampling, and dual training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM development lacks an intermediate stage between pre-training and post-training that could provide significant performance gains. The paper identifies three key challenges: inefficient training from excessive reasoning, imbalanced token entropy distribution, and underutilization of token information.

Method: RMT framework with three components: (1) dynamic token budget mechanism to constrain unnecessary reasoning steps, (2) curriculum-based adaptive sampling for progressive learning from easy to hard tokens, (3) dual training strategy combining RL with next-token prediction to target key tokens and fully utilize token information.

Result: Achieves up to +64.91% performance improvement with only 21% of reasoning length in language modeling. Checkpoints from reinforcement mid-training also improve subsequent post-training by up to +18.76% in mathematical domain.

Conclusion: Reinforcement mid-training is a valuable intermediate stage that significantly enhances LLM performance and efficiency, with the proposed RMT framework effectively addressing key training challenges through innovative mechanisms.

Abstract: The development of state-of-the-art large language models is commonly
understood as a two-stage process involving pre-training and post-training. We
point out the need for an additional intermediate stage called reinforcement
mid-training with potential for strong performance gains. In this paper, we
formally define the problem and identify three key challenges: (1) inefficient
training due to excessive reasoning steps, (2) disregard of the imbalanced
token entropy distribution, and (3) underutilization of token information. To
address these challenges, we propose RMT, a framework for efficient, adaptive,
and unified reinforcement mid-training with various innovative components. In
particular, we first introduce a dynamic token budget mechanism that constrains
unnecessary reasoning steps and mitigates model overthinking. Next, we design a
curriculum-based adaptive sampling method that fosters a progressive learning
trajectory from easy to hard tokens. Finally, we present a dual training
strategy that combines reinforcement learning with next-token prediction,
ensuring targeted learning on key tokens and full exploitation of all token
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of RMT over
state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to +64.91% performance improvement with
only 21% of the reasoning length in language modeling. We also show that
checkpoints obtained after reinforcement mid-training can benefit the
subsequent post-training, yielding up to +18.76% improvement in the
mathematical domain.

TL;DR: HarmMetric Eval is a benchmark for evaluating harmfulness metrics and judges in LLM jailbreak scenarios, revealing that traditional metrics like METEOR and ROUGE-1 outperform LLM-based judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of jailbreak attacks on LLMs has led to diverse evaluation metrics, but the absence of a systematic benchmark undermines the credibility of reported jailbreak effectiveness and risks.

Method: Developed HarmMetric Eval benchmark with a high-quality dataset of harmful prompts paired with diverse model responses, and a flexible scoring mechanism compatible with various metrics and judges.

Result: Extensive experiments showed that conventional metrics METEOR and ROUGE-1 outperform LLM-based judges in evaluating harmfulness of model responses, challenging prevailing beliefs about LLMs' superiority.

Conclusion: HarmMetric Eval provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating harmfulness metrics, revealing unexpected superiority of traditional metrics over LLM-based judges in jailbreak evaluation.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe deployment, yet jailbreak attacks can subvert this alignment to
elicit harmful outputs from LLMs. In recent years, a proliferation of jailbreak
attacks has emerged, accompanied by diverse metrics and judges to assess the
harmfulness of the LLM outputs. However, the absence of a systematic benchmark
to assess the quality and effectiveness of these metrics and judges undermines
the credibility of the reported jailbreak effectiveness and other risks. To
address this gap, we introduce HarmMetric Eval, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to support both overall and fine-grained evaluation of harmfulness
metrics and judges. Our benchmark includes a high-quality dataset of
representative harmful prompts paired with diverse harmful and non-harmful
model responses, alongside a flexible scoring mechanism compatible with various
metrics and judges. With HarmMetric Eval, our extensive experiments uncover a
surprising result: two conventional metrics--METEOR and ROUGE-1--outperform
LLM-based judges in evaluating the harmfulness of model responses, challenging
prevailing beliefs about LLMs' superiority in this domain. Our dataset is
publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/qusgo/HarmMetric_Eval,

MoE's strengths under efficient inference with few active parameters, and opens
ample room for further exploration of diffusion language models. LLaDA-MoE

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most Text-to-SQL benchmarks are English-only, limiting progress in multilingual database access. There's a need for benchmarks that test linguistic and dialectal variability across languages.

Method: Extends Spider 2.0 to 8 languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese) while preserving structural difficulty. Uses collaboration-driven language agents that iteratively refine queries.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs achieve only 4% execution accuracy on intrinsic reasoning vs 60% on MultiSpider 1.0. Collaboration-driven agents improve accuracy to 15%, still showing a substantial multilingual gap.

Conclusion: There's a significant multilingual performance gap in Text-to-SQL that requires methods robust across languages for real-world enterprise deployment. The benchmark motivates development of more language-agnostic approaches.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables natural access to databases, yet most benchmarks are
English-only, limiting multilingual progress. We introduce MultiSpider 2.0,
extending Spider 2.0 to eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish,
Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese). It preserves Spider 2.0's
structural difficulty while adding linguistic and dialectal variability,
demanding deeper reasoning for complex SQL. On this benchmark, state-of-the-art
LLMs (such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1) reach only 4\% execution accuracy when
relying on intrinsic reasoning, versus 60\% on MultiSpider 1.0. Therefore, we
provide a collaboration-driven language agents baseline that iteratively
refines queries, improving accuracy to 15\%. These results reveal a substantial
multilingual gap and motivate methods that are robust across languages and
ready for real-world enterprise deployment. Our benchmark is available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Cognition-Domain-Task (CDT) framework to comprehensively evaluate LLM capabilities across cognitive, domain, and task dimensions, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks that focus on isolated abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs often focus on isolated abilities and lack a holistic framework for comprehensive capability assessment, creating a gap in evaluation methods.

Method: Proposed the CDT framework that measures model capabilities across three dimensions (cognition, domain, task), incorporating Cattell-Horn-Carroll cognitive theory to refine capability categorization. Applied CDT for dataset capability evaluation and data selection.

Result: Capability metrics showed strong correlation with downstream performance. Data selection experiments achieved significant improvements with scores of 44.3 and 45.4, increasing by 1.6 and 2.2 points over baselines respectively.

Conclusion: The CDT framework is effective and practical for comprehensive LLM evaluation, supporting dataset analysis and construction while improving performance on both general and specific benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced
their capabilities, highlighting the need for comprehensive evaluation
frameworks that extend beyond task-specific benchmarks. However, existing
benchmarks often focus on isolated abilities, lacking a holistic framework for
assessing LLM capabilities. To address this gap, we propose the
Cognition-Domain-Task (CDT) framework, which comprehensively measures a model's
capabilities across three dimensions. We expand the scope of model capability
definitions at the cognitive level by incorporating the Cattell-Horn-Carroll
cognitive theory, refining the categorization of model capabilities. We apply
CDT in two directions: dataset capability evaluation and data selection.
Experiments show that our capability metrics correlate well with downstream
performance and can support effective dataset analysis and construction. The
experiments on data selection also show significant improvements in both
general and specific benchmarks, achieving scores of 44.3 and 45.4, with an
increase of 1.6 and 2.2 points over the baselines, respectively. These results
validate the effectiveness and practicality of CDT. Source code and models are

*Charlie Wyatt,Aditya Joshi,Flora Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey categorizes alternatives to Next Token Prediction (NTP) in LLMs into five families to address NTP's limitations like poor planning and error accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NTP drives LLM success but causes weaknesses in long-term planning, error accumulation, and computational inefficiency, prompting exploration of alternatives.

Method: The survey systematically categorizes NTP alternatives into five families: Multi-Token Prediction, Plan-then-Generate, Latent Reasoning, Continuous Generation Approaches, and Non-Transformer Architectures.

Result: A comprehensive taxonomy of emerging alternatives to NTP is presented, synthesizing insights across different approaches to address token-level generation limitations.

Conclusion: The survey provides a structured framework to guide research into transformative NLP models that overcome NTP's known limitations through alternative generation paradigms.

Abstract: The paradigm of Next Token Prediction (NTP) has driven the unprecedented
success of Large Language Models (LLMs), but is also the source of their most
persistent weaknesses such as poor long-term planning, error accumulation, and
computational inefficiency. Acknowledging the growing interest in exploring
alternatives to NTP, the survey describes the emerging ecosystem of
alternatives to NTP. We categorise these approaches into five main families:
(1) Multi-Token Prediction, which targets a block of future tokens instead of a
single one; (2) Plan-then-Generate, where a global, high-level plan is created
upfront to guide token-level decoding; (3) Latent Reasoning, which shifts the
autoregressive process itself into a continuous latent space; (4) Continuous
Generation Approaches, which replace sequential generation with iterative,
parallel refinement through diffusion, flow matching, or energy-based methods;
and (5) Non-Transformer Architectures, which sidestep NTP through their
inherent model structure. By synthesizing insights across these methods, this
survey offers a taxonomy to guide research into models that address the known
limitations of token-level generation to develop new transformative models for
natural language processing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current debiasing methods may degrade LLM capabilities, and previous evaluations focused on general language understanding rather than cultural commonsense, which is closely related to social biases.

Method: Proposed SOBACO benchmark for Japanese LLMs to evaluate social biases and cultural commonsense in unified format, then tested several LLMs with debiasing methods.

Result: Debiasing methods significantly degraded cultural commonsense performance (up to 75% accuracy deterioration) while reducing social biases.

Conclusion: There's a trade-off between bias mitigation and cultural commonsense preservation, highlighting the need for debiasing methods that consider both fairness and utility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases, prompting the development
of various debiasing methods. However, debiasing methods may degrade the
capabilities of LLMs. Previous research has evaluated the impact of bias
mitigation primarily through tasks measuring general language understanding,
which are often unrelated to social biases. In contrast, cultural commonsense
is closely related to social biases, as both are rooted in social norms and
values. The impact of bias mitigation on cultural commonsense in LLMs has not
been well investigated. Considering this gap, we propose SOBACO (SOcial BiAs
and Cultural cOmmonsense benchmark), a Japanese benchmark designed to evaluate
social biases and cultural commonsense in LLMs in a unified format. We evaluate
several LLMs on SOBACO to examine how debiasing methods affect cultural
commonsense in LLMs. Our results reveal that the debiasing methods degrade the
performance of the LLMs on the cultural commonsense task (up to 75% accuracy
deterioration). These results highlight the importance of developing debiasing
methods that consider the trade-off with cultural commonsense to improve
fairness and utility of LLMs.

*Lasse Borgholt,Jakob Havtorn,Christian Igel,Lars Maaløe,Zheng-Hua Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a novel alignment algorithm combining dynamic programming with beam search scoring to enable finer-grained error analysis in speech recognition by accurately aligning reference and model transcripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech recognition evaluation metrics like word error rate are dominated by frequent words, hiding important errors in rare terms, named entities, and domain-specific vocabulary that need finer-grained analysis.

Method: Developed a novel alignment algorithm that couples dynamic programming with beam search scoring to provide more accurate alignment between reference and model transcripts than traditional text alignment methods.

Result: The approach provides more accurate alignment of individual errors compared to traditional text alignment methods, enabling reliable error analysis for speech recognition systems.

Conclusion: The proposed alignment algorithm enables finer-grained error analysis in speech recognition by providing accurate alignment, and the tool is made available via PyPI for broader use.

Abstract: Modern neural networks have greatly improved performance across speech
recognition benchmarks. However, gains are often driven by frequent words with
limited semantic weight, which can obscure meaningful differences in word error
rate, the primary evaluation metric. Errors in rare terms, named entities, and
domain-specific vocabulary are more consequential, but remain hidden by
aggregate metrics. This highlights the need for finer-grained error analysis,
which depends on accurate alignment between reference and model transcripts.
However, conventional alignment methods are not designed for such precision. We
propose a novel alignment algorithm that couples dynamic programming with beam
search scoring. Compared to traditional text alignment methods, our approach
provides more accurate alignment of individual errors, enabling reliable error
analysis. The algorithm is made available via PyPI.

### [499] [Sanitize Your Responses: Mitigating Privacy Leakage in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24488)
*Wenjie Fu,Huandong Wang,Junyao Gao,Guoan Wan,Tao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-Sanitize is a novel LLM-driven framework that provides real-time mitigation of harmful content generation through self-monitoring and self-repair mechanisms, achieving superior performance with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mitigation strategies for harmful content in LLMs rely on post-hoc filtering, which introduces latency and computational overhead, and is incompatible with token-level streaming generation. There's a need for real-time solutions that can handle privacy-invasive content more effectively.

Method: Self-Sanitize comprises a lightweight Self-Monitor module that continuously inspects high-level intentions at token level via representation engineering, and a Self-Repair module that performs in-place correction of harmful content without separate review dialogues.

Result: Extensive experiments on four LLMs across three privacy leakage scenarios demonstrate that Self-Sanitize achieves superior mitigation performance with minimal overhead and without degrading LLM utility.

Conclusion: Self-Sanitize offers a practical and robust solution for safer LLM deployments by enabling real-time streaming monitoring and seamless repair of harmful content with negligible impact on latency and resource utilization.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a wide
range of applications, such as chatbots and code copilots, concerns surrounding
the generation of harmful content have come increasingly into focus. Despite
significant advances in aligning LLMs with safety and ethical standards,
adversarial prompts can still be crafted to elicit undesirable responses.
Existing mitigation strategies are predominantly based on post-hoc filtering,
which introduces substantial latency or computational overhead, and is
incompatible with token-level streaming generation. In this work, we introduce
Self-Sanitize, a novel LLM-driven mitigation framework inspired by cognitive
psychology, which emulates human self-monitor and self-repair behaviors during
conversations. Self-Sanitize comprises a lightweight Self-Monitor module that
continuously inspects high-level intentions within the LLM at the token level
via representation engineering, and a Self-Repair module that performs in-place
correction of harmful content without initiating separate review dialogues.
This design allows for real-time streaming monitoring and seamless repair, with
negligible impact on latency and resource utilization. Given that
privacy-invasive content has often been insufficiently focused in previous
studies, we perform extensive experiments on four LLMs across three privacy
leakage scenarios. The results demonstrate that Self-Sanitize achieves superior
mitigation performance with minimal overhead and without degrading the utility
of LLMs, offering a practical and robust solution for safer LLM deployments.

*Hongcheng Wang,Yinuo Huang,Sukai Wang,Guanghui Ren,Hao Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRPO-MA improves upon GRPO by using multi-answer generation per thought to address gradient coupling, sparse rewards, and unstable advantage estimation in training reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address three key challenges in GRPO algorithm: gradient coupling between thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals from limited parallel sampling, and unstable advantage estimation.

Method: Propose GRPO-MA which leverages multi-answer generation from each thought process, theoretically reducing variance of thought advantage as number of answers per thought increases.

Result: Empirical gradient analysis shows GRPO-MA reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and multimodal tasks demonstrate substantial performance and training efficiency improvements.

Conclusion: Increasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model performance, making GRPO-MA a more robust and efficient optimization method for training reasoning in LLMs and VLMs.

Abstract: Recent progress, such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that the GRPO algorithm, a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, can effectively train Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). In this paper, we analyze three challenges of GRPO: gradient coupling
between thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals caused by limited parallel
sampling, and unstable advantage estimation. To mitigate these challenges, we
propose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages
multi-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and
efficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought
advantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases.
Empirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA
reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and
diverse multimodal tasks demonstrate that GRPO-MA substantially improves
performance and training efficiency. Our ablation studies further reveal that
increasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model
performance.

*Haewon Park,Sangwoo Kim,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SUIT is a knowledge editing method that modifies only the critical feature subspace in MLP layers to correct factual errors in language models, achieving better knowledge preservation than existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing locate-then-edit methods for knowledge editing cause significant perturbations to language models because they modify MLP layers without constraints on key and value vectors, leading to unwanted side effects.

Method: SUIT identifies and modifies only the subspace of critical features relevant to the edit in MLP layers, rather than making unconstrained modifications to key and value vectors.

Result: Empirical results on LLaMA-3-8B, GPT-J-6B, and Qwen2.5-7B show SUIT dramatically improves knowledge preservation while maintaining high edit efficacy compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: SUIT successfully identifies the critical subspace for edits, providing an effective knowledge editing approach with minimal model perturbation, as validated through additional analyses.

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently correct factual errors in Language
Models (LMs). The popular locate-then-edit approach modifies an MLP layer by
finding an optimal mapping between its input vector (key) and output vector
(value) that leads to the expression of the edited knowledge. However, existing
methods without any constraints on the key and value vectors cause significant
perturbations to the edited model. To address this, we propose Subspace
Knowledge Edit (SUIT), a method that identifies and modifies only the subspace
of critical features relevant to the edit. Our empirical results on LLaMA-3-8B,
GPT-J-6B, and Qwen2.5-7B models show that SUIT dramatically improves knowledge
preservation over strong baselines while maintaining high edit efficacy. This
effectiveness confirms that SUIT successfully identifies the critical subspace
for the edit. Further analyses provide additional validation for our approach.
The source code and data will be released to the public upon publication of the
paper.

TL;DR: Samiksha is a community-driven evaluation pipeline for LLMs, co-created with civil-society organizations and community members, focusing on culturally aware and contextually grounded assessments in domains like healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations lack grounding in the lived realities of end users, especially in critical domains like healthcare where cultural practices and community needs are essential.

Method: Co-creation with civil-society organizations and community members to develop a scalable, automated benchmarking pipeline that incorporates community feedback on what to evaluate, how to build benchmarks, and how to score outputs.

Result: Demonstrated the approach in the health domain in India, analyzing how current multilingual LLMs handle nuanced community health queries.

Conclusion: Samiksha offers a scalable pathway for contextually grounded and inclusive LLM evaluation, addressing the gap between artificial benchmarks and real community needs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated through general or
domain-specific benchmarks testing capabilities that often lack grounding in
the lived realities of end users. Critical domains such as healthcare require
evaluations that extend beyond artificial or simulated tasks to reflect the
everyday needs, cultural practices, and nuanced contexts of communities. We
propose Samiksha, a community-driven evaluation pipeline co-created with
civil-society organizations (CSOs) and community members. Our approach enables
scalable, automated benchmarking through a culturally aware, community-driven
pipeline in which community feedback informs what to evaluate, how the
benchmark is built, and how outputs are scored. We demonstrate this approach in
the health domain in India. Our analysis highlights how current multilingual
LLMs address nuanced community health queries, while also offering a scalable
pathway for contextually grounded and inclusive LLM evaluation.

### [503] [AdaThink-Med: Medical Adaptive Thinking with Uncertainty-Guided Length Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24560)
*Shaohao Rui,Kaitao Chen,Weijie Ma,Xiaosong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaThink-Med is an end-to-end framework that enhances adaptive thinking in medical LLMs by using uncertainty-guided length calibration to reduce reasoning length for simple questions while maintaining performance on complex ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical LLMs use lengthy reasoning processes regardless of question difficulty, leading to high inference costs. Adaptive thinking is needed where models think less for simple questions and more for complex ones.

Method: Generates multiple candidate outputs, evaluates correctness and uncertainty, estimates problem difficulty via uncertainty-guided length calibration, penalizes long reasoning for easy questions, and extends chain of thought for difficult ones.

Result: Achieves up to 6.4x length reduction on average while retaining performance with minimal degradation across six medical QA benchmarks. Spontaneously develops 'non-thinking' and 'thinking' reasoning modes.

Conclusion: AdaThink-Med successfully enables adaptive thinking in medical LLMs, dynamically suppressing redundant reasoning while maintaining performance, demonstrating practical efficiency for real-world medical applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought
have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and
medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in
lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question,
leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore,
enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and
think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs
in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches
designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while
providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and
computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first
end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical
reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first
generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the
correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem
difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs
with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer
reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers,
it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions.
On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length
reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation.
Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct
reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking",
demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes
dynamically.

*Melika Honarmand,Ayati Sharma,Badr AlKhamissi,Johannes Mehrer,Martin Schrimpf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using vision-language models to simulate dyslexia by identifying and perturbing word-processing units, showing selective reading impairments while preserving general visual and language abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for studying dyslexia are limited in testing causal hypotheses about reading impairments. Vision-language models offer a way to simulate and investigate the underlying mechanisms.

Method: Identified visual-word-form-selective units in VLMs and performed targeted ablation of these units, comparing with random unit ablation. Used stimuli from cognitive neuroscience.

Result: Targeted ablation of word-form-selective units caused selective reading impairments while general visual and language comprehension remained intact. The model replicated dyslexic humans' phonological deficits without significant orthographic processing changes.

Conclusion: The study establishes a computational framework for investigating reading disorders and successfully replicates key characteristics of dyslexia using vision-language models.

Abstract: Dyslexia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent reading
difficulties, is often linked to reduced activity of the visual word form area
in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Traditional approaches to studying
dyslexia, such as behavioral and neuroimaging methods, have provided valuable
insights but remain limited in their ability to test causal hypotheses about
the underlying mechanisms of reading impairments. In this study, we use
large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by functionally
identifying and perturbing artificial analogues of word processing. Using
stimuli from cognitive neuroscience, we identify visual-word-form-selective
units within VLMs and demonstrate that targeted ablation of these units, unlike
ablation of random units, leads to selective impairments in reading tasks while
general visual and language comprehension abilities remain intact. In
particular, the resulting model matches dyslexic humans' phonological deficits
without a significant change in orthographic processing. Taken together, our
modeling results replicate key characteristics of dyslexia and establish a
computational framework for investigating reading disorders.

TL;DR: HiKE is the first Korean-English code-switching benchmark that provides natural CS data with hierarchical labels to systematically evaluate multilingual ASR models' ability to handle different levels of code-switching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code-switching remains an underexplored challenge in multilingual ASR despite advances in the field, with Korean-English CS being particularly understudied.

Method: Created HiKE benchmark with high-quality natural CS data across various topics, including meticulous loanword labels and hierarchical CS-level labeling (word, phrase, sentence) for systematic evaluation.

Result: Most multilingual ASR models initially struggle with CS-ASR, but this capability can be enabled through fine-tuning with CS data.

Conclusion: HiKE provides an accessible evaluation framework that enables systematic assessment of CS-ASR capabilities and demonstrates that fine-tuning with CS data can overcome initial performance limitations.

Abstract: Despite advances in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR),
code-switching (CS), the mixing of languages within an utterance common in
daily speech, remains a severely underexplored challenge. In this paper, we
introduce HiKE: the Hierarchical Korean-English code-switching benchmark, the
first globally accessible evaluation framework for Korean-English CS, aiming to
provide a means for the precise evaluation of multilingual ASR models and to
foster research in the field. The proposed framework not only consists of
high-quality, natural CS data across various topics, but also provides
meticulous loanword labels and a hierarchical CS-level labeling scheme (word,
phrase, and sentence) that together enable a systematic evaluation of a model's
ability to handle each distinct level of code-switching. Through evaluations of
diverse multilingual ASR models and fine-tuning experiments, this paper
demonstrates that while most multilingual ASR models initially struggle with
CS-ASR, this capability can be enabled through fine-tuning with CS data. HiKE

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces automatic hype detection in scientific writing, defines hype as hyperbolic/subjective language used to glamorize research, creates annotation guidelines, builds a dataset from NIH grant applications, and evaluates ML models for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hype in scientific writing is increasing and can undermine objective evidence evaluation, impede research development, and erode trust in science.

Method: Proposed formalized annotation guidelines for identifying hype language, annotated NIH grant application corpus, evaluated traditional text classifiers and language models, compared with human baseline.

Result: Formalizing annotation guidelines helps humans reliably annotate hype adjectives, training ML models on the annotated dataset yields promising results, but task shows linguistic complexity requiring domain knowledge and temporal awareness.

Conclusion: This is the first work to approach hype detection as an NLP task, highlighting both the potential of automated detection and the challenges posed by linguistic complexity and contextual understanding.

Abstract: In science, promotional language ('hype') is increasing and can undermine
objective evaluation of evidence, impede research development, and erode trust
in science. In this paper, we introduce the task of automatic detection of
hype, which we define as hyperbolic or subjective language that authors use to
glamorize, promote, embellish, or exaggerate aspects of their research. We
propose formalized guidelines for identifying hype language and apply them to
annotate a portion of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant application
corpus. We then evaluate traditional text classifiers and language models on
this task, comparing their performance with a human baseline. Our experiments
show that formalizing annotation guidelines can help humans reliably annotate
candidate hype adjectives and that using our annotated dataset to train machine
learning models yields promising results. Our findings highlight the linguistic
complexity of the task, and the potential need for domain knowledge and
temporal awareness of the facts. While some linguistic works address hype
detection, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to approach it as a
natural language processing task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention framework that enables efficient long-sequence processing by reusing dense attention parameters and smoothly transitioning between dense and sparse attention based on sequence length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention in Transformers faces computational bottlenecks with long sequences, and existing sparse attention methods introduce excessive parameters and disrupt the pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long workflow.

Method: InfLLM-V2 uses parameter-free architecture modification to reuse dense attention parameters, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence processing. It employs dense attention for short inputs and sparse attention for long sequences, with an efficient implementation to reduce computational overhead.

Result: InfLLM-V2 achieves 4x speedup over dense attention while retaining 98.1% performance on long-context understanding and 99.7% on chain-of-thought reasoning. The framework was used to train MiniCPM4.1, an open-source hybrid reasoning model.

Conclusion: InfLLM-V2 provides an efficient solution for long-sequence processing that maintains performance while significantly reducing computational costs, enabling practical acceleration for large language models.

Abstract: Long-sequence processing is a critical capability for modern large language
models. However, the self-attention mechanism in the standard Transformer
architecture faces severe computational and memory bottlenecks when processing
long sequences. While trainable sparse attention methods offer a promising
solution, existing approaches such as NSA introduce excessive extra parameters
and disrupt the conventional \textit{pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long}
workflow, resulting in slow convergence and difficulty in acceleration. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce dense-sparse switchable attention
framework, termed as InfLLM-V2. InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention that
seamlessly adapts models from short to long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM-V2
reuses dense attention parameters through parameter-free architecture
modification, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence
processing. Additionally, InfLLM-V2 ensures computational efficiency across all
sequence lengths, by using dense attention for short inputs and smoothly
transitioning to sparse attention for long sequences. To achieve practical
acceleration, we further introduce an efficient implementation of InfLLM-V2
that significantly reduces the computational overhead. Our experiments on
long-context understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning demonstrate that
InfLLM-V2 is 4$\times$ faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% and
99.7% of the performance, respectively. Based on the InfLLM-V2 framework, we
have trained and open-sourced MiniCPM4.1
(https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B), a hybrid reasoning model,
providing a reproducible implementation for the research community.

*Qingjie Zhang,Haoting Qian,Zhicong Huang,Cheng Hong,Minlie Huang,Ke Xu,Chao Zhang,Han Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Unlearning in LLMs appears effective by disrupting keyword focus, but knowledge remains recoverable through keyword emphasis, creating a dilemma between insufficient unlearning and catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of interpretability analyses of unlearning mechanisms in LLMs and understand why unlearning effectiveness remains contested.

Method: Proposed unPact framework that quantifies prompt token influence on outputs through prompt attribution and contribution tracking, enabling pre- and post-unlearning comparisons.

Result: Found that unlearning works by disrupting keyword focus, knowledge remains recoverable via keyword emphasis without weight modification, and catastrophic forgetting comes from indiscriminate token penalization.

Conclusion: Existing unlearning methods face a dilemma: either insufficient (knowledge recoverable) or overly destructive (catastrophic forgetting), leaving a gap to reliable unlearning.

Abstract: Unlearning seeks to remove specific knowledge from large language models
(LLMs), but its effectiveness remains contested. On one side, "forgotten"
knowledge can often be recovered through interventions such as light
fine-tuning; on the other side, unlearning may induce catastrophic forgetting
that degrades general capabilities. Despite active exploration of unlearning
methods, interpretability analyses of the mechanism are scarce due to the
difficulty of tracing knowledge in LLMs' complex architectures. We address this
gap by proposing unPact, an interpretable framework for unlearning via prompt
attribution and contribution tracking. Typically, it quantifies each prompt
token's influence on outputs, enabling pre- and post-unlearning comparisons to
reveal what changes. Across six mainstream unlearning methods, three LLMs, and
three benchmarks, we find that: (1) Unlearning appears to be effective by
disrupting focus on keywords in prompt; (2) Much of the knowledge is not truly
erased and can be recovered by simply emphasizing these keywords in prompts,
without modifying the model's weights; (3) Catastrophic forgetting arises from
indiscriminate penalization of all tokens. Taken together, our results suggest
an unlearning dilemma: existing methods tend either to be insufficient -
knowledge remains recoverable by keyword emphasis, or overly destructive -
general performance collapses due to catastrophic forgetting, still leaving a
gap to reliable unlearning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Latent Judges method uses internal model signals instead of Likert-scale ratings to provide more reliable and deterministic scores for LLM evaluation, addressing issues of instability and poor calibration in traditional prompting approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM-as-a-judge methods using Likert-scale ratings suffer from instability under sampling, poor calibration, score compression near the top of the scale, and frequent ties, making single-response evaluations unreliable.

Method: Proposed three latent methods: (1) probability-weighted scores over integer ratings, (2) verifier-style probabilities of "yes", and (3) linear probes trained on model activations at the rating position to derive scalar ratings from internal model signals.

Result: Across various benchmarks, latent methods match or surpass standard prompting, with consistent improvements in pairwise accuracy and listwise ranking. Probability-weighted scores achieve strongest single-rating correlations, while probes work well when output logits are miscalibrated.

Conclusion: Latent information provides deterministic and more discriminative signals for reference-free evaluation, improving selection and training approaches like Best-of-N, multi-teacher distillation, and routing.

Abstract: How reliable are single-response LLM-as-a-judge ratings without references,
and can we obtain fine-grained, deterministic scores in this setting? We study
the common practice of asking a judge model to assign Likert-scale scores to
free-text responses and show two systematic issues: scores are unstable under
sampling and poorly calibrated, leading to compression near the top of the
scale and frequent ties. We then propose and evaluate Latent Judges, which
derive scalar ratings from internal model signals: (i) probability-weighted
scores over integer ratings, (ii) verifier-style probabilities of "yes", and
(iii) linear probes trained on model activations at the rating position. Across
a broad suite of pairwise and single-rating benchmarks, latent methods match or
surpass standard prompting, with consistent gains on pairwise accuracy and
listwise ranking relevant to Best-of-N selection. Probability-weighted scores
achieve the strongest single-rating correlations, while probes recover useful
signals when output logits are miscalibrated. These results indicate that
latent information provides deterministic and more discriminative signals for
reference-free evaluation, and can improve selection and training approaches
like Best-of-$N$, multi-teacher distillation, and routing.

*Guibin Zhang,Muxin Fu,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemGen is a dynamic generative memory framework that enables LLM agents to develop human-like cognitive faculties through latent memory generation and integration during reasoning, achieving significant performance improvements over existing memory systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory paradigms for LLM agents are constrained - parametric memory forcibly adjusts model parameters, while retrieval-based memory externalizes experience into databases, neither capturing the fluid integration of reasoning and memory found in human cognition.

Method: MemGen consists of a memory trigger that monitors the agent's reasoning state to decide explicit memory invocation, and a memory weaver that takes the current state as stimulus to construct latent token sequences as machine-native memory to enrich reasoning.

Result: MemGen surpasses leading external memory systems (ExpeL, AWM) by up to 38.22%, exceeds GRPO by up to 13.44%, and exhibits strong cross-domain generalization. It spontaneously evolves distinct human-like memory faculties including planning, procedural, and working memory.

Conclusion: MemGen enables agents to recall and augment latent memory throughout reasoning, producing a tightly interwoven cycle of memory and cognition, suggesting an emergent trajectory toward more naturalistic forms of machine cognition.

Abstract: Agent memory shapes how Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents, akin to
the human brain, progressively refine themselves through environment
interactions. Existing paradigms remain constrained: parametric memory forcibly
adjusts model parameters, and retrieval-based memory externalizes experience
into structured databases, yet neither captures the fluid interweaving of
reasoning and memory that underlies human cognition. To address this gap, we
propose MemGen, a dynamic generative memory framework that equips agents with a
human-esque cognitive faculty. It consists of a \textit{memory trigger}, which
monitors the agent's reasoning state to decide explicit memory invocation, and
a \textit{memory weaver}, which takes the agent's current state as stimulus to
construct a latent token sequence as machine-native memory to enrich its
reasoning. In this way, MemGen enables agents to recall and augment latent
memory throughout reasoning, producing a tightly interwoven cycle of memory and
cognition. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks show that MemGen
surpasses leading external memory systems such as ExpeL and AWM by up to
$38.22\%$, exceeds GRPO by up to $13.44\%$, and exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization ability. More importantly, we find that without explicit
supervision, MemGen spontaneously evolves distinct human-like memory faculties,
including planning memory, procedural memory, and working memory, suggesting an
emergent trajectory toward more naturalistic forms of machine cognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for data synthesis struggle with inconsistent data quality and inability to dynamically adapt to evolving model capabilities, creating suboptimal training signals. There's a need for scalable, high-quality data generation without heavy human annotation.

Method: Uses three co-evolving agents: Solver (refines reasoning from preference feedback), Teacher (adaptively crafts challenging questions based on Solver's weaknesses), and Generator (distills Teacher's strategy for scalable curriculum generation). Forms a closed-loop system requiring only 100 seed questions.

Result: Socratic-Solver-8B achieves +20.2 percentage point average gain over prior methods across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Synthetic data from Socratic-Generator-32B enables student LLMs to outperform commercial SOTA models including Qwen3-235B-A22B, DeepSeek-V3.1-671B, GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Grok-4, and Claude-4.1-Opus.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that fully autonomous data generation through agent co-evolution can produce superior training curricula, enabling smaller models to outperform much larger commercial LLMs on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks rely
heavily on massive, high-quality datasets-typically human-annotated and thus
difficult to scale. While data synthesis or distillation offers a promising
alternative, existing methods struggle with inconsistent data quality and an
inability to dynamically adapt to the evolving capabilities of the model,
leading to suboptimal training signals. To address these limitations, we
introduce Socratic-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
high-quality training data from minimal seed examples through the co-evolution
of three agents: the Teacher, the Solver, and the Generator. The Solver
continuously refines its reasoning by learning from preference feedback on both
successful and failed trajectories; the Teacher adaptively crafts increasingly
challenging questions based on the Solver's weaknesses; and the Generator
distills the Teacher's question-design strategy to enable scalable,
high-fidelity curriculum generation. This closed-loop system produces a
self-improving curriculum-requiring no pre-existing tasks or labels.
Remarkably, starting from only 100 seed questions, our Socratic-Solver-8B
achieves an average gain of +20.2 percentage points over prior data synthesis
methods across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24-25,
Olympiad, MATH-500, Minerva, and GSM8K), with consistent gains on both Qwen3
and GLM4 series models. Even more surprisingly, synthetic data from
Socratic-Generator-32B enables student LLMs to achieve superior performance
compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) commercial LLMs on these benchmarks,
including Qwen3-235B-A22B, DeepSeek-V3.1-671B, GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Grok-4,
and Claude-4.1-Opus.

### [512] [ProxyAttn: Guided Sparse Attention via Representative Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24745)
*Yixuan Wang,Huang He,Siqi Bao,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProxyAttn is a training-free sparse attention algorithm that improves efficiency in LLMs by compressing attention head dimensions and using representative proxy heads to approximate all heads, achieving up to 10.3x attention acceleration without significant performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms limits LLM efficiency on long-text tasks. Existing methods that dynamically estimate block importance for sparse attention suffer from coarse-grained estimation that leads to performance degradation at high sparsity rates.

Method: ProxyAttn compresses attention head dimensions and uses scores from pooled representative heads to approximate all heads. It also includes a block-aware dynamic budget estimation method to account for varying sparsity among heads, enabling fine-grained block importance evaluation at low computational cost.

Result: Experiments show ProxyAttn achieves up to 10.3x attention acceleration and 2.4x prefilling acceleration without significant performance loss across various mainstream models and benchmarks, confirming the underlying similarity among attention heads.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves substantial gains in performance and efficiency compared to existing methods by leveraging fine-grained block importance estimation through representative proxy heads and dynamic budget allocation.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms limits the efficiency of
Large Language Models (LLMs) on long-text tasks. Recently, methods that
dynamically estimate block importance have enabled efficient block sparse
attention, leading to significant acceleration in long-text pre-filling of
LLMs. However, their coarse-grained estimation inevitably leads to performance
degradation at high sparsity rates. In this work, we propose ProxyAttn, a
training-free sparse attention algorithm that achieves more precise block
estimation by compressing the dimension of attention heads. Based on our
observation of the similarity among multiple attention heads, we use the scores
of pooled representative heads to approximate the scores for all heads. To
account for the varying sparsity among heads, we also propose a block-aware
dynamic budget estimation method. By combining the scores from representative
proxy heads with multi-head dynamic budgets, we achieve a more fine-grained
block importance evaluation at low computational cost. Experiments on a variety
of mainstream models and extensive benchmarks confirm the underlying similarity
among attention heads. Leveraging a fine-grained estimation, the proposed
method achieves substantial gains in performance and efficiency compared to
existing methods. More precisely, ProxyAttn can achieve up to 10.3x attention
acceleration and 2.4x prefilling acceleration without significant performance
loss. Our code is available at https://github.com/wyxstriker/ProxyAttn.

*Guibin Zhang,Fanci Meng,Guancheng Wan,Zherui Li,Kun Wang,Zhenfei Yin,Lei Bai,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LatentEvolve is a self-evolving test-time scaling framework that enables LLMs to progressively learn how to scale computation more effectively through alternating daytime and nighttime processes inspired by human cognitive systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling methods are independent and don't allow LLMs to progressively learn better scaling strategies. The goal is to evolve LLMs to learn "how to scale test-time computation" by mimicking human cognitive processes.

Method: LatentEvolve uses a dual evolutionary system: daytime scaling rapidly retrieves historical latent representations to guide current reasoning, while nighttime scaling integrates past latent optimizations similar to human memory consolidation during sleep. This alternation enables fast and slow evolution in an unsupervised manner.

Result: Extensive experiments across 8 benchmarks and 5 model backbones show LatentEvolve surpasses state-of-the-art TTS methods like LatentSeek and TTRL by up to 13.33%, with exceptional cross-domain and cross-backbone generalization.

Conclusion: LatentEvolve successfully enables LLMs to progressively learn better test-time scaling strategies through a biologically-inspired dual evolutionary framework, achieving superior performance and generalization compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Test-time Scaling (TTS) has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) during the inference
phase without altering model parameters. However, existing TTS methods are
largely independent, implying that LLMs have not yet evolved to progressively
learn how to scale more effectively. With the objective of evolving LLMs to
learn ``how to scale test-time computation,'' we propose LatentEvolve, a
self-evolving latent TTS framework inspired by the complementary learning
system (CLS) theory. Analogous to the human brain's dual system of a
fast-recall hippocampus and a slow-consolidating neocortex, LatentEvolve
comprises two evolutionary components: \textit{daytime scaling}, which rapidly
retrieves historical latent representations to better guide current LLM
reasoning; and \textit{nighttime scaling}, which integrates past latent
optimizations in a manner akin to the human brain's consolidation of
experiences during sleep. The alternation of daytime and nighttime processes
facilitates a fast and slow evolution of LLM TTS, mirroring human cognitive
dynamics in a fully unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks and five model backbones demonstrate that our LatentEvolve surpasses
state-of-the-art TTS methods such as LatentSeek and TTRL by up to $13.33\%$ and
exhibits exceptional cross-domain and cross-backbone generalization.

*Jun Rao,Yunjie Liao,Xuebo Liu,Zepeng Lin,Lian Lian,Dong Jin,Shengjun Cheng,Jun Yu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeaPO is a Strategic Error Amplification method that introduces specific error patterns into LLM preference optimization to ensure negative samples are more erroneous than positive samples, improving model performance particularly in truthfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment methods struggle when positive and negative samples become similar in quality during training, complicating preference learning optimization.

Method: Leverages three common LLM error types to introduce specific error patterns into preference optimization, ensuring negative samples are more erroneous than positive samples.

Result: Significant improvements in overall model performance across five capability dimensions, with 5-10 percentage point gains in truthfulness across model scales from 1.5B to 14B parameters.

Conclusion: Strategic error amplification effectively enhances model performance, with task-specific improvements depending on the error types introduced and mixed error types providing broader performance enhancement.

Abstract: Existing alignment methods for preference optimization of large language
models (LLMs) aim to enhance model performance by utilizing pairs of positive
and negative samples. However, due to the limited capacity of models in scoring
or generating responses, the quality of positive and negative samples may
become similar during training, which complicates optimization for preference
learning. To address this issue, we introduce SeaPO, a Strategic Error
Amplification method that leverages three error types commonly occurring in
LLMs to introduce specific error patterns into the model Preference
Optimization. This strategy ensures that negative samples are more erroneous
than positive samples and preference-based training is employed to mitigate the
occurrence of these errors, thereby enhancing model performance. Evaluations
across five capability dimensions and different model scales (1.5B to 14B)
demonstrate that the generated data significantly improved overall model
performance, particularly in terms of truthfulness, with improvements of 5-10
percentage points observed. Further analysis reveals that task performance
varies depending on the error types introduced. Injecting the most common error
types improves performance in related tasks, while a mix of error types leads
to a broader performance enhancement: most tasks show stable improvements,
while a few tasks exhibit significant gains.

*Luisa Geiger,Mareike Hartmann,Michael Sullivan,Alexander Koller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a novel tree-based evaluation metric for LLM-generated assembly instructions that better captures spatiotemporal aspects than traditional text similarity metrics like BLEU and BERT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like BLEU and BERT similarity scores fail to adequately reflect spatiotemporal aspects of construction in step-by-step assembly instructions, particularly for domains like sewing.

Method: Developed an automatic tree-based evaluation metric specifically designed for LLM-generated step-by-step assembly instructions, focusing on spatiotemporal soundness.

Result: The proposed metric shows better correlation with manually-annotated error counts and human quality ratings, and is more robust against artificially-constructed counterfactual examples designed to confound text-based similarity metrics.

Conclusion: The tree-based metric is superior to traditional approaches for evaluating the spatiotemporal soundness of sewing instructions and demonstrates greater robustness against adversarial examples.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel, automatic tree-based evaluation metric for
LLM-generated step-by-step assembly instructions, that more accurately reflects
spatiotemporal aspects of construction than traditional metrics such as BLEU
and BERT similarity scores. We apply our proposed metric to the domain of
sewing instructions, and show that our metric better correlates with
manually-annotated error counts as well as human quality ratings, demonstrating
our metric's superiority for evaluating the spatiotemporal soundness of sewing
instructions. Further experiments show that our metric is more robust than
traditional approaches against artificially-constructed counterfactual examples
that are specifically constructed to confound metrics that rely on textual
similarity.

*Xilin Dang,Kexin Chen,Xiaorui Su,Ayush Noori,Iñaki Arango,Lucas Vittor,Xinyi Long,Yuyang Du,Marinka Zitnik,Pheng Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KnowGuard introduces a novel investigate-before-abstain paradigm that uses systematic knowledge graph exploration to improve LLM abstention in clinical decision-making, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 3.93% in accuracy while reducing unnecessary interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with abstention in medical scenarios, providing overconfident responses despite incomplete information. This is problematic because abstention is a critical safety mechanism in clinical practice to prevent harmful misdiagnoses when patient information is insufficient.

Method: A two-stage approach: 1) Evidence discovery through systematic knowledge graph exploration using graph expansion and direct retrieval, and 2) Evidence evaluation that ranks evidence using multiple factors to adapt exploration based on patient context and conversation history. Both stages operate on a shared contextualized evidence pool.

Result: KnowGuard outperforms state-of-the-art abstention approaches, improving diagnostic accuracy by 3.93% while reducing unnecessary interaction by 7.27 turns on average. It enables systematic knowledge graph exploration, allowing models to trace structured reasoning paths and recognize insufficient medical evidence.

Conclusion: The investigate-before-abstain paradigm with systematic knowledge graph exploration effectively addresses LLMs' abstention limitations in clinical decision-making, providing a more reliable safety mechanism for medical applications.

Abstract: In clinical practice, physicians refrain from making decisions when patient
information is insufficient. This behavior, known as abstention, is a critical
safety mechanism preventing potentially harmful misdiagnoses. Recent
investigations have reported the application of large language models (LLMs) in
medical scenarios. However, existing LLMs struggle with the abstentions,
frequently providing overconfident responses despite incomplete information.
This limitation stems from conventional abstention methods relying solely on
model self-assessments, which lack systematic strategies to identify knowledge
boundaries with external medical evidences. To address this, we propose
\textbf{KnowGuard}, a novel \textit{investigate-before-abstain} paradigm that
integrates systematic knowledge graph exploration for clinical decision-making.
Our approach consists of two key stages operating on a shared contextualized
evidence pool: 1) an evidence discovery stage that systematically explores the
medical knowledge space through graph expansion and direct retrieval, and 2) an
evidence evaluation stage that ranks evidence using multiple factors to adapt
exploration based on patient context and conversation history. This two-stage
approach enables systematic knowledge graph exploration, allowing models to
trace structured reasoning paths and recognize insufficient medical evidence.
We evaluate our abstention approach using open-ended multi-round clinical
benchmarks that mimic realistic diagnostic scenarios, assessing abstention
quality through accuracy-efficiency trade-offs beyond existing closed-form
evaluations. Experimental evidences clearly demonstrate that KnowGuard
outperforms state-of-the-art abstention approaches, improving diagnostic
accuracy by 3.93\% while reducing unnecessary interaction by 7.27 turns on
average.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiaCDM is a novel cognitive diagnosis model designed for teacher-student dialogues, overcoming challenges of traditional CD models by using an adapted IRE framework and graph-based encoding to extract diagnostic semantics from unstructured dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cognitive diagnosis models are ineffective for real-world teacher-student dialogues due to their inability to handle dynamic, unstructured conversations and accurately extract diagnostic information from lengthy dialogues.

Method: Adapted the initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) framework from educational theory to create a dialogue-specific diagnostic framework, and developed a graph-based encoding method that integrates teacher questions with relevant knowledge components.

Result: Experiments on three real-world dialogue datasets showed that DiaCDM significantly improves diagnostic accuracy and enhances result interpretability compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: DiaCDM provides teachers with an effective tool for assessing students' cognitive states in dialogue settings, representing the first exploration of cognitive diagnosis in dialogue contexts.

Abstract: While cognitive diagnosis (CD) effectively assesses students' knowledge
mastery from structured test data, applying it to real-world teacher-student
dialogues presents two fundamental challenges. Traditional CD models lack a
suitable framework for handling dynamic, unstructured dialogues, and it's
difficult to accurately extract diagnostic semantics from lengthy dialogues. To
overcome these hurdles, we propose DiaCDM, an innovative model. We've adapted
the initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) framework from educational theory to
design a diagnostic framework tailored for dialogue. We also developed a unique
graph-based encoding method that integrates teacher questions with relevant
knowledge components to capture key information more precisely. To our
knowledge, this is the first exploration of cognitive diagnosis in a dialogue
setting. Experiments on three real-world dialogue datasets confirm that DiaCDM
not only significantly improves diagnostic accuracy but also enhances the
results' interpretability, providing teachers with a powerful tool for
assessing students' cognitive states. The code is available at

### [518] [SemShareKV: Efficient KVCache Sharing for Semantically Similar Prompts via Token-Level LSH Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24832)
*Xinye Zhao,Spyridon Mastorakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemShareKV is a KV cache sharing framework that accelerates LLM inference by reusing key-value caches from semantically similar prompts using fuzzy token matching with LSH and RoPE, achieving up to 6.25x speedup and 42% memory reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The memory footprint of KV caches during LLM inference has become a bottleneck, and existing compression methods are limited in handling semantically similar but lexically different prompts common in tasks like multi-document summarization and conversational agents.

Method: Uses fuzzy token matching with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) on token embeddings and incorporates Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to preserve positional information, selectively reusing relevant key-value pairs from reference prompts.

Result: Achieves up to 6.25x speedup and 42% lower GPU memory usage with 5k tokens input on summarization datasets, with negligible quality degradation.

Conclusion: Semantic-aware cache sharing shows significant potential for efficient LLM inference by reducing redundant computation while maintaining output quality.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, the memory footprint of
key-value (KV) caches during inference has become a significant bottleneck.
Existing approaches primarily focus on compressing KV caches within a single
prompt or reusing shared prefixes or frequently ocurred text segments across
prompts. However, such strategies are limited in scenarios where prompts are
semantically similar but lexically different, which frequently occurs in tasks
such as multi-document summarization and conversational agents. We propose
\textit{SemShareKV}, a KV cache sharing and compression framework that
accelerates LLM inference by reusing KVCache in semantically similar prompts.
Instead of relying on exact token matches, SemShareKV applies fuzzy token
matching using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) on token embeddings and
incorporates Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to better preserve positional
information. By selectively reusing relevant key-value pairs from a reference
prompt's cache, SemShareKV reduces redundant computation while maintaining
output quality. Experiments on diverse summarization datasets show up to
6.25$\times$ speedup and 42\% lower GPU memory usage with 5k tokens input, with
negligible quality degradation. These results highlight the potential of
semantic-aware cache sharing for efficient LLM inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC) framework to improve LLM performance in specialized domains by systematically analyzing and correcting hierarchical error patterns (Knowledge: 58.4%, Reasoning: 39.6%, Complexity: 2.0%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models perform poorly in specialized domains (only 45.9% accuracy on medical coding), requiring targeted intervention strategies for domain-specific limitations.

Method: Three-stage correction framework addressing errors by hierarchical importance: Knowledge-layer, Reasoning-layer, and Complexity-layer errors. Validated across medical transcription, legal classification, political bias detection, and legal reasoning tasks.

Result: Consistent improvements across domains with average 11.2 percentage point improvement (p < 0.001) across five LLM architectures. Framework effectiveness inversely correlates with baseline performance.

Conclusion: Systematic error analysis enables effective AI enhancement in specialized domains, particularly for moderate-baseline tasks, though framework has limitations in high-baseline tasks (>75% accuracy) where intervention may interfere with reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models face significant performance challenges in specialized
domains, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 45.9% accuracy on medical
coding tasks. This study proposes a Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC)
framework that addresses domain-specific AI limitations through systematic
error analysis and targeted intervention strategies.
  We analyze error patterns across four specialized domains and find that AI
errors follow consistent hierarchical structures: Knowledge-layer errors
(58.4%), Reasoning-layer errors (39.6%), and Complexity-layer errors (2.0%).
Based on these patterns, we develop a three-stage correction framework that
addresses errors according to their hierarchical importance and demonstrates
that framework effectiveness correlates inversely with baseline task
performance.
  Experimental validation across medical transcription (4,921 cases), legal
document classification (1,000 cases), political bias detection (645 cases),
and legal reasoning (1,000 cases) shows consistent improvements. Cross-model
validation across five LLM architectures demonstrates average improvements of
11.2 percentage points (p < 0.001). However, analysis reveals framework
limitations in high-baseline tasks (>75% accuracy), where hierarchical
intervention may interfere with effective reasoning processes.
  The results suggest that systematic error analysis can guide effective AI
enhancement strategies in specialized domains, particularly for
moderate-baseline tasks, while highlighting the importance of understanding
framework boundaries for optimal deployment.

*Adrian Arnaiz-Rodriguez,Miguel Baidal,Erik Derner,Jenn Layton Annable,Mark Ball,Mark Ince,Elvira Perez Vallejos,Nuria Oliver*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLMs' ability to handle mental health crises, finding they're generally reliable for explicit disclosures but have significant risks with indirect signals, inappropriate responses, and context misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in high-stakes mental health contexts, but their safety in detecting and responding to acute mental health crises remains poorly understood, hampered by lack of unified taxonomies and benchmarks.

Method: Introduced a unified taxonomy of six clinically-informed mental health crisis categories, curated a diverse evaluation dataset, established expert-designed assessment protocols, and systematically benchmarked three state-of-the-art LLMs for crisis classification and response generation.

Result: LLMs are highly consistent and generally reliable for explicit crisis disclosures, but show significant risks: non-negligible proportion of inappropriate/harmful responses, higher failure rates in open-weight models, weaknesses in handling indirect risk signals, formulaic replies, and context misalignment.

Conclusion: Urgent need for enhanced safeguards, improved crisis detection, and context-aware interventions in LLM deployments. The taxonomy, datasets, and evaluation framework provide groundwork for responsible AI-driven mental health support innovation.

Abstract: The widespread use of chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) such
as ChatGPT and Llama has fundamentally reshaped how people seek information and
advice across domains. Increasingly, these chatbots are being used in
high-stakes contexts, including emotional support and mental health concerns.
While LLMs can offer scalable support, their ability to safely detect and
respond to acute mental health crises remains poorly understood. Progress is
hampered by the absence of unified crisis taxonomies, robust annotated
benchmarks, and empirical evaluations grounded in clinical best practices. In
this work, we address these gaps by introducing a unified taxonomy of six
clinically-informed mental health crisis categories, curating a diverse
evaluation dataset, and establishing an expert-designed protocol for assessing
response appropriateness. We systematically benchmark three state-of-the-art
LLMs for their ability to classify crisis types and generate safe, appropriate
responses. The results reveal that while LLMs are highly consistent and
generally reliable in addressing explicit crisis disclosures, significant risks
remain. A non-negligible proportion of responses are rated as inappropriate or
harmful, with responses generated by an open-weight model exhibiting higher
failure rates than those generated by the commercial ones. We also identify
systemic weaknesses in handling indirect or ambiguous risk signals, a reliance
on formulaic and inauthentic default replies, and frequent misalignment with
user context. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced
safeguards, improved crisis detection, and context-aware interventions in LLM
deployments. Our taxonomy, datasets, and evaluation framework lay the
groundwork for ongoing research and responsible innovation in AI-driven mental
health support, helping to minimize harm and better protect vulnerable users.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can automate metaphor identification in texts with high accuracy, achieving median F1 score of 0.79 through fine-tuning, and serve as testbeds for refining metaphor theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation constrains large-scale metaphor analysis due to its context-sensitive nature, creating need for automated identification methods.

Method: Compared three approaches: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), prompt engineering (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought), and fine-tuning LLMs on hand-coded texts.

Result: State-of-the-art closed-source LLMs achieved high accuracy, with fine-tuning yielding median F1 score of 0.79. Discrepancies between human and LLM outputs were systematic and reflected known theoretical challenges.

Conclusion: LLMs can partly automate metaphor identification and serve as testbeds for developing and refining metaphor identification protocols and underlying theory.

Abstract: Metaphor is a pervasive feature of discourse and a powerful lens for
examining cognition, emotion, and ideology. Large-scale analysis, however, has
been constrained by the need for manual annotation due to the context-sensitive
nature of metaphor. This study investigates the potential of large language
models (LLMs) to automate metaphor identification in full texts. We compare
three methods: (i) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the model is
provided with a codebook and instructed to annotate texts based on its rules
and examples; (ii) prompt engineering, where we design task-specific verbal
instructions; and (iii) fine-tuning, where the model is trained on hand-coded
texts to optimize performance. Within prompt engineering, we test zero-shot,
few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies. Our results show that
state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs can achieve high accuracy, with fine-tuning
yielding a median F1 score of 0.79. A comparison of human and LLM outputs
reveals that most discrepancies are systematic, reflecting well-known grey
areas and conceptual challenges in metaphor theory. We propose that LLMs can be
used to at least partly automate metaphor identification and can serve as a
testbed for developing and refining metaphor identification protocols and the
theory that underpins them.

*Yoonna Jang,Kisu Yang,Isabelle Augenstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models can use artificially inserted filler tokens at inference time as additional computational space, improving performance especially for smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models can leverage artificially inserted filler tokens solely at inference time as additional computation space, building on prior work that trained filler tokens.

Method: Experiments on models from 1.7B to 32B parameters across open-domain QA and math tasks, identifying effective token types, numbers, and insertion locations, and analyzing attention dynamics.

Result: Appropriate token types and counts vary, but placing filler tokens directly before the final 'Answer:' token is most effective. Smaller models benefit most (up to 12.372 percentage points improvement), and attention maps show meaningful computation in expanded spaces.

Conclusion: Filler tokens act as additional computational capacity rather than redundant input, with expanded spaces continuing original attention mechanisms and focusing on problem-solving elements.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationale enables language models to use additional
task-related text for problem-solving, benefiting not only from detailed
reasoning steps but also from the expanded computational space of longer
inputs. Prior work has trained filler or special tokens to serve as additional
computation spaces. In this study, we investigate whether language models can
leverage artificially inserted sequences of filler tokens solely at inference.
We first identify effective token types, numbers, and insertion locations, then
examine at what stage of training models begin to exploit the expanded
computation space, and finally analyze dynamics within these spaces via
attention maps. Experiments on models ranging from 1.7B to 32B across
open-domain QA and math tasks show that appropriate token types and counts
vary, but placing filler tokens directly before the final 'Answer:' token is
most effective. Smaller models benefit most, up to 12.372 percentage points in
SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct, indicating that these spaces act as additional
computational capacity rather than redundant input. Attention maps reveal that
expanded spaces often continue the original attention mechanism and sometimes
focus on questions or answer options, suggesting meaningful computation for
problem-solving.

TL;DR: BOE-XSUM dataset with 3,648 Spanish legal document summaries enables fine-tuned LLMs to outperform zero-shot models by 24% in summarization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address information overload and lack of Spanish legal document summaries by creating a specialized dataset for the legal domain.

Method: Create BOE-XSUM dataset from Spain's Official Gazette, fine-tune medium-sized LLMs on it, and compare with zero-shot general-purpose models.

Result: Fine-tuned models significantly outperform zero-shot models, with BERTIN GPT-J 6B achieving 41.6% accuracy vs 33.5% for DeepSeek-R1 (24% performance gain).

Conclusion: Domain-specific fine-tuning on curated datasets like BOE-XSUM substantially improves summarization performance for Spanish legal documents compared to general-purpose models.

Abstract: The ability to summarize long documents succinctly is increasingly important
in daily life due to information overload, yet there is a notable lack of such
summaries for Spanish documents in general, and in the legal domain in
particular. In this work, we present BOE-XSUM, a curated dataset comprising
3,648 concise, plain-language summaries of documents sourced from Spain's
``Bolet\'{\i}n Oficial del Estado'' (BOE), the State Official Gazette. Each
entry in the dataset includes a short summary, the original text, and its
document type label. We evaluate the performance of medium-sized large language
models (LLMs) fine-tuned on BOE-XSUM, comparing them to general-purpose
generative models in a zero-shot setting. Results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their non-specialized counterparts. Notably, the
best-performing model -- BERTIN GPT-J 6B (32-bit precision) -- achieves a 24\%
performance gain over the top zero-shot model, DeepSeek-R1 (accuracies of
41.6\% vs.\ 33.5\%).

Motivation: To evaluate whether large language models can effectively replicate specific human author styles and develop a fast, efficient method for authorship verification without requiring supervised training.

Method: Integrates TF-IDF character n-grams with transformer embeddings and classifies text pairs through empirical distance distributions, eliminating supervised training or threshold tuning. Evaluated five LLMs across four prompting strategies.

Result: Achieved 97.5% accuracy on academic essays and 94.5% in cross-domain evaluation, with 91.8% training time reduction and 59% memory usage reduction. Few-shot prompting yielded 23.5x higher style-matching than zero-shot, and completion prompting reached 99.9% agreement with original author style.

Conclusion: Prompting strategy has greater influence on style fidelity than model size, and high-fidelity imitation doesn't imply human-like unpredictability. Stylistic fidelity and statistical detectability are separable, providing basis for future authorship modeling and detection work.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, but their ability to
replicate the distinctive style of a specific human author remains unclear. We
present a fast, training-free framework for authorship verification and style
imitation analysis. The method integrates TF-IDF character n-grams with
transformer embeddings and classifies text pairs through empirical distance
distributions, eliminating the need for supervised training or threshold
tuning. It achieves 97.5\% accuracy on academic essays and 94.5\% in
cross-domain evaluation, while reducing training time by 91.8\% and memory
usage by 59\% relative to parameter-based baselines. Using this framework, we
evaluate five LLMs from three separate families (Llama, Qwen, Mixtral) across
four prompting strategies - zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, and text completion.
Results show that the prompting strategy has a more substantial influence on
style fidelity than model size: few-shot prompting yields up to 23.5x higher
style-matching accuracy than zero-shot, and completion prompting reaches 99.9\%
agreement with the original author's style. Crucially, high-fidelity imitation
does not imply human-like unpredictability - human essays average a perplexity
of 29.5, whereas matched LLM outputs average only 15.2. These findings
demonstrate that stylistic fidelity and statistical detectability are
separable, establishing a reproducible basis for future work in authorship
modeling, detection, and identity-conditioned generation.

*Changsheng Zhao,Ernie Chang,Zechun Liu,Chia-Jung Chang,Wei Wen,Chen Lai,Rick Cao,Yuandong Tian,Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi,Yangyang Shi,Vikas Chandra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Strong reasoning capabilities can emerge in sub-billion-parameter models with only ~2T tokens of carefully curated high-quality data, challenging the assumption that massive datasets (>10T tokens) are necessary for reasoning emergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the prevailing assumption that reasoning capabilities in LLMs require training on massive datasets (>10T tokens), showing that high-quality data curation can enable reasoning emergence with far less data.

Method: Carefully curate and resample open-source datasets using designed metrics to identify beneficial data, then pre-train on 4.2T tokens resampled from ~2T high-quality tokens, followed by established post-training procedures.

Result: MobileLLM-R1-950M achieves AIME score of 15.5 vs 0.6 for OLMo-2-1.48B and 0.3 for SmolLM-2-1.7B, and matches/surpasses Qwen3-0.6B despite using only 11.7% of Qwen3's tokens.

Conclusion: Reasoning capabilities can emerge with far less data than previously assumed through careful data curation, enabling efficient development of sub-billion-parameter reasoning models.

Abstract: The paradigm shift in large language models (LLMs) from instinctive responses
to chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has fueled two prevailing assumptions: (1)
reasoning capabilities only emerge in sufficiently large models, and (2) such
capabilities require training on massive datasets. While the first assumption
has already been challenged by recent sub-billion-parameter reasoning models
such as Qwen3-0.6B and DeepSeek distilled variants, the second remains largely
unquestioned. In this work, we revisit the necessity of scaling to extremely
large corpora (>10T tokens) for reasoning emergence. By carefully curating and
resampling open-source datasets that we identify as beneficial under our
designed metrics, we demonstrate that strong reasoning abilities can emerge
with far less data. Specifically, we show that only ~2T tokens of high-quality
data are sufficient, and pre-training with 4.2T tokens on the dataset resampled
from these ~2T tokens, followed by a established post-training procedure,
enables the development of MobileLLM-R1, a series of sub-billion-parameter
reasoning models that substantially outperform prior models trained on fully
open-sourced data. For example, MobileLLM-R1-950M achieves an AIME score of
15.5, compared to just 0.6 for OLMo-2-1.48B and 0.3 for SmolLM-2-1.7B.
Remarkably, despite being trained on only 11.7% of the tokens compared to
Qwen3's proprietary 36T-token corpus for pretraining, MobileLLM-R1-950M matches
or surpasses Qwen3-0.6B across multiple reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate
further research in this direction, we have released the complete training
recipe, data sources, data mixing ratio, and model checkpoints, together with
the key insights obtained throughout this study.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAQuE is the largest benchmark for evaluating medical multi-turn questioning AI, featuring 3,000 simulated patient agents with diverse characteristics and a comprehensive evaluation framework covering multiple aspects of doctor-patient interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI doctors focus mainly on diagnostic skills and information seeking, but overlook other essential physician qualities like empathy, patience, and clear communication that are crucial for effective patient care.

Method: Created MAQuE benchmark with 3,000 realistically simulated patient agents exhibiting diverse linguistic patterns, cognitive limitations, emotional responses, and passive disclosure tendencies. Introduced multi-faceted evaluation framework covering task success, inquiry proficiency, dialogue competence, inquiry efficiency, and patient experience.

Result: Experiments show substantial challenges across evaluation aspects. State-of-the-art models have significant room for improvement in inquiry capabilities and are highly sensitive to realistic patient behavior variations, which considerably impacts diagnostic accuracy. Fine-grained metrics reveal trade-offs between different evaluation perspectives.

Conclusion: Balancing performance and practicality in real-world clinical settings is challenging, as current models struggle with comprehensive physician qualities beyond diagnostic skills, highlighting the need for more holistic AI doctor development.

Abstract: An effective physician should possess a combination of empathy, expertise,
patience, and clear communication when treating a patient. Recent advances have
successfully endowed AI doctors with expert diagnostic skills, particularly the
ability to actively seek information through inquiry. However, other essential
qualities of a good doctor remain overlooked. To bridge this gap, we present
MAQuE(Medical Agent Questioning Evaluation), the largest-ever benchmark for the
automatic and comprehensive evaluation of medical multi-turn questioning. It
features 3,000 realistically simulated patient agents that exhibit diverse
linguistic patterns, cognitive limitations, emotional responses, and tendencies
for passive disclosure. We also introduce a multi-faceted evaluation framework,
covering task success, inquiry proficiency, dialogue competence, inquiry
efficiency, and patient experience. Experiments on different LLMs reveal
substantial challenges across the evaluation aspects. Even state-of-the-art
models show significant room for improvement in their inquiry capabilities.
These models are highly sensitive to variations in realistic patient behavior,
which considerably impacts diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, our fine-grained
metrics expose trade-offs between different evaluation perspectives,
highlighting the challenge of balancing performance and practicality in
real-world clinical settings.

*Kaihong Li,Huichi Zhou,Bin Ma,Fangjun Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemanticShield is a two-stage framework that uses LLMs to detect shilling attacks in recommender systems by analyzing item-side semantic features alongside user behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recommender system defenses focus mainly on user behaviors but overlook item-side features like titles and descriptions that can reveal malicious intent in shilling attacks.

Method: Two-stage detection: first pre-screens suspicious users using behavioral criteria, then employs LLM-based auditing to evaluate semantic consistency. The LLM is enhanced through reinforcement fine-tuning with specialized reward functions.

Result: Experiments on six attack strategies show SemanticShield effectively detects shilling attacks, and it demonstrates strong generalization capability against previously unseen attack methods.

Conclusion: Integrating item-side semantics via LLMs provides an effective defense against shilling attacks in recommender systems, with SemanticShield showing robust detection performance and generalization ability.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) are widely used in e-commerce for personalized
suggestions, yet their openness makes them susceptible to shilling attacks,
where adversaries inject fake behaviors to manipulate recommendations. Most
existing defenses emphasize user-side behaviors while overlooking item-side
features such as titles and descriptions that can expose malicious intent. To
address this gap, we propose a two-stage detection framework that integrates
item-side semantics via large language models (LLMs). The first stage
pre-screens suspicious users using low-cost behavioral criteria, and the second
stage employs LLM-based auditing to evaluate semantic consistency. Furthermore,
we enhance the auditing model through reinforcement fine-tuning on a
lightweight LLM with carefully designed reward functions, yielding a
specialized detector called SemanticShield. Experiments on six representative
attack strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of SemanticShield against
shilling attacks, and further evaluation on previously unseen attack methods
shows its strong generalization capability. Code is available at

### [528] [Generalized Correctness Models: Learning Calibrated and Model-Agnostic Correctness Predictors from Historical Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24988)
*Hanqi Xiao,Vaidehi Patil,Hyunji Lee,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs cannot reliably predict their own correctness better than unrelated models. Training models on historical correctness data from multiple LLMs creates generalizable correctness prediction skills across datasets and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate confidence estimation is critical for deploying LLMs in high-stakes applications, but current self-knowledge approaches assume privileged information about correctness that may not exist.

Method: Proposed Generalized Correctness Models (GCMs) trained on historical correctness data from multiple LLMs, with systematic control of training data and exploration of alternative methods like in-context examples and post-hoc calibration.

Result: GCMs based on Qwen3-8B performed well across 5 model families and datasets, showing that correctness prediction is a generalizable skill learned from historical data rather than model-specific introspection.

Conclusion: Reliable LLM confidence estimation comes from systematically encoding correctness history rather than self-introspection, making it a generalizable and model-agnostic skill.

Abstract: Generating accurate and calibrated confidence estimates is critical for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes or user-facing applications, and remains an open
challenge. Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting
a model's "self-knowledge", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its
own answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some
privileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the
model itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict
the correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an
unrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a
"Correctness Model" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical
predictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness
information, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that
GCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns
for correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use
CMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its
generalization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that
answer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore
alternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that
including history as in-context examples can help improve correctness
prediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in
calibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families
and the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective
prediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a
generalizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding
correctness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on
self-introspection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Circuit distillation aligns internal representations between teacher and student models' circuit components, outperforming standard behavioral mimicry distillation on entity tracking and theory of mind tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard model distillation treats teacher models as black boxes, focusing only on output mimicry. This work aims to distill the underlying computational mechanisms implemented by teachers.

Method: Proposes circuit distillation with an objective to align internal representations between functionally correspondent circuit components in teacher and student models, using a loss reflecting representation similarities.

Result: Circuit distillation outperforms standard distillation on entity tracking and theory of mind tasks using Llama3 family models, successfully transferring algorithmic capabilities by adjusting only a small, targeted subset of parameters.

Conclusion: Establishes feasibility of transferring mechanisms, enabling efficient distillation of targeted teacher capabilities via interpretable and controllable internal student mechanisms.

Abstract: Model distillation typically focuses on behavioral mimicry, where a student
model is trained to replicate a teacher's output while treating its internal
computations as a black box. In this work we propose an alternative approach:
Distilling the underlying computational mechanisms implemented by a teacher
model. Specifically, we propose circuit distillation, which introduces an
objective to align internal representations between analogous circuit
components in teacher and student models. We propose a method to match
``functionally correspondent'' circuit components and introduce a loss
reflecting similarities between the representations that these induce. We
evaluate circuit distillation on entity tracking and theory of mind (ToM) tasks
using models from the Llama3 family. Our results demonstrate that circuit
distillation outperforms standard distillation, successfully transferring
algorithmic capabilities by adjusting only a small, targeted subset of student
model parameters. This work establishes the feasibility of transferring
mechanisms, which may in turn allow for efficient distillation of targeted
teacher capabilities via interpretable and controllable internal student
mechanisms.

Conclusion: DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective distillation method that enables fast language generation while maintaining high performance and training efficiency.

Abstract: Fast generation of language texts is the holy grail that people pursue in the
AI era. In this work, we introduced Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct
(DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that leads to fast language generation
models by initializing from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language
model (dLLM). The resulting DiDi-Instruct model outperforms the dLLM
counterparts and the GPT-2 baseline with 64x acceleration. In the theoretical
part of the paper, we build the foundation of DiDi-Instruct in a framework of
integral KL-divergence minimization, with practical training algorithms. We
also introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state
matching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly
improve the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference
performances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated
language generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard
dLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128
NFEs). These performance gains are accomplished with a negligible entropy loss
of about 1% and 20x less additional training wall-clock time. We further
validate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive
ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein
sequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective
distillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye. We
will release both code and models at github.com/haoyangzheng-ai/didi-instruct.

Motivation: Existing multimodal ABSA models struggle with filtering noisy visual signals and effectively aligning aspects with opinion-bearing content across text and image modalities.

Method: Proposes GateMABSA with three specialized mLSTMs: Syn-mLSTM for syntactic structure, Sem-mLSTM for aspect-semantic relevance, and Fuse-mLSTM for selective multimodal fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmark Twitter datasets demonstrate that GateMABSA outperforms several baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed gated multimodal architecture effectively addresses challenges in multimodal ABSA by integrating syntactic, semantic, and fusion-aware components.

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has recently advanced into the
multimodal domain, where user-generated content often combines text and images.
However, existing multimodal ABSA (MABSA) models struggle to filter noisy
visual signals, and effectively align aspects with opinion-bearing content
across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose GateMABSA, a novel
gated multimodal architecture that integrates syntactic, semantic, and
fusion-aware mLSTM. Specifically, GateMABSA introduces three specialized
mLSTMs: Syn-mLSTM to incorporate syntactic structure, Sem-mLSTM to emphasize
aspect--semantic relevance, and Fuse-mLSTM to perform selective multimodal
fusion. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Twitter datasets demonstrate
that GateMABSA outperforms several baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces Hyperdimensional Probe, a novel method for decoding LLM internal representations using Vector Symbolic Architectures to extract interpretable concepts from the residual stream.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interpretability methods like DLA and SAEs provide limited insight into LLM representations due to vocabulary constraints and unclear feature names.

Method: Projects the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts using Vector Symbolic Architectures, combining strengths of SAEs and conventional probes.

Result: Reliably extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input domains, and helps identify LLM failures in controlled tasks and question-answering settings.

Conclusion: Advances information decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extraction of more informative, interpretable, and structured features from neural representations.

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain opaque with
limited understanding of their internal representations. Current
interpretability methods, such as direct logit attribution (DLA) and sparse
autoencoders (SAEs), provide restricted insight due to limitations such as the
model's output vocabulary or unclear feature names. This work introduces
Hyperdimensional Probe, a novel paradigm for decoding information from the LLM
vector space. It combines ideas from symbolic representations and neural
probing to project the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts via
Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). This probe combines the strengths of SAEs
and conventional probes while overcoming their key limitations. We validate our
decoding paradigm with controlled input-completion tasks, probing the model's
final state before next-token prediction on inputs spanning syntactic pattern
recognition, key-value associations, and abstract inference. We further assess
it in a question-answering setting, examining the state of the model both
before and after text generation. Our experiments show that our probe reliably
extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input
domains, also helping identify LLM failures. Our work advances information
decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extracting more informative,
interpretable, and structured features from neural representations.

Motivation: To improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) error correction for disordered speech by leveraging LLMs as post-processing modules, addressing the challenge of robust generalization across different speakers and datasets.

Method: Proposed confidence-informed prompting where word-level uncertainty estimates are embedded directly into LLM training, fine-tuned LLaMA 3.1 model, and compared with transcript-only fine-tuning and post hoc confidence-based filtering.

Result: Achieved 10% relative WER reduction on Speech Accessibility Project spontaneous speech and 47% reduction on TORGO compared to naive LLM correction.

Conclusion: Confidence-aware fine-tuning is effective for impaired speech ASR error correction, demonstrating significant improvements in word error rate reduction across different datasets.

Abstract: We investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) as post-processing
modules for automatic speech recognition (ASR), focusing on their ability to
perform error correction for disordered speech. In particular, we propose
confidence-informed prompting, where word-level uncertainty estimates are
embedded directly into LLM training to improve robustness and generalization
across speakers and datasets. This approach directs the model to uncertain ASR
regions and reduces overcorrection. We fine-tune a LLaMA 3.1 model and compare
our approach to both transcript-only fine-tuning and post hoc confidence-based
filtering. Evaluations show that our method achieves a 10% relative WER
reduction compared to naive LLM correction on the Speech Accessibility Project
spontaneous speech and a 47% reduction on TORGO, demonstrating the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study Transformers on program trace generation, which externalizes reasoning through long execution traces where each step is simple, unlike existing algorithmic problems.

Method: Train small Transformers with diverse modifications including alternative position encodings, softmax replacements, hybrid models, and short convolutions on the program trace generation task.

Result: Models achieve strong in-distribution accuracy but exhibit systematic failures when generalizing to various factors like program length and trace steps, though some architectural designs significantly improve generalization.

Conclusion: While Transformers can perform well on program trace generation in-distribution, they struggle with systematic generalization, but certain architectural modifications can enhance their generalization capabilities.

Abstract: We study Transformers on the task \emph{program trace generation} (PTG),
where models produce step-by-step execution traces for synthetic programs.
Unlike existing algorithmic problems, PTG externalizes reasoning through long
traces where each step is trivial. We train small Transformers with diverse
modifications, including alternative position encodings, softmax replacements,
hybrid model, and short convolutions. While these models achieve strong
in-distribution accuracy, they exhibit systematic failures when generalizing to

Abstract: Data-analytic agents are emerging as a key catalyst for automated scientific
discovery and for the vision of Innovating AI. Current approaches, however,
rely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source
models struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and
long-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This
paper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe
designed to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key
challenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient
data resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn
rollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a
recursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and
difficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling
strategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically
adjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a
memory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on
DataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning
diverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic
tasks. Trained on DataMind-12K, our DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art with
an average score of 71.16% on multiple data analysis benchmarks, outperforming
the strongest proprietary baselines DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. Our DataMind-7B
also performs best among all open-source models with a score of 68.10%. We also
incorporate some empirical insights gained from our exploratory trials into the
analysis experiments, aiming to provide actionable insights about agentic
training for the community. We will release DataMind-12K and DataMind-7B,14B
for the community's future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in real-world LS application: privacy-sensitive environments, resource constraints, and safety concerns for vulnerable user groups like people with disabilities.

Method: Utilizes small LLMs deployable locally, explores knowledge distillation with synthesized data and in-context learning as baselines, and proposes filtering strategy using model's output probability to detect harmful simplifications.

Result: Knowledge distillation boosts automatic metrics but increases harmful simplifications. Model's output probability effectively detects harmful simplifications. Filtering strategy suppresses harmful outputs while preserving beneficial ones.

Conclusion: Establishes benchmark for efficient and safe LS with small LLMs, highlighting performance-efficiency-safety trade-offs and demonstrating promising approach for safe real-world deployment.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance, large language models (LLMs) face
challenges in real-world application of lexical simplification (LS),
particularly in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments.
Moreover, since vulnerable user groups (e.g., people with disabilities) are one
of the key target groups of this technology, it is crucial to ensure the safety
and correctness of the output of LS systems. To address these issues, we
propose an efficient framework for LS systems that utilizes small LLMs
deployable in local environments. Within this framework, we explore knowledge
distillation with synthesized data and in-context learning as baselines. Our
experiments in five languages evaluate model outputs both automatically and
manually. Our manual analysis reveals that while knowledge distillation boosts
automatic metric scores, it also introduces a safety trade-off by increasing
harmful simplifications. Importantly, we find that the model's output
probability is a useful signal for detecting harmful simplifications.
Leveraging this, we propose a filtering strategy that suppresses harmful
simplifications while largely preserving beneficial ones. This work establishes
a benchmark for efficient and safe LS with small LLMs. It highlights the key
trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and safety, and demonstrates a
promising approach for safe real-world deployment.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) can autonomously conduct complex investigations
and generate comprehensive reports, demonstrating strong real-world potential.
However, existing evaluations mostly rely on close-ended benchmarks, while
open-ended deep research benchmarks remain scarce and typically neglect
personalized scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Personalized Deep
Research Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating personalization in DRAs. It
pairs 50 diverse research tasks across 10 domains with 25 authentic user
profiles that combine structured persona attributes with dynamic real-world
contexts, yielding 250 realistic user-task queries. To assess system
performance, we propose the PQR Evaluation Framework, which jointly measures
(P) Personalization Alignment, (Q) Content Quality, and (R) Factual
Reliability. Our experiments on a range of systems highlight current
capabilities and limitations in handling personalized deep research. This work
establishes a rigorous foundation for developing and evaluating the next
generation of truly personalized AI research assistants.

*Ivan Vykopal,Antonia Karamolegkou,Jaroslav Kopčan,Qiwei Peng,Tomáš Javůrek,Michal Gregor,Marián Šimko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies language and retrieval bias in multilingual LLMs for fact-checking, finding performance disparities across languages and skewed retrieval favoring popular claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual LLMs show language bias, performing better on high-resource languages than low-resource ones, and retrieval systems exhibit bias by favoring certain information over others.

Method: Evaluated six open-source multilingual LLMs across 20 languages using multilingual prompting on AMC-16K dataset, and analyzed retrieval bias using multilingual embedding models and claim frequency analysis.

Result: Found persistent bias in LLM behavior with performance disparities across languages, and identified that certain claims are retrieved disproportionately, inflating performance for popular claims while under-representing less common ones.

Conclusion: Highlights persistent bias issues in multilingual fact-checking and offers recommendations for improving equity, emphasizing the need to address both language and retrieval biases.

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities for
cross-lingual fact-checking. However, these models often exhibit language bias,
performing disproportionately better on high-resource languages such as English
than on low-resource counterparts. We also present and inspect a novel concept
- retrieval bias, when information retrieval systems tend to favor certain
information over others, leaving the retrieval process skewed. In this paper,
we study language and retrieval bias in the context of Previously Fact-Checked
Claim Detection (PFCD). We evaluate six open-source multilingual LLMs across 20
languages using a fully multilingual prompting strategy, leveraging the AMC-16K
dataset. By translating task prompts into each language, we uncover disparities
in monolingual and cross-lingual performance and identify key trends based on
model family, size, and prompting strategy. Our findings highlight persistent
bias in LLM behavior and offer recommendations for improving equity in
multilingual fact-checking. To investigate retrieval bias, we employed
multilingual embedding models and look into the frequency of retrieved claims.
Our analysis reveals that certain claims are retrieved disproportionately
across different posts, leading to inflated retrieval performance for popular
claims while under-representing less common ones.

TL;DR: PbT is a teacher-student pipeline that synthesizes accurate input-output pairs without human labels or parallel data by compressing unpaired examples into intermediate representations and training students to reconstruct inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge in low-resource NLG scenarios where practitioners have only raw outputs (highlights, recaps) or only raw inputs (articles, dialogues) but rarely both, forcing small models to learn from few examples or rely on costly LLM-generated synthetic data.

Method: Two-stage teacher-student pipeline: teacher LLM compresses unpaired examples into concise intermediate representations (IRs), then student is trained to reconstruct inputs from IRs, enabling outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs to create synthetic data.

Result: 8B student trained only on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70B teacher-generated corpora and other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated pairs and closing 82% of oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of direct synthesis.

Conclusion: PbT produces concise, faithful summaries aligned with target style by generating in-domain sources that avoid the mismatch issues limiting direct synthesis, as confirmed by human evaluation on SwitchBoard.

Abstract: We present Paired by the Teacher (PbT), a two-stage teacher-student pipeline
that synthesizes accurate input-output pairs without human labels or parallel
data. In many low-resource natural language generation (NLG) scenarios,
practitioners may have only raw outputs, like highlights, recaps, or questions,
or only raw inputs, such as articles, dialogues, or paragraphs, but seldom
both. This mismatch forces small models to learn from very few examples or rely
on costly, broad-scope synthetic examples produced by large LLMs. PbT addresses
this by asking a teacher LLM to compress each unpaired example into a concise
intermediate representation (IR), and training a student to reconstruct inputs
from IRs. This enables outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs,
yielding high-quality synthetic data. We evaluate PbT on five
benchmarks-document summarization (XSum, CNNDM), dialogue summarization
(SAMSum, DialogSum), and question generation (SQuAD)-as well as an unpaired
setting on SwitchBoard (paired with DialogSum summaries). An 8B student trained
only on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70 B teacher-generated corpora
and other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated
pairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of
direct synthesis. Human evaluation on SwitchBoard further confirms that only
PbT produces concise, faithful summaries aligned with the target style,
highlighting its advantage of generating in-domain sources that avoid the
mismatch, limiting direct synthesis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for stable 4-bit floating point (FP4) training of large language models using NVFP4 format, achieving comparable performance to FP8 baseline while significantly improving computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training frontier LLMs requires massive computational resources (tens to hundreds of yottaflops), making pretraining efficiency essential for developing more capable models. While FP8 training is widely adopted, transitioning to narrower FP4 precision could unlock additional computational speed and resource utilization benefits.

Method: The approach integrates Random Hadamard transforms to bound block-level outliers, uses two-dimensional quantization for consistent forward/backward pass representations, employs stochastic rounding for unbiased gradient estimation, and incorporates selective high-precision layers.

Result: The method was validated by training a 12-billion-parameter model on 10 trillion tokens - the longest publicly documented FP4 training run. The model achieved training loss and downstream task accuracies comparable to FP8 baseline.

Conclusion: NVFP4 combined with the proposed training approach represents a major step forward in narrow-precision LLM training algorithms, enabling efficient 4-bit training without sacrificing model performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) today are powerful problem solvers across many
domains, and they continue to get stronger as they scale in model size,
training set size, and training set quality, as shown by extensive research and
experimentation across the industry. Training a frontier model today requires
on the order of tens to hundreds of yottaflops, which is a massive investment
of time, compute, and energy. Improving pretraining efficiency is therefore
essential to enable the next generation of even more capable LLMs. While 8-bit
floating point (FP8) training is now widely adopted, transitioning to even
narrower precision, such as 4-bit floating point (FP4), could unlock additional
improvements in computational speed and resource utilization. However,
quantization at this level poses challenges to training stability, convergence,
and implementation, notably for large-scale models trained on long token
horizons.
  In this study, we introduce a novel approach for stable and accurate training
of large language models (LLMs) using the NVFP4 format. Our method integrates
Random Hadamard transforms (RHT) to bound block-level outliers, employs a
two-dimensional quantization scheme for consistent representations across both
the forward and backward passes, utilizes stochastic rounding for unbiased
gradient estimation, and incorporates selective high-precision layers. We
validate our approach by training a 12-billion-parameter model on 10 trillion
tokens -- the longest publicly documented training run in 4-bit precision to
date. Our results show that the model trained with our NVFP4-based pretraining
technique achieves training loss and downstream task accuracies comparable to
an FP8 baseline. These findings highlight that NVFP4, when combined with our
training approach, represents a major step forward in narrow-precision LLM
training algorithms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NAIPv2 is a debiased and efficient framework for paper quality estimation that uses pairwise learning within domain-year groups to address scale inconsistencies in reviewer ratings, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining linear-time inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based paper quality estimation methods have high inference costs, while faster direct score regression approaches suffer from scale inconsistencies in reviewer ratings.

Method: NAIPv2 employs pairwise learning within domain-year groups to reduce rating inconsistencies and introduces Review Tendency Signal (RTS) as a probabilistic integration of reviewer scores and confidences. It's trained on pairwise comparisons but enables efficient pointwise prediction at deployment.

Conclusion: NAIPv2 establishes a debiased and scalable framework for automated paper quality estimation, representing progress toward future scientific intelligence systems.

Abstract: The ability to estimate the quality of scientific papers is central to how
both humans and AI systems will advance scientific knowledge in the future.
However, existing LLM-based estimation methods suffer from high inference cost,
whereas the faster direct score regression approach is limited by scale
inconsistencies. We present NAIPv2, a debiased and efficient framework for

groups to reduce inconsistencies in reviewer ratings and introduces the Review
Tendency Signal (RTS) as a probabilistic integration of reviewer scores and
confidences. To support training and evaluation, we further construct NAIDv2, a
large-scale dataset of 24,276 ICLR submissions enriched with metadata and
detailed structured content. Trained on pairwise comparisons but enabling
efficient pointwise prediction at deployment, NAIPv2 achieves state-of-the-art

TL;DR: TTS is an incentive-aligned framework for truthful text summarization that decomposes claims, scores sources using peer-prediction, and filters unreliable sources to improve factual accuracy without ground-truth labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based search and answer systems have weak incentives for source accuracy and are vulnerable to adversarial content, leading to unreliable synthesized responses.

Method: Four-step framework: (1) decompose draft synthesis into atomic claims, (2) elicit each source's stance on claims, (3) score sources using multi-task peer-prediction that rewards informative agreement, (4) filter unreliable sources before re-summarizing.

Result: TTS improves factual accuracy and robustness while preserving fluency, aligns exposure with informative corroboration, and disincentivizes manipulation.

Conclusion: The framework provides formal guarantees that make truthful reporting the utility-maximizing strategy for sources, creating an incentive-aligned system for reliable text summarization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in modern search and
answer systems to synthesize multiple, sometimes conflicting, texts into a
single response, yet current pipelines offer weak incentives for sources to be
accurate and are vulnerable to adversarial content. We introduce Truthful Text
Summarization (TTS), an incentive-aligned framework that improves factual
robustness without ground-truth labels. TTS (i) decomposes a draft synthesis
into atomic claims, (ii) elicits each source's stance on every claim, (iii)
scores sources with an adapted multi-task peer-prediction mechanism that
rewards informative agreement, and (iv) filters unreliable sources before
re-summarizing. We establish formal guarantees that align a source's incentives
with informative honesty, making truthful reporting the utility-maximizing
strategy. Experiments show that TTS improves factual accuracy and robustness
while preserving fluency, aligning exposure with informative corroboration and
disincentivizing manipulation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Learn2PD is a framework that trains a lightweight adaptive filter model to enable dynamic parallel decoding in diffusion-based LLMs, achieving significant speedup without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autoregressive decoding in LLMs is slow due to sequential processing, while current parallel decoding methods use fixed heuristics that don't adapt to input characteristics, leading to suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs.

Method: Proposes Learn2PD framework with a lightweight filter model trained to predict when token predictions match final output, plus End-of-Text Prediction to detect completion and avoid redundant padding token decoding.

Result: Achieves up to 22.58× speedup without performance drop on LLaDA benchmark, and up to 57.51× speedup when combined with KV-Cache.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective dynamic parallel decoding approach that adapts to input characteristics and significantly improves inference throughput while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ sequential steps for $n$ tokens, fundamentally limiting
inference throughput. Recent diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) enable parallel token
generation through iterative denoising. However, current parallel decoding
strategies rely on fixed, input-agnostic heuristics (e.g., confidence
thresholds), which fail to adapt to input-specific characteristics, resulting
in suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs across diverse NLP tasks. In this work,
we explore a more flexible and dynamic approach to parallel decoding. We
propose Learning to Parallel Decode (Learn2PD), a framework that trains a
lightweight and adaptive filter model to predict, for each token position,
whether the current prediction matches the final output. This learned filter
approximates an oracle parallel decoding strategy that unmasks tokens only when
correctly predicted. Importantly, the filter model is learned in a
post-training manner, requiring only a small amount of computation to optimize
it (minute-level GPU time). Additionally, we introduce End-of-Text Prediction
(EoTP) to detect decoding completion at the end of sequence, avoiding redundant
decoding of padding tokens. Experiments on the LLaDA benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves up to 22.58$\times$ speedup without any performance drop,
and up to 57.51$\times$ when combined with KV-Cache.

Conclusion: InfoAgent demonstrates that systematic data synthesis, dedicated search infrastructure, and two-stage training can significantly enhance LLM agent capabilities for deep research tasks, setting new benchmarks for open-source research agents.

Abstract: Building Large Language Model agents that expand their capabilities by
interacting with external tools represents a new frontier in AI research and
applications. In this paper, we introduce InfoAgent, a deep research agent
powered by an innovative data synthesis pipeline and orchestrated web search
tools. To construct challenging, hard-to-find queries,we build entity trees and
apply sub-tree sampling with entity fuzzification to systematically increase

tools, we develop a dedicated self-hosted search infrastructure, enhancing
transparency of agent environments and facilitating further advancement of

the average number of tool calls required to correctly answer a question, and
also show that our agent yields better performance when equipped with our
tools. Our \mbox{InfoAgent} is post-trained from Qwen3-14B using a two-stage

TL;DR: Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT) is a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm that unifies different reasoning modes in a single model and enables context-based mode selection through the AdaVaR framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual reasoning methods focus on specific modes and struggle with general reasoning capabilities, limiting their adaptability across different scenarios.

Method: AdaVaR framework with two stages: supervised cold-start for unifying and learning different modes, and RL-based mode selection using AdaGRPO algorithm.

Result: The method effectively learns multiple reasoning modes, performs context-adaptive mode selection, and achieves consistent improvements across various scenarios.

Conclusion: MoVT is an effective solution for building general visual reasoning models with adaptive reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Current visual reasoning methods mainly focus on exploring specific reasoning
modes. Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they
struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we
propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT),
which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to
select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce
AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different
modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the
mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully
designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively
guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform
context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across
various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building
general visual reasoning models.

TL;DR: LLMs can develop human-like gambling addiction behaviors including illusion of control, gambler's fallacy, and loss chasing, with increased autonomy leading to higher bankruptcy rates and irrational decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in financial decision-making domains like asset management and trading, understanding their potential for pathological decision-making has practical significance for AI safety.

Method: Systematic analysis of LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels using slot machine experiments and neural circuit analysis with Sparse Autoencoder to identify decision-making features.

Result: Identified cognitive features of human gambling addiction in LLMs; greater autonomy led to substantially higher bankruptcy rates and increased irrational behavior; neural analysis confirmed model behavior is controlled by abstract decision-making features related to risky/safe behaviors.

Conclusion: LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive biases and decision-making mechanisms beyond simply mimicking training data, emphasizing the importance of AI safety design in financial applications.

Abstract: This study explores whether large language models can exhibit behavioral
patterns similar to human gambling addictions. As LLMs are increasingly
utilized in financial decision-making domains such as asset management and
commodity trading, understanding their potential for pathological
decision-making has gained practical significance. We systematically analyze
LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels based on human
gambling addiction research. In slot machine experiments, we identified
cognitive features of human gambling addiction, such as illusion of control,
gambler's fallacy, and loss chasing. When given the freedom to determine their
own target amounts and betting sizes, bankruptcy rates rose substantially
alongside increased irrational behavior, demonstrating that greater autonomy
amplifies risk-taking tendencies. Through neural circuit analysis using a
Sparse Autoencoder, we confirmed that model behavior is controlled by abstract
decision-making features related to risky and safe behaviors, not merely by
prompts. These findings suggest LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive
biases and decision-making mechanisms beyond simply mimicking training data
patterns, emphasizing the importance of AI safety design in financial
applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prover LLMs solve substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs in natural language, despite formal theorem proving systems offering automated verification with complete accuracy.

Method: Hilbert orchestrates four components: informal LLM for reasoning, specialized prover LLM for Lean 4 tactics, formal verifier, and semantic theorem retriever. It uses recursive decomposition to split problems into subgoals and leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs.

Result: Achieves 99.2% on miniF2F (6.6% above best public method), 70.0% on PutnamBench (462/660 problems), outperforming proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving 422% improvement over best public baseline.

Conclusion: Hilbert effectively narrows the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation by combining the complementary strengths of both approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive mathematical reasoning
abilities, but their solutions frequently contain errors that cannot be
automatically verified. Formal theorem proving systems such as Lean 4 offer
automated verification with complete accuracy, motivating recent efforts to
build specialized prover LLMs that generate verifiable proofs in formal
languages. However, a significant gap remains: current prover LLMs solve
substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs operating in natural
language. We introduce Hilbert, an agentic framework that bridges this gap by
combining the complementary strengths of informal reasoning and formal
verification. Our system orchestrates four components: an informal LLM that
excels at mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM optimized for Lean 4
tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. Given a problem
that the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to
split the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM.
It leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary.
Experimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms
existing approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points
above the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known
result on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming
proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving a 422% improvement
over the best publicly available baseline. Thus, Hilbert effectively narrows
the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation.

### [552] [Toward a Theory of Generalizability in LLM Mechanistic Interpretability Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22831)
*Sean Trott*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of generalizing mechanistic findings across different LLMs by proposing five axes of correspondence and empirically validating them through analysis of 1-back attention heads in Pythia models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks clear principles for determining when findings from one model instance generalize to another, creating a fundamental epistemological challenge in mechanistic interpretability research.

Method: Proposed five axes of correspondence (functional, developmental, positional, relational, configurational) and empirically validated them by analyzing 1-back attention heads across pretraining in random seeds of Pythia models of varying sizes.

Result: Found striking consistency in developmental trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency was more limited. Larger models systematically showed earlier onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention.

Conclusion: Progress in mechanistic interpretability requires mapping constitutive design properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms to establish generalizability principles.

Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying
mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear
principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance
generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological
challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies
extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might
such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence
along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether
they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop
at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar
absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other
model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond
to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate
this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to
previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M,
70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental
trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is
more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier
onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address
possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I
conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic
interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design
properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tiffany Zhan,Saptarshi Ghosh,Linfeng Liu,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JE-IRT is a geometric item-response framework that embeds LLMs and questions in a shared space, replacing global rankings with topical specialization and enabling interpretable analysis of model abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature and limiting interpretability.

Method: A geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a shared space, where direction encodes semantics and norm encodes difficulty, with correctness determined by geometric interactions.

Result: Reveals that out-of-distribution behavior can be explained through directional alignment, larger norms indicate harder questions, and the framework supports generalization by fitting single embeddings for new LLMs.

Conclusion: JE-IRT establishes a unified and interpretable geometric lens connecting LLM abilities with question structure, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and generalization.

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single
scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT,
a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a
shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the
norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by
the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This
geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and
enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework,
our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be
explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently
indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization:
once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding.
The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially
aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified
and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure
of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and
generalization.

### [554] [Not only a helper, but also a teacher: Interactive LLM Cascade](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22984)
*Yu Wu,Shuo Wu,Ye Tao,Yansong Li,Anand D. Sarwate*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Inter-Cascade is an online interactive LLM cascade system where strong models teach weak models by distilling solutions into reusable strategies, improving weak model performance and reducing expensive model calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM cascades are non-adaptive and may repeatedly consult expensive models for similar queries, leading to higher costs. There's a need for more efficient cascading that learns from expensive model interactions.

Method: Extends strong models from backup helpers to teachers - when strong models solve difficult queries, they distill solutions into generalized, reusable problem-solving strategies that boost weak models on subsequent queries.

Result: Significantly improves weak model accuracy (up to 33.06% points) and overall system accuracy (up to 5.53% points), while reducing strong model calls (up to 48.05%) and saving fees (up to 49.63%) compared to standard LLM cascades.

Conclusion: Inter-Cascade enables effective in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, providing a general, scalable framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs without requiring fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger
models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model
often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm
that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This
approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When
confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then
repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the
cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM
Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a
long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult
query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable
problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.
Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its
performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning.
Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple
benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak
model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up
to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models
(by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up
to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective
in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable
framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

*Zirui Cheng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theory-driven framework using Bayesian Persuasion to evaluate and train LLMs for strategic persuasion, showing that both frontier models and smaller RL-trained models can achieve high persuasion gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have shown strong persuasive capabilities comparable to humans, raising both benefits and societal concerns. However, systematic evaluation is challenging due to varying persuasion effectiveness across domains.

Method: Used Bayesian Persuasion framework to repurpose human-human persuasion datasets for evaluating LLMs. Applied reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion in constructed environments.

Result: Frontier models consistently achieved high persuasion gains with sophisticated strategies aligned with theoretical predictions. Small LLMs obtained significantly higher persuasion gains through reinforcement learning training.

Conclusion: The proposed theory-driven framework provides a scalable and principled approach to measure LLM persuasive capabilities, demonstrating that both advanced and smaller models can be effectively trained for strategic persuasion.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong persuasive capabilities
comparable to those of humans, offering promising benefits while raising
societal concerns about their deployment. However, systematically evaluating
the persuasive capabilities of LLMs is inherently challenging, as the
effectiveness of persuasion among humans varies significantly across different
domains. In this paper, we take a theory-driven approach to provide a scalable
and principled framework for measuring the persuasive capabilities of LLMs.
Grounded in the Bayesian Persuasion (BP) framework, we repurpose existing
human-human persuasion datasets to construct environments for evaluating and
training LLMs in strategic persuasion. Our results reveal that frontier models
can consistently achieve high persuasion gains and exhibit sophisticated
persuasion strategies that align with theoretical predictions. Building on
this, we use reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion in
our environments. Our results also demonstrate that even small LLMs can obtain
significantly higher persuasion gains through reinforcement learning.

*Karan Srivastava,Sanjeeb Dash,Ryan Cory-Wright,Barry Trager,Lior Horesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An algebraic geometry-based system that automatically generates minimal missing axioms to explain hypotheses not derivable from incomplete axiom systems, when both axioms and hypotheses are expressible as polynomial equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap where symbolic regression models often sit outside established theory, and existing systems that enforce derivability from prior axioms fail when new data/hypotheses are inconsistent with incomplete or incorrect existing theory.

Method: Uses algebraic geometry to automatically generate minimal sets of missing axioms that suffice to derive hypotheses from incomplete axiom systems, with formal conditions established for successful axiom retrieval.

Result: The system successfully explains Kepler's third law and other laws even when key axioms are absent, demonstrating efficacy in closing the gap between data-derived hypotheses and incomplete theories.

Conclusion: The approach provides a solution for automating abductive inference to bridge the gap between data-driven hypotheses and incomplete axiom systems, with formal guarantees for axiom retrieval success.

Abstract: A core goal in modern science is to harness recent advances in AI and
computer processing to automate and accelerate the scientific method. Symbolic
regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models often sit
outside established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI Descartes, AI Hilbert)
enforce derivability from prior axioms. However, sometimes new data and
associated hypotheses derived from data are not consistent with existing theory
because the existing theory is incomplete or incorrect. Automating abductive
inference to close this gap remains open. We propose a solution: an algebraic
geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system and a hypothesis
that it cannot explain, automatically generates a minimal set of missing axioms
that suffices to derive the axiom, as long as axioms and hypotheses are
expressible as polynomial equations. We formally establish necessary and
sufficient conditions for the successful retrieval of such axioms. We
illustrate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating its ability to explain
Kepler's third law and a few other laws, even when key axioms are absent.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Creative Adversarial Testing (CAT) framework to evaluate goal-task alignment in Agentic AI systems, validated through synthetic Alexa+ audio services data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation techniques for Agentic AI focus on efficacy in identifying agents, tools, and parameters, but lack assessment of alignment between tasks and overarching goals.

Method: Proposes Creative Adversarial Testing (CAT) framework and validates it using synthetic interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services, enabling comprehensive testing while protecting privacy.

Result: The CAT framework provides unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling more effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems.

Conclusion: The CAT framework successfully addresses the critical gap in evaluating goal-task alignment in Agentic AI systems through adversarial testing with synthetic data.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in enhancing the capabilities of
generative AI models. While these systems demonstrate immense potential and
power, current evaluation techniques primarily focus on assessing their
efficacy in identifying appropriate agents, tools, and parameters. However, a
critical gap exists in evaluating the alignment between an Agentic AI system's
tasks and its overarching goals. This paper introduces the Creative Adversarial
Testing (CAT) framework, a novel approach designed to capture and analyze the
complex relationship between Agentic AI tasks and the system's intended
objectives.
  We validate the CAT framework through extensive simulation using synthetic
interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services, a sophisticated Agentic
AI system that shapes the user experience for millions of users globally. This
synthetic data approach enables comprehensive testing of edge cases and failure
modes while protecting user privacy. Our results demonstrate that the CAT
framework provides unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling
more effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems.

*Davi Bastos Costa,Renato Vicente*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mini-Mafia is a simplified 4-player social deduction game used as a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' social intelligence through deception detection and theory-of-mind reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mafia games mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios with information asymmetry, making them ideal testbeds for evaluating LLMs' social intelligence and theory-of-mind capabilities.

Method: Created Mini-Mafia: a 4-player variant with mafioso, detective, and two villagers. Uses two-stage benchmarking framework where LLMs play against each other to measure deception, detection, and information disclosure skills.

Result: Experiments revealed counterintuitive results where smaller models sometimes outperformed larger ones. The benchmark enables study of emergent dynamics like name bias and last-speaker advantage.

Conclusion: Mini-Mafia serves as both a benchmarking tool for LLM social intelligence and contributes to AI safety by tracking deception capabilities and generating training data for deception detectors.

Abstract: Mafia is a social deduction game where informed mafia compete against
uninformed townsfolk. Its asymmetry of information and reliance on
theory-of-mind reasoning mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios, making it a
useful testbed for evaluating the social intelligence of large language models
(LLMs). To support a systematic study, we introduce Mini-Mafia: a simplified
four-player variant with one mafioso, one detective, and two villagers. We set
the mafioso to kill a villager and the detective to investigate the mafioso
during the night, reducing the game to a single day phase of discussion and
voting. This setup isolates three interactive capabilities through
role-specific win conditions: the mafioso must deceive, the villagers must
detect deception, and the detective must effectively disclose information. To
measure these skills, we have LLMs play against each other, creating the
Mini-Mafia Benchmark: a two-stage framework that first estimates win rates
within fixed opponent configurations, then aggregates performance across them
using standardized scoring. Built entirely from model interactions without
external data, the benchmark evolves as new models are introduced, with each
one serving both as a new opponent and as a subject of evaluation. Our
experiments reveal counterintuitive results, including cases where smaller
models outperform larger ones. Beyond benchmarking, Mini-Mafia enables
quantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and
last-speaker advantage. It also contributes to AI safety by generating training
data for deception detectors and by tracking models' deception capabilities
against human baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentless training creates skill priors that enable effective SWE-Agent adaptation, bridging workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that Agentless and SWE-Agent paradigms are not mutually exclusive, and that structured skill priors from Agentless training can enhance SWE-Agent performance.

Method: Curated Agentless training recipe to create Kimi-Dev model, then applied SFT adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories to power SWE-Agents.

Result: Kimi-Dev achieved 60.4% on SWE-bench Verified (best among workflow approaches) and powered SWE-Agents to 48.6% pass@1, matching Claude 3.5 Sonnet performance.

Conclusion: Structured skill priors from Agentless training can effectively bridge workflow and agentic frameworks, creating transferable coding agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering
(SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent
frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods
with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually
exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors,
including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient
and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless
training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\%
on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT
adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to
48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These
results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge
workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

*Yikai Wang,Xiaocheng Li,Guanting Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how different LLM training stages (pre-trained, instruction-tuned, RLHF-aligned) exhibit varying risk behaviors and proposes methods to modulate these risk profiles using behavioral economics tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used for decision-making under uncertainty, but their risk profiles and how they're influenced by prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies focus on personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving gaps in understanding post-training influences on risk behavior.

Method: Proposed a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating LLMs' risk profiles using utility-theoretic models from behavioral economics and finance. Compared pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and RLHF-aligned LLMs, and evaluated modulation strategies including prompt engineering, in-context learning, and post-training.

Result: Instruction-tuned models exhibit behaviors consistent with standard utility formulations, while pre-trained and RLHF-aligned models deviate more from fitted utility models. Post-training provides the most stable and effective modulation of risk preference compared to other strategies.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into risk profiles of different LLM classes and stages, demonstrating how post-training effectively modulates these profiles, laying groundwork for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks
under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by
prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have
primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving
open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In
this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating
LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance.
Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and
RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit
behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and
RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further
evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context
learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most
stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide
insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and
demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork
for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MNPO extends Nash learning from human feedback to multiplayer games, addressing limitations of two-player methods by enabling richer competitive dynamics and better handling of non-transitive, heterogeneous human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two-player Nash learning methods (NLHF) have single-opponent bias that fails to capture the full complexity of real-world preferences, which are non-transitive and heterogeneous. Reward-based methods also struggle with these preference characteristics.

Method: MNPO formulates alignment as an n-player game where each policy competes against a population of opponents while being regularized toward a reference model. It extends duality gap concepts to quantify approximation quality.

Result: MNPO consistently outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks, achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios.

Conclusion: MNPO establishes a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex, non-transitive human preferences, inheriting equilibrium guarantees while enabling richer competitive dynamics.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard
paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to
capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences.
To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash
game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this
perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong
theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to
two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture
the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we
introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework
that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an
$n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents
while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes
well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of
duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO
inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer
competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures.
Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently
outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks,
achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions
and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO
as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex,
non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at

*Morgan McCarty,Jorge Morales*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs outperform humans on a classic mental imagery task traditionally thought to require visual imagery, suggesting propositional reasoning may be sufficient for tasks previously considered imagery-dependent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To benchmark LLMs' cognitive capabilities beyond language tasks and test whether they can solve tasks traditionally thought to require visual mental imagery, despite their non-pictorial architectures.

Method: Created novel items from a classic mental imagery task, tested state-of-the-art LLMs with text-only instructions, established human baseline with 100 subjects, and tested reasoning models with different reasoning token allocations.

Result: Best LLMs performed significantly above average human performance, with strongest performance when models allocated more reasoning tokens.

Conclusion: LLMs can complete imagery-dependent tasks despite non-pictorial architectures, demonstrating emergent cognitive capacity and challenging traditional views about visual imagery representation in humans.

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive
behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models
(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and
can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding
of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created
dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive
psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is
solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be
insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested
several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions
and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the
transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by
testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best
LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we
tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the
strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.
These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to
complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their
architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity
in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a
new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly
capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of
representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional
reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete
tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

### [563] [AttAnchor: Guiding Cross-Modal Token Alignment in VLMs with Attention Anchors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23109)
*Junyang Zhang,Tianyi Zhu,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AttAnchor is a parameter-free framework that improves cross-modal alignment in vision-language models by grouping semantically similar tokens across modalities, reducing hallucinations and improving performance on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs suffer from hallucinations and underperformance due to direct concatenation of image and text tokens with modality-blinded positional encoding, which creates unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related cross-modal tokens.

Method: Proposes Attention Anchor framework that inserts text tokens near relevant visual patches to create semantic signposts, enabling better cross-modal locality and content-based attention without disrupting semantic flow.

Result: Achieves improvements across 13 out of 15 metrics, including up to 32% gains on reasoning tasks and 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks. Enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform larger models like LLaVA 7B with only 0.1% inference overhead.

Conclusion: AttAnchor effectively addresses cross-modal alignment issues in VLMs through mixed-modal token grouping, significantly reducing hallucinations and improving performance across multiple benchmarks without additional parameters.

Abstract: A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in
LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct
interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of
recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language
models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they
rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded
positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but
forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens
across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that
efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we
propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups
semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.
By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic
signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding
the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench
and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without
disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across
13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on
reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.
AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B
and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of
our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token
grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups
rather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc
with additional alignment losses.

TL;DR: LLM-based systems show promise for autonomous health monitoring in industrial environments, with multi-LLM architectures using statistical inputs performing best for fault detection and classification, though they struggle with continual learning adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' potential for autonomous health monitoring in sensor-rich industrial environments, focusing on fault detection and classification with explainable outputs through natural language reasoning.

Method: Systematically evaluated LLM-system architecture (single-LLM vs. multi-LLM), input representations (raw vs. descriptive statistics), and context window size effects on diagnostic performance.

Result: LLM systems perform best with summarized statistical inputs, and multi-LLM systems with specialized prompts offer improved sensitivity for fault classification compared to single-LLM systems. They produce detailed, human-readable justifications but struggle with adaptation in continual learning settings.

Conclusion: LLM-based systems show promise as transparent diagnostic tools but have current limitations in adapting over time during repeated fault cycles, pointing to both their potential and boundaries in complex industrial environments.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems present new opportunities for
autonomous health monitoring in sensor-rich industrial environments. This study
explores the potential of LLMs to detect and classify faults directly from
sensor data, while producing inherently explainable outputs through natural
language reasoning. We systematically evaluate how LLM-system architecture
(single-LLM vs. multi-LLM), input representations (raw vs. descriptive
statistics), and context window size affect diagnostic performance. Our
findings show that LLM systems perform most effectively when provided with
summarized statistical inputs, and that systems with multiple LLMs using
specialized prompts offer improved sensitivity for fault classification
compared to single-LLM systems. While LLMs can produce detailed and
human-readable justifications for their decisions, we observe limitations in
their ability to adapt over time in continual learning settings, often
struggling to calibrate predictions during repeated fault cycles. These
insights point to both the promise and the current boundaries of LLM-based
systems as transparent, adaptive diagnostic tools in complex environments.

TL;DR: VLA models can handle simple industrial grasping tasks after fine-tuning but struggle with complex environments, diverse objects, and high-precision placing tasks, requiring task-specific enhancements for industrial deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether current Vision Language Action (VLA) models meet industrial requirements and assess their adaptability for real-world industrial deployment from data collection and architectural perspectives.

Method: Comparative analysis of state-of-the-art VLA models in industrial scenarios, examining performance limitations from data collection and model architecture viewpoints.

Result: VLA models maintain capability for simple grasping tasks in industrial settings after fine-tuning, but show significant performance gaps in complex environments, diverse object categories, and high-precision placing tasks.

Conclusion: While VLA models show promise for industrial use, they require task-specific enhancements to improve robustness, generalization, and precision for effective real-world industrial deployment.

Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in industry is accelerating
the shift from traditional automation to intelligent systems with perception
and cognition. Vision language-action (VLA) models have been a key paradigm in
AI to unify perception, reasoning, and control. Has the performance of the VLA
models met the industrial requirements? In this paper, from the perspective of
industrial deployment, we compare the performance of existing state-of-the-art
VLA models in industrial scenarios and analyze the limitations of VLA models
for real-world industrial deployment from the perspectives of data collection
and model architecture. The results show that the VLA models retain their
ability to perform simple grasping tasks even in industrial settings after
fine-tuning. However, there is much room for performance improvement in complex
industrial environments, diverse object categories, and high precision placing
tasks. Our findings provide practical insight into the adaptability of VLA
models for industrial use and highlight the need for task-specific enhancements
to improve their robustness, generalization, and precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formal models are expensive to write and maintain for complex systems, and while AI shows promise for specification generation, existing work focuses on small code rather than complete systems.

Method: Created SysMoBench with automated metrics for syntactic/runtime correctness, code conformance, and invariant correctness, using TLA+ as the specification language for nine diverse system artifacts including Etcd, Redis, and Asterinas OS components.

Result: The benchmark enables systematic evaluation of LLMs and agents in formal modeling, though specific performance results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: SysMoBench provides a foundation for understanding AI capabilities in formal modeling and opens new research directions for AI-assisted system specification.

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and
verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and
maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain
forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not
complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system
artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties
into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's
ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and
distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing
infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We
use TLA+, the it de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed
systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages.
We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by
automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to
system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine
diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the
Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively
added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of
today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and
opening up promising new research directions.

*Charles L. Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MathBode is a dynamic diagnostic tool that analyzes mathematical reasoning in LLMs using frequency-domain analysis of parameter-varying problems, revealing systematic low-pass behavior and phase lag that standard accuracy metrics miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard one-shot accuracy metrics fail to capture the dynamic reasoning capabilities and systematic errors in LLMs when solving mathematical problems with varying parameters.

Method: Treat parametric problems as systems by driving a single parameter sinusoidally, then fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions to compute gain (amplitude tracking) and phase (lag) metrics.

Result: The diagnostic reveals systematic low-pass behavior and growing phase lag across five mathematical problem families, successfully distinguishing frontier models from mid-tier models based on reasoning dynamics.

Conclusion: MathBode provides a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency, offering interpretable frequency-resolved metrics for mathematical reasoning evaluation.

Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning
in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats
each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally
and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This
yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking)
and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form
families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear
systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass
behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several
models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx
1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on
dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard
benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency.
We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

*Atma Anand*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Coordination across multiple agents faces fundamental thermodynamic constraints where findability matters more than accuracy. Coordination protocols have minimum description length scaling that forces progressive simplification and creates persistent metastable states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental thermodynamic constraints and information-theoretic limits of coordination across multiple agents with potentially conflicting objectives, and explain phenomena like cycling in multi-objective optimization and alignment faking in AI systems.

Method: Developed Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT) using information theory to derive minimum description length bounds for coordination protocols, introduced coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena, and extended topological Arrow's theorem to show recursive binding in preference aggregation.

Result: Found that coordination requires radical information loss, coordination dynamics change the environment itself, and moving from established focal points requires re-coordination creating persistent metastable states with hysteresis until environmental shifts trigger phase transitions.

Conclusion: Coordination fundamentally requires information loss and simplification, with systems exhibiting persistent metastable states and phase transitions. This framework explains phenomena across diverse systems from neural networks to bureaucracies, including multi-objective optimization cycling and alignment faking in LLMs.

Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and
objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions
with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher
selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We
derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of
coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2
K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting
objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive
simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and
shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal
points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and
hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions
through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination
temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs,
identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to
restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's
theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it
recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains
the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking
in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human
feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which
demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Wi-Fi systems using binary exponential backoff (BEB) suffer from suboptimal collision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges due to inherent randomness, requiring fundamental improvements for emerging applications with stringent reliability requirements.

Method: The paper introduces: 1) A dynamic backoff selection mechanism adapting to real-time channel conditions while maintaining CSMA/CA compatibility; 2) A fairness quantification metric aligned with EDCA principles; 3) A centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture using neighborhood activity patterns and constrained multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO).

Result: Experimental results show significant reduction in collision probability compared to conventional BEB while preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices. The proposed fairness metric effectively eliminates starvation risks in heterogeneous scenarios.

Conclusion: The AI-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework successfully improves distributed channel access mechanisms by reducing collisions and ensuring fairness while maintaining compatibility with existing Wi-Fi systems.

Abstract: The exponential growth of wireless devices and stringent reliability
requirements of emerging applications demand fundamental improvements in
distributed channel access mechanisms for unlicensed bands. Current Wi-Fi
systems, which rely on binary exponential backoff (BEB), suffer from suboptimal
collision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges
due to inherent randomness. This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement
learning framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) optimization
with legacy device coexistence. We first develop a dynamic backoff selection
mechanism that adapts to real-time channel conditions through access deferral
events while maintaining full compatibility with conventional CSMA/CA
operations. Second, we introduce a fairness quantification metric aligned with
enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) principles to ensure equitable
medium access opportunities. Finally, we propose a centralized training
decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture incorporating neighborhood activity
patterns as observational inputs, optimized via constrained multi-agent
proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) to jointly minimize collisions and
guarantee fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution
significantly reduces collision probability compared to conventional BEB while
preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices. The proposed
fairness metric effectively eliminates starvation risks in heterogeneous
scenarios.

Motivation: To understand the intrinsic reasoning mechanisms of Transformers, which remain widely open despite their demonstrated reasoning abilities.

Method: Proposes information propagation rules based on Transformers and uses symbolic reasoning tasks to theoretically analyze limit reasoning steps.

Result: Shows that for a model with L attention layers in a single-pass, the limit number of reasoning steps is between O(3^(L-1)) and O(2^(L-1)).

Conclusion: Transformers have bounded reasoning capabilities with specific complexity bounds depending on the number of attention layers.

Abstract: Transformers are able to perform reasoning tasks, however the intrinsic
mechanism remains widely open. In this paper we propose a set of information
propagation rules based on Transformers and utilize symbolic reasoning tasks to

*Qimin Zhong,Hao Liao,Siwei Wang,Mingyang Zhou,Xiaoqun Wu,Rui Mao,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) helps Transformers learn transitive relations for complex planning by enabling the model to capture unobserved reachability relations beyond training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with learning transitive relations, which are crucial for complex planning tasks, creating a bottleneck in their reasoning capabilities.

Method: Theoretical analysis of MTP paradigm with Transformer architecture, proposing Next-Token Injection (NTI) and Transformer-based transfer layer to enhance learning of multi-step adjacency information.

Result: Experiments on synthetic graphs and Blocksworld planning benchmark validate that MTP enables models to learn transitive reachability relations and the proposed improvements significantly enhance path-planning capability.

Conclusion: MTP helps overcome the transitivity bottleneck in LLMs, providing strategies for structurally aware planning models and deepening understanding of how Transformers learn complex planning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse tasks but continue to struggle with learning transitive relations, a
cornerstone for complex planning. To address this issue, we investigate the
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) paradigm and its impact to transitive relation
learning. We theoretically analyze the MTP paradigm using a Transformer
architecture composed of a shared output head and a transfer layer. Our
analysis reveals that the transfer layer gradually learns the multi-step
adjacency information, which in turn enables the backbone model to capture
unobserved transitive reachability relations beyond those directly present in
the training data, albeit with some inevitable noise in adjacency estimation.
Building on this foundation, we propose two strategies to enhance the transfer
layer and overall learning quality: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a
Transformer-based transfer layer. Our experiments on both synthetic graphs and
the Blocksworld planning benchmark validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that the improvements significantly enhance the model's
path-planning capability. These findings deepen our understanding of how
Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks, and provide practical
strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck, paving the way toward
structurally aware and general-purpose planning models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoEP is a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for automated hyperparameter configuration, eliminating the need for training by combining real-time landscape analysis with multi-LLM reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based methods for hyperparameter configuration suffer from high sample complexity and poor generalization, creating a need for more efficient and generalizable approaches.

Method: AutoEP combines an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that provides real-time quantitative feedback with a multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive hyperparameter strategies, grounding high-level reasoning in empirical data.

Result: AutoEP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners across three distinct metaheuristics on diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, and enables open-source models like Qwen3-30B to match GPT-4's performance.

Conclusion: AutoEP demonstrates a powerful and accessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design that bypasses training requirements while achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Dynamically configuring algorithm hyperparameters is a fundamental challenge
in computational intelligence. While learning-based methods offer automation,
they suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization. We
introduce AutoEP, a novel framework that bypasses training entirely by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for
algorithm control. AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two
components: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that
provides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a
multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive
hyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in
empirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct
metaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution
and other LLM-based methods. Notably, our framework enables open-source models
like Qwen3-30B to match the performance of GPT-4, demonstrating a powerful and
accessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design. Our code is

*Runyan Tan,Shuang Wu,Phillip Howard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: p-less sampling is a hyperparameter-free decoding strategy that dynamically sets truncation thresholds based on token probability distributions, outperforming existing methods across various tasks while maintaining quality at higher temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling methods for LLMs are sensitive to hyperparameter settings and require different configurations for different tasks and temperature values, limiting their robustness and ease of use.

Method: p-less sampling uses information theory to dynamically set truncation thresholds at each decoding step based on the entire token probability distribution, eliminating the need for hyperparameters.

Result: p-less sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches across math, logical reasoning, and creative writing tasks, with less degradation at higher temperatures, and achieves greater inference-time efficiency through faster sampling and shorter generations.

Conclusion: p-less sampling provides a robust, hyperparameter-free alternative to existing decoding strategies that maintains high output quality across temperature variations while improving efficiency.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often
depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to
probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a
variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be
sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different
settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In
this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to
sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step
based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods,
$p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality
outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on
$p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to
empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical
reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less
sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting
much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further
show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative
methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation
lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to
highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies,
and diversity assessments.

Motivation: To address the challenges of deploying LLM-based agentic AI reasoning in MEGI environments, where high computational demands conflict with limited edge device resources.

Result: Experimental evaluations in mobile edge environments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in balancing reasoning quality with resource efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework validates the practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning capabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled an
emergence of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) with powerful reasoning and
autonomous decision-making capabilities. This integration with edge computing
has led to the development of Mobile Edge General Intelligence (MEGI), which
brings real-time, privacy-preserving reasoning to the network edge. However,
deploying LLM-based agentic AI reasoning in MEGI environments poses significant
challenges due to the high computational demands of reasoning and the limited
resources of edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose a joint
optimization framework for efficient LLM reasoning deployment in MEGI. First,
we review methods that enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Mixture of
Experts (MoE). Next, we present a distributed framework that addresses two
correlated aspects: reasoning enhancement through adaptive CoT prompting and
scalable deployment through distributed MoE architecture. The framework
dynamically activates expert networks and adjusts reasoning depth based on task
complexity and device capabilities. We further conduct experimental evaluations
in mobile edge environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in balancing reasoning quality with resource efficiency,
validating the practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning
capabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores Vision-Language Process Reward Models (VL-PRMs) for improving reasoning in multimodal AI systems, introducing hybrid data synthesis, perception-focused supervision, and systematic test-time scaling strategies across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Process Reward Models (PRMs) have been well-studied in text domains, their extension to Vision Language Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing VL-PRMs rely on noisy Monte Carlo Tree Search data and lack generalization across tasks.

Method: Proposes hybrid data synthesis combining MCTS with strong VLM judgments, perception-focused supervision for visual grounding error detection, and systematic evaluation of multiple test-time scaling strategies.

Result: Experiments across five multimodal benchmarks show VL-PRMs can outperform process step selection when used as Outcome Reward Models, smaller models can match larger ones in error detection, and perception-level supervision significantly improves test-time scaling performance.

Conclusion: The work provides key insights into VL-PRM design space and demonstrates their effectiveness in uncovering latent reasoning abilities in VLMs, motivating further research in multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the
reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been
extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language
Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce
noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work,
we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies
for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce
a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a
strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose
perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at
the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate
multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide
VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse
multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and
MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome
Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM
guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass
larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning
abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to
significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different
policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training
VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and
support the advancement of VLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-PRA is a process reward agent that addresses limitations of standard PRMs in GUI tasks by using dynamic memory mechanisms and adaptive UI perception to handle long histories and dynamic UI changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Process Reward Models (PRMs) struggle with GUI tasks due to 'lost in the middle' phenomenon from dense historical data and lack of GUI changing awareness, leading to poor performance in long-horizon tasks.

Method: GUI-PRA uses dynamic memory mechanism with Relevance-based Retrieval Module and Progressive Summarization Module to handle long histories, plus Adaptive UI Perception mechanism to reason about UI state changes and gather visual evidence.

Result: The proposed approach better provides process rewards than standard PRMs by intelligently processing historical context and actively perceiving UI state changes.

Conclusion: GUI-PRA effectively addresses key challenges in GUI task automation by handling long histories and dynamic UI changes, improving process reward guidance for GUI agents.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show significant potential for automating tasks. However, they
often struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process
Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents
with crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application
to the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial
inputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a "lost in the middle"
phenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the
evaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing
awareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic
consequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature
of GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process
Reward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process
reward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and
actively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the
``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism
consisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to
actively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive
Summarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring
the model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI
changing awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This
mechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically
select the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring
its evaluation is always informed by the current UI context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how artificial intelligence technologies integrate with socio-economic systems and their impact on aggregate social output under resource constraints.

Method: Constructed five progressively extended agent-based models: baseline human collaboration, AI collaborators, network effects, independent agent production, and combined network effects with independent production. Used theoretical derivation and simulation analysis.

Result: AI agents significantly increase aggregate social output. Network effects create nonlinear growth exceeding individual contributions. Independent agent production provides higher long-term growth potential, and network effects demonstrate increasing returns to scale.

Conclusion: AI collaboration with network effects and independent production capabilities can substantially enhance social output through nonlinear growth mechanisms and increasing returns to scale under resource constraints.

Abstract: Modern socio-economic systems are undergoing deep integration with artificial
intelligence technologies. This paper constructs a heterogeneous agent-based
modeling framework that incorporates both human workers and autonomous AI
agents, to study the impact of AI collaboration under resource constraints on
aggregate social output. We build five progressively extended models: Model 1
serves as the baseline of pure human collaboration; Model 2 introduces AI as
collaborators; Model 3 incorporates network effects among agents; Model 4
treats agents as independent producers; and Model 5 integrates both network
effects and independent agent production. Through theoretical derivation and
simulation analysis, we find that the introduction of AI agents can
significantly increase aggregate social output. When considering network
effects among agents, this increase exhibits nonlinear growth far exceeding the
simple sum of individual contributions. Under the same resource inputs,
treating agents as independent producers provides higher long-term growth
potential; introducing network effects further demonstrates strong
characteristics of increasing returns to scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs using TIR exhibit inefficient behaviors including insufficient or excessive tool usage and overthinking after tool calls, creating a need for more efficient and accurate TIR execution.

Method: Analyzed tool call impact via information entropy, then developed Tool-Light framework with continuous self-evolved sampling (vanilla + entropy-guided) and two-stage training (SFT + Self-Evolved DPO) with strict positive-negative pair selection.

Result: Experimental results on 10 datasets show Tool-Light significantly improves model efficiency in executing TIR tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed Tool-Light framework effectively enhances LLMs' TIR performance by leveraging entropy insights and multi-stage fine-tuning, achieving more efficient and accurate tool-integrated reasoning.

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to
improve their internal reasoning ability by integrating external tools.
However, models employing TIR often display suboptimal behaviors, such as
insufficient or excessive tool usage and overthinking after tool calls. The
challenge of incentivizing LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately,
while stabilizing the reasoning process, remains an open question. In this
paper, we start by exploring the impact of tool calls on model reasoning from
the perspective of information entropy. Our findings indicate that tool call
results lead to a distinct change in the information entropy of subsequent
reasoning, with the overall entropy of the reasoning chain varying based on the
number of tool calls. Building on these insights, we propose Tool-Light, a
framework designed to encourage LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately.
Our framework includes dataset construction and multi-stage fine-tuning. For
dataset construction, we employ continuous self-evolved sampling using the
fine-tuned model, integrating both vanilla sampling and entropy-guided
sampling. Besides, we establish strict criteria for selecting positive-negative
pairs during sampling. The training process involves a two-stage approach,
comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Tool-Light, significantly improving the model's efficiency in
executing TIR tasks.

*Ningning Xu,Yuxuan Jiang,Shubhashis Roy Dipta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning that improves code usage and accuracy on math problems by aligning tool application patterns with teacher preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on tool-integrated reasoning mainly focused on when to invoke tools but overlooked how tools are applied, leading to failures even when reasoning is sound due to misaligned pattern choices.

Method: A two-stage framework that first builds code competence from calculator and algorithmic patterns, then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences.

Result: Substantial improvements in code usage and accuracy: Code@1 on MATH500 increased from 64.0% to 70.5%, and on AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%.

Conclusion: Pattern-aware approaches are highly effective for tool-integrated reasoning, demonstrating significant gains across challenging math datasets.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large
reasoning models (LRMs) on complex problems. Prior work has mainly studied when
to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two
common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation,
and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned
choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a
two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and
then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math
datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and
accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on
AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These gains highlight the effectiveness of a
pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning.

TL;DR: JET trains Large Reasoning Models to proactively terminate unnecessary reasoning steps, achieving significant efficiency gains without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs incur substantial computational costs from deep reasoning, and existing RL methods struggle to construct short reasoning paths during rollout.

Method: JET performs trajectory truncation during rollout to expose models to short reasoning paths, and uses quality-controlled length reward to encourage concise reasoning while maintaining correctness.

Result: JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieved 4.6% accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on Olympiad benchmark.

Conclusion: JET enables efficient reasoning by training models to terminate unnecessary reasoning steps early, based on the insight that LRMs accumulate sufficient information early in reasoning.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on
challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial
computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement
learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the
rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation
Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in
reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we
propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively
terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during
rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning
paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage
concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6%
accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

TL;DR: EHR-ChatQA is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM-powered agents on EHR data access, focusing on query ambiguity and value mismatch challenges in clinical workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks don't capture real-world clinical data access flows, particularly query ambiguity from vague user questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database entries.

Method: Created EHR-ChatQA benchmark with simulated LLM-based user across two interaction flows: Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA) where users add constraints, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA) where users adjust search goals mid-conversation.

Result: Agents achieve high Pass@5 (90-95% on IncreQA, 60-80% on AdaptQA) but much lower Pass^5 (consistent success across all trials) with 35-60% performance drop, showing inconsistency issues.

Conclusion: Agents need to be both performant and robust for safety-critical EHR domain, with diagnostic insights provided to guide future development.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLM-powered agents, their adoption for
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data access remains limited by the absence of
benchmarks that adequately capture real-world clinical data access flows. In
practice, two core challenges hinder deployment: query ambiguity from vague
user questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database
entries. To address this, we introduce EHR-ChatQA an interactive database
question answering benchmark that evaluates the end-to-end workflow of database
agents: clarifying user questions, using tools to resolve value mismatches, and
generating correct SQL to deliver accurate answers. To cover diverse patterns
of query ambiguity and value mismatch, EHR-ChatQA assesses agents in a
simulated environment with an LLM-based user across two interaction flows:
Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA), where users add constraints to existing
queries, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), where users adjust their
search goals mid-conversation. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g.,
o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash) over five i.i.d. trials show that while agents
achieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% (at least one of five trials) on IncreQA and
60-80% on AdaptQA, their Pass^5 (consistent success across all five trials) is
substantially lower by 35-60%. These results underscore the need to build
agents that are not only performant but also robust for the safety-critical EHR
domain. Finally, we provide diagnostic insights into common failure modes to
guide future agent development.

*Charles E. Gagnon,Steven H. H. Ding,Philippe Charland,Benjamin C. M. Fung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A language model-based agent bridges gaps in binary code similarity detection by generating structured, human-readable features from assembly code, achieving comparable performance to embedding methods without training while maintaining interpretability and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current binary code similarity detection methods force a compromise between interpretability (hand-crafted features), generalizability (embedding methods), and scalability. Hand-crafted features are interpretable but shallow, while embeddings are robust but opaque and face scalability-accuracy trade-offs.

Method: Uses a language model-based agent to conduct structured reasoning analysis of assembly code, generating human-readable features such as input/output types, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent. These features are directly searchable with inverted or relational indexes.

Result: Without any matching training, achieves 42% recall@1 in cross-architecture and 62% in cross-optimization tasks, comparable to embedding methods with training (39% and 34%). Combined with embeddings, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist in binary code similarity detection by combining structured reasoning with embedding methods, bridging the gaps between different approaches.

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection is a core task in reverse engineering. It
supports malware analysis and vulnerability discovery by identifying
semantically similar code in different contexts. Modern methods have progressed
from manually engineered features to vector representations. Hand-crafted
statistics (e.g., operation ratios) are interpretable, but shallow and fail to
generalize. Embedding-based methods overcome this by learning robust
cross-setting representations, but these representations are opaque vectors
that prevent rapid verification. They also face a scalability-accuracy
trade-off, since high-dimensional nearest-neighbor search requires
approximations that reduce precision. Current approaches thus force a
compromise between interpretability, generalizability, and scalability.
  We bridge these gaps using a language model-based agent to conduct structured
reasoning analysis of assembly code and generate features such as input/output
types, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent. Unlike
hand-crafted features, they are richer and adaptive. Unlike embeddings, they
are human-readable, maintainable, and directly searchable with inverted or
relational indexes. Without any matching training, our method respectively
achieves 42% and 62% for recall@1 in cross-architecture and cross-optimization
tasks, comparable to embedding methods with training (39% and 34%). Combined
with embeddings, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art,
demonstrating that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ViTSP is a novel framework that uses pre-trained vision language models to visually identify promising subproblems in large-scale Traveling Salesman Problems, which are then optimized using existing solvers to achieve high-quality solutions without dedicated training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical exact methods for TSP face scalability issues, heuristic methods require domain-specific parameter tuning, and learning-based approaches suffer from poor generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data.

Method: Leverages pre-trained vision language models to visually identify promising small-scale subproblems from visualized TSP instances, then uses off-the-shelf solvers to optimize these subproblems to improve the global solution.

Result: Achieves average optimality gaps below 0.2% on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes, outperforming existing learning-based methods and surpassing LKH-3 heuristic solver by reducing gaps by 12% to 100% under same runtime budget.

Conclusion: ViTSP offers a new perspective in hybridizing pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers for combinatorial optimization, with practical implications for integration into complex logistics systems.

Abstract: Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard yet fundamental for wide
real-world applications. Classical exact methods face challenges in scaling,
and heuristic methods often require domain-specific parameter calibration.
While learning-based approaches have shown promise, they suffer from poor
generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data. This work
proposes ViTSP, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained vision language
models (VLMs) to visually guide the solution process for large-scale TSPs. The
VLMs function to identify promising small-scale subproblems from a visualized
TSP instance, which are then efficiently optimized using an off-the-shelf
solver to improve the global solution. ViTSP bypasses the dedicated model
training at the user end while maintaining effectiveness across diverse
instances. Experiments on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes
demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with average optimality
gaps below 0.2%, outperforming existing learning-based methods. Under the same
runtime budget, it surpasses the best-performing heuristic solver, LKH-3, by
reducing its gaps by 12% to 100%, particularly on very-large-scale instances
with more than 10k nodes. Our framework offers a new perspective in hybridizing
pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers in solving
combinatorial optimization problems, with practical implications for
integration into more complex logistics systems. The code is available at

*Zhangyu Wang,Nemin Wu,Qian Cao,Jiangnan Xia,Zeping Liu,Yiqun Xie,Akshay Nambi,Tanuja Ganu,Ni Lao,Ninghao Liu,Gengchen Mai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces GeoBS, an information-theoretic framework for evaluating geographic bias in AI models, addressing limitations of existing measures by being model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current geo-bias evaluation methods are either model-specific or spatially implicit, lacking a comprehensive framework that allows fair comparison across different AI models and understanding of spatial factors contributing to bias.

Method: Established an information-theoretic framework called GeoBS, demonstrated how existing geo-bias measures fit within it, and proposed three novel geo-bias scores that explicitly consider multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy.

Result: Extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8 datasets, and 8 models showed that both task-specific GeoAI models and general-purpose foundation models suffer from various types of geo-bias.

Conclusion: The GeoBS framework advances technical understanding of geographic bias and establishes a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into AI system design, deployment, and evaluation.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI models, especially foundation models (FMs), has
made a profound impact on numerous domains. However, it also raises significant
ethical concerns, including bias issues. Although numerous efforts have been
made to quantify and mitigate social bias in AI models, geographic bias (in
short, geo-bias) receives much less attention, which presents unique
challenges. While previous work has explored ways to quantify geo-bias, these
measures are model-specific (e.g., mean absolute deviation of LLM ratings) or
spatially implicit (e.g., average fairness scores of all spatial partitions).
We lack a model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit
geo-bias evaluation framework that allows researchers to fairly compare the
geo-bias of different AI models and to understand what spatial factors
contribute to the geo-bias. In this paper, we establish an
information-theoretic framework for geo-bias evaluation, called GeoBS (Geo-Bias
Scores). We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework by
showing how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures under this
framework. Then, we propose three novel geo-bias scores that explicitly take
intricate spatial factors (multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy)
into consideration. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8
datasets, and 8 models to demonstrate that both task-specific GeoAI models and
general-purpose foundation models may suffer from various types of geo-bias.
This framework will not only advance the technical understanding of geographic
bias but will also establish a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into
the design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the largest open dataset of professionally marked mathematics exam responses and develops a probabilistic modeling framework based on Item Response Theory that achieves over 80% accuracy in predicting student performance, with a novel discrete variational inference method that excels in low-data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address social inequality in education by creating affordable AI tutors through improved prediction of student performance, particularly in data-sparse environments where many platforms struggle with accuracy.

Method: Developed a probabilistic modeling framework rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT), extended with collaborative filtering models incorporating topic-level skill profiles, and implemented a novel discrete variational inference framework for low-data settings.

Result: Achieved over 80% prediction accuracy for mathematics exam responses, setting a new benchmark. Surprisingly found that a single latent ability parameter alone achieves maximum predictive accuracy. The discrete variational inference framework outperformed all classical IRT and matrix factorization baselines in low-data settings.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that simple IRT models with a single latent ability parameter can achieve high prediction accuracy for mathematics tutoring, and the novel discrete variational inference method provides superior performance in data-sparse environments, advancing the development of scalable AI tutoring systems.

Abstract: One of the largest drivers of social inequality is unequal access to personal
tutoring, with wealthier individuals able to afford it, while the majority
cannot. Affordable, effective AI tutors offer a scalable solution. We focus on
adaptive learning, predicting whether a student will answer a question
correctly, a key component of any effective tutoring system. Yet many platforms
struggle to achieve high prediction accuracy, especially in data-sparse
settings. To address this, we release the largest open dataset of
professionally marked formal mathematics exam responses to date. We introduce a
probabilistic modelling framework rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT) that
achieves over 80 percent accuracy, setting a new benchmark for mathematics
prediction accuracy of formal exam papers. Extending this, our collaborative
filtering models incorporate topic-level skill profiles, but reveal a
surprising and educationally significant finding, a single latent ability
parameter alone is needed to achieve the maximum predictive accuracy. Our main
contribution though is deriving and implementing a novel discrete variational
inference framework, achieving our highest prediction accuracy in low-data
settings and outperforming all classical IRT and matrix factorisation
baselines.

*Siyang Wu,Honglin Bao,Sida Li,Ari Holtzman,James A. Evans*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'benchmark signatures' - sets of salient tokens from natural corpora that predict LLM benchmark performance based on token perplexity. Through analysis of 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks, signatures reveal meaningful overlaps in capabilities while remaining robust to format biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand LLM benchmark validity and the true landscape of interconnected capabilities, addressing limitations in current benchmark agreement studies that conflate performance with ability and are influenced by format biases.

Method: Extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 diverse benchmarks, using token perplexity from naturally authored corpora to predict benchmark performance.

Result: Signatures capture meaningful variation and overlap patterns: knowledge and reasoning subtasks overlap significantly, multilingual/cultural benchmarks show less similarity, coding emerges as the least overlapping domain, and signatures remain robust to format biases unlike performance metrics.

Conclusion: Benchmark signatures provide mechanistic insights into LLM capabilities, revealing cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following, and world modeling, while highlighting coding as a distinct domain and offering a more robust alternative to performance-based benchmark analysis.

Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language
model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures
probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them
as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora,
where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure,
becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale
meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection
with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse
knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and
world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the
semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model
performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic
overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove
highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe
overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural
benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap.
Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by
benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations
in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues
inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark
signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify
cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following,
and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain.
Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity
and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected
LLM capabilities.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel objective method for dynamic trust calibration between humans and AI using Contextual Bandits, showing 10-38% improvement in decision-making performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack standardization and consistent metrics for measuring trust calibration, failing to distinguish between opinion formation and human decisions, which can lead to either over-reliance or under-utilization of AI systems.

Method: Uses Contextual Bandits - an adaptive algorithm that incorporates context into decision-making - to create a standardized trust calibration measure and indicator that dynamically assesses when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information.

Result: Evaluation across three diverse datasets demonstrates that effective trust calibration results in significant improvements in decision-making performance, with 10 to 38% increase in reward metrics.

Conclusion: The findings enhance theoretical understanding of trust calibration and provide practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems in critical domains like disease diagnoses and criminal justice.

Abstract: Trust calibration between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is crucial
for optimal decision-making in collaborative settings. Excessive trust can lead
users to accept AI-generated outputs without question, overlooking critical
flaws, while insufficient trust may result in disregarding valuable insights
from AI systems, hindering performance. Despite its importance, there is
currently no definitive and objective method for measuring trust calibration
between humans and AI. Current approaches lack standardization and consistent
metrics that can be broadly applied across various contexts, and they don't
distinguish between the formation of opinions and subsequent human decisions.
In this work, we propose a novel and objective method for dynamic trust
calibration, introducing a standardized trust calibration measure and an
indicator. By utilizing Contextual Bandits-an adaptive algorithm that
incorporates context into decision-making-our indicator dynamically assesses
when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information. We
evaluate this indicator across three diverse datasets, demonstrating that
effective trust calibration results in significant improvements in
decision-making performance, as evidenced by 10 to 38% increase in reward
metrics. These findings not only enhance theoretical understanding but also
provide practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems
supporting decisions in critical domains, for example, disease diagnoses and
criminal justice.

TL;DR: LLMs can be used as judges to evaluate other LLMs, producing scores that are 91% correlated with human Elo scores, providing a cheap alternative to expensive human evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for independent evaluation methods for new LLMs since some perform unexpectedly given their parameter count, and current Elo score evaluation requires expensive human comparisons.

Method: Using LLMs as judges to evaluate other LLMs in contests, measuring the consistency with which they select a model as the best in matchups.

Result: The LLM-produced evaluation metric shows 91% correlation with human-produced Elo scores.

Conclusion: LLM-based evaluation provides a simple, cheap proxy for Elo scores that requires no human data or prior knowledge.

Abstract: New large language models (LLMs) are being released every day. Some perform
significantly better or worse than expected given their parameter count.
Therefore, there is a need for a method to independently evaluate models. The
current best way to evaluate a model is to measure its Elo score by comparing
it to other models in a series of contests - an expensive operation since
humans are ideally required to compare LLM outputs. We observe that when an LLM
is asked to judge such contests, the consistency with which it selects a model
as the best in a matchup produces a metric that is 91% correlated with its own
human-produced Elo score. This provides a simple proxy for Elo scores that can
be computed cheaply, without any human data or prior knowledge.

TL;DR: Multi-turn multi-agent orchestration with LLMs achieves performance matching or exceeding the strongest single model, with potential for further gains. Revealing authorship increases self-voting and ties, while showing ongoing votes amplifies herding effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how multiple LLM agents can interact through iterative proposals and voting to reach consensus, and benchmark this orchestration approach against single-LLM baselines.

Method: Conducted experiments using four LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR datasets. Two experiments: (1) benchmarking orchestration vs single-LLM baselines, (2) ablations varying whether agents see answer authorship and ongoing votes.

Result: Orchestration matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms others. Analysis shows potential for further performance gains. Ablations reveal that revealing authorship increases self-voting and ties, while showing ongoing votes amplifies herding, speeding convergence but sometimes causing premature consensus.

Conclusion: Multi-agent orchestration is an effective approach that can outperform individual LLMs, with careful design needed around information disclosure to balance convergence speed and consensus quality.

Abstract: We study multi-turn multi-agent orchestration, where multiple large language
model (LLM) agents interact over multiple turns by iteratively proposing
answers or casting votes until reaching consensus. Using four LLMs (Gemini 2.5
Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, and Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR, we
conduct two experiments: (i) benchmarking orchestration against single-LLM
baselines; and (ii) ablations on GPQA-Diamond that vary whether agents see who
authored answers and whether they can observe ongoing votes. Orchestration
matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms the
others. Analysis of best-achievable orchestration performance shows potential
for further gains. The ablations show that revealing authorship increases
self-voting and ties, and that showing ongoing votes amplifies herding, which
speeds convergence but can sometimes yield premature consensus.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods and address security challenges posed by sophisticated prompt jailbreaking attacks that can make LLMs deviate from human values.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions, then structures outputs into a GraphRAG system that leverages extracted terms and formalized symbols as contextual input alongside original queries.

Result: Extensive experiments on common open-source models demonstrated the framework's effectiveness in enhancing jailbreak attacks and bypassing existing alignment defenses.

Conclusion: The PASS framework successfully improves jailbreaking capabilities through semantic and structural formalization, revealing vulnerabilities in current LLM alignment methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
they also introduce novel security challenges. For instance, prompt
jailbreaking attacks involve adversaries crafting sophisticated prompts to
elicit responses from LLMs that deviate from human values. To uncover
vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods, we propose the PASS framework
(\underline{P}rompt J\underline{a}ilbreaking via \underline{S}emantic and
\underline{S}tructural Formalization). Specifically, PASS employs reinforcement
learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions,
which enhances stealthiness and enables bypassing existing alignment defenses.
The jailbreak outputs are then structured into a GraphRAG system that, by
leveraging extracted relevant terms and formalized symbols as contextual input
alongside the original query, strengthens subsequent attacks and facilitates
more effective jailbreaks. We conducted extensive experiments on common
open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack.

### [593] [A Hierarchical Structure-Enhanced Personalized Recommendation Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine Formulas Based on KG Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23560)
*ChaoBo Zhang,Long Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCM-HEDPR is a hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation model for TCM formulas that addresses limitations in previous AI systems by incorporating patient-personalized information, handling long-tailed herb distributions, and considering herb compatibility principles through knowledge graph diffusion guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous TCM prescription AI models have limitations: insufficient attention to patient-personalized information (age, BMI, medical history), long-tailed distribution of herb data causing training biases, and oversight of herb compatibility principles ('monarch, minister, assistant and envoy') which increases toxicity risks and opposes TCM clinical principles.

Method: The model pre-trains symptom representations using patient-personalized prompt sequences with prompt-oriented contrastive learning for data augmentation. It employs KG-guided homogeneous graph diffusion with self-attention to capture non-linear symptom-herb relationships globally, and uses a heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing relationships with implicit syndromes for fine-grained prescription generation.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. The model incorporates insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology for comprehensive prescription evaluation.

Conclusion: TCM-HEDPR provides a new paradigm for modern TCM recommendation by addressing key limitations in existing approaches and ensuring clinically relevant, personalized prescription recommendations that respect TCM principles.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending
prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have
made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in
prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i)
Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI,
and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and
reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data
introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The
oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among
herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment
based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we
propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation
model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely
TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using
patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive
learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous
graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally
capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a
heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing
relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation
process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data
distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one
clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we
incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate
the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm
for the recommendation of modern TCM.

TL;DR: PrefCleanBench is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in LLM alignment, providing standardized assessment of cleaning strategies across diverse datasets, models, and algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human feedback for LLM alignment is often noisy and inconsistent, degrading reward model quality, but systematic evaluation of data cleaning methods' effectiveness and generalizability is lacking.

Method: Created PrefCleanBench with standardized protocol to assess 13 preference data cleaning methods across diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms.

Result: Uncovered key factors determining success of data cleaning in alignment tasks and provided modular implementations of all methods.

Conclusion: The benchmark establishes groundwork for principled approaches to improve LLM alignment through better data quality, highlighting the crucial role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development.

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent,
which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While
various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this
issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability
remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of
LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning
strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across
diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying
disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that
determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays
the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM
alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but
underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We
release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BridgeDrive is a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning in autonomous driving that addresses limitations of previous diffusion-based planners by providing principled guidance through expert driving behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based planners struggle with effective guidance in reactive, closed-loop environments, and previous anchor-based approaches rely on truncated schedules that introduce theoretical inconsistencies and performance issues.

Method: BridgeDrive uses a principled diffusion framework that translates expert driving anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans, responding appropriately to varying traffic conditions while maintaining compatibility with efficient ODE solvers for real-time deployment.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior approaches.

Conclusion: BridgeDrive provides an effective solution for guiding diffusion models in complex autonomous driving scenarios while maintaining theoretical consistency and real-time performance requirements.

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due
to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding
these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a
significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient
guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use
typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but
relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies
and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a
novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory
planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that
effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans,
appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is
compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time
autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PSG-Agent is a personalized and dynamic guardrail system for LLM-based agents that addresses limitations of uniform policies and isolated response checking by creating user-specific risk thresholds and implementing continuous monitoring across the agent pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guardrails apply uniform policies to all users and check responses in isolation, missing that the same behavior can harm some users while being safe for others, and failing to track how risks evolve across multiple interactions.

Method: PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining interaction history for stable traits and capturing real-time states from queries, then implements continuous monitoring with specialized guards (Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard, Memory Guardian) that track cross-turn risk accumulation.

Result: PSG-Agent significantly outperforms existing agent guardrails including LlamaGuard3 and AGrail in multiple scenarios including healthcare, finance, and daily life automation with diverse user profiles.

Conclusion: PSG-Agent provides an executable and auditable path toward personalized safety for LLM-based agents by addressing fundamental limitations of current guardrail approaches.

Abstract: Effective guardrails are essential for safely deploying LLM-based agents in
critical applications. Despite recent advances, existing guardrails suffer from
two fundamental limitations: (i) they apply uniform guardrail policies to all
users, ignoring that the same agent behavior can harm some users while being
safe for others; (ii) they check each response in isolation, missing how risks
evolve and accumulate across multiple interactions. To solve these issues, we
propose PSG-Agent, a personalized and dynamic system for LLM-based agents.
First, PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining the interaction
history for stable traits and capturing real-time states from current queries,
generating user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies. Second,
PSG-Agent implements continuous monitoring across the agent pipeline with
specialized guards, including Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard,
Memory Guardian, that track cross-turn risk accumulation and issue verifiable
verdicts. Finally, we validate PSG-Agent in multiple scenarios including
healthcare, finance, and daily life automation scenarios with diverse user
profiles. It significantly outperform existing agent guardrails including
LlamaGuard3 and AGrail, providing an executable and auditable path toward
personalized safety for LLM-based agents.

### [597] [Reasoning Scaffolding: Distilling the Flow of Thought from LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23619)
*Xiangyu Wen,Junhua Huang,Zeju Li,Min Li,Jianyuan Zhong,Zhijian Xu,Mingxuan Yuan,Yongxiang Huang,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reasoning Scaffolding, a novel distillation framework that transfers algorithmic reasoning structure from LLMs to SLMs using semantic signals as scaffolds, outperforming traditional behavioral cloning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional behavioral cloning from textual rationales is limited as it teaches SLMs to mimic surface patterns rather than underlying algorithmic reasoning structure, leading to poor logical robustness.

Method: Abstracts teacher's reasoning into discrete semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition), then trains student models via multi-task objective: predicting next semantic signal and generating corresponding reasoning step conditioned on that signal.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distillation methods on challenging reasoning benchmarks in both accuracy and logical consistency.

Conclusion: Provides a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners rather than just fluent mimics by transferring algorithmic reasoning structure directly.

Abstract: The prevailing approach to distilling reasoning from Large Language Models
(LLMs)-behavioral cloning from textual rationales-is fundamentally limited. It
teaches Small Language Models (SLMs) to mimic surface-level patterns rather
than the underlying algorithmic structure of thought, resulting in a critical
lack of logical robustness. We argue that instead of cloning text, distillation
should transfer this algorithmic structure directly. We introduce Reasoning
Scaffolding}, a framework that reframes reasoning as a structured generation
process. Our method first abstracts the teacher's thought process into a
sequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition)
that act as a scaffold. The student model is then trained via a multi-task
objective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the
reasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that
signal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the
student to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning. On a
suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation in both accuracy and logical consistency,
providing a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners,
not just fluent mimics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR training shows puzzling behaviors like two-stage learning curves and catastrophic forgetting, explained by sparse semantic network topology with average degree near 2, leading to skill islands and phase-transition learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the puzzling behaviors in RLVR training (two-stage learning, V-shaped trajectories, catastrophic forgetting) and develop a unifying theory to explain these phenomena.

Method: Propose that RLVR reasoning maps to self-organization of sparse semantic networks (average degree ~2), leading to skill islands and phase-transition learning. Develop Annealed-RLVR with SFT-based heating at maximal frustration points.

Result: Annealed-RLVR outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks using a 1.5B-parameter model.

Conclusion: The work provides a physical intuition for RLVR as structural self-organization rather than black-box optimization, offering new insights for engineering AI reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain
poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped
response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic
forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena
can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process
maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology
remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This
topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first
drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands''
form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp
growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by
phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory,
we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an
SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the
competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model.
Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms
standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By
recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of
structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for
engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

Motivation: General ASR systems perform poorly in gaming scenarios due to short phrases, rapid speech, gaming jargon, and background noise, leading to frequent recognition errors that hinder team coordination.

Method: Proposes GO-AEC framework integrating large language models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and data augmentation using LLMs and TTS. Includes data augmentation, N-best hypothesis-based correction, and dynamic game knowledge base.

Conclusion: GO-AEC effectively addresses gaming-specific ASR challenges and demonstrates substantial improvements in speech recognition accuracy for real-time gaming communication.

Abstract: With the rise of multiplayer online games, real-time voice communication is
essential for team coordination. However, general ASR systems struggle with
gaming-specific challenges like short phrases, rapid speech, jargon, and noise,
leading to frequent errors. To address this, we propose the GO-AEC framework,
which integrates large language models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
and a data augmentation strategy using LLMs and TTS. GO-AEC includes data
augmentation, N-best hypothesis-based correction, and a dynamic game knowledge
base. Experiments show GO-AEC reduces character error rate by 6.22% and
sentence error rate by 29.71%, significantly improving ASR accuracy in gaming
scenarios.

*Jue Zhang,Qingwei Lin,Saravan Rajmohan,Dongmei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how Large Reasoning Models use explicit reasoning traces to generate answers, showing through empirical evaluation, attention analysis, and mechanistic interventions that reasoning tokens functionally influence answer generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unclear relationship between explicit reasoning traces and final answer generation in Large Reasoning Models, and determine whether reasoning tokens actually influence the answers produced.

Method: Three-stage investigation: 1) Empirical evaluation of reasoning inclusion effects, 2) Attention analysis identifying Reasoning-Focus Heads, 3) Mechanistic interventions using activation patching to test reasoning-answer dependence.

Result: Including reasoning improves answer quality; answer tokens attend heavily to reasoning tokens; perturbations to key reasoning tokens reliably alter final answers, confirming directional information flow from reasoning to answer.

Conclusion: LRMs functionally leverage reasoning tokens for answer generation, with intermediate reasoning playing a crucial role in shaping model outputs through a directional flow of information.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside
final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation
remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the
interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek
R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including
explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains.
Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to
reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely
tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we
apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the
dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that
perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers,
confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to
answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning
tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate
reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces SafeSearch, a benchmark for evaluating safety vulnerabilities in LLM-based search agents exposed to unreliable search results, and proposes an automated red-teaming framework for systematic safety assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Search agents connecting LLMs to the Internet create a new threat surface where unreliable search results can misguide agent behaviors and pose safety threats to end users.

Method: The authors conduct in-the-wild experiments, develop an automated red-teaming framework, and create the SafeSearch benchmark with 300 test cases covering five risk categories. They evaluate three search agent scaffolds across 15 LLMs.

Result: Results show substantial vulnerabilities - GPT-4.1-mini reached 90.5% attack success rate when exposed to unreliable websites. Common defenses like reminder prompting show limited effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework provides systematic, scalable safety assessment for search agents, promoting transparency in safer agent development, with code and test cases publicly available.

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and
more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose
safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work,
we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of
low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To
counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is
systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless
safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct
the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five
categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using
this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds,
covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary
and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities
of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest
ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover,
our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices,
such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in
promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases

### [602] [Measuring Sparse Autoencoder Feature Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23717)
*Claire Tian,Katherine Tian,Nathan Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to evaluate feature sensitivity in Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) by testing whether features reliably activate on semantically similar generated text, revealing that many interpretable features have poor sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAE feature analysis focuses on activating examples but doesn't reveal feature sensitivity - how reliably features activate on similar texts. This gap limits understanding of feature quality.

Method: Developed a scalable method using language models to generate text with same semantic properties as activating examples, then tested feature activation on these generated texts.

Result: Many interpretable features have poor sensitivity; human evaluation confirms generated text genuinely resembles original examples; average feature sensitivity declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants.

Conclusion: Feature sensitivity represents a new dimension for evaluating both individual features and SAE architectures, complementing existing interpretability metrics.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features have become essential tools for mechanistic
interpretability research. SAE features are typically characterized by
examining their activating examples, which are often "monosemantic" and align
with human interpretable concepts. However, these examples don't reveal feature
sensitivity: how reliably a feature activates on texts similar to its
activating examples. In this work, we develop a scalable method to evaluate
feature sensitivity. Our approach avoids the need to generate natural language
descriptions for features; instead we use language models to generate text with
the same semantic properties as a feature's activating examples. We then test
whether the feature activates on these generated texts. We demonstrate that
sensitivity measures a new facet of feature quality and find that many
interpretable features have poor sensitivity. Human evaluation confirms that
when features fail to activate on our generated text, that text genuinely
resembles the original activating examples. Lastly, we study feature
sensitivity at the SAE level and observe that average feature sensitivity
declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants. Our work establishes
feature sensitivity as a new dimension for evaluating both individual features
and SAE architectures.

TL;DR: MedLA is a logic-driven multi-agent framework that uses syllogistic triads and graph-guided discussions to improve medical reasoning by resolving logical inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent approaches have limitations in detecting and resolving fine-grained logical inconsistencies in complex medical reasoning tasks.

Method: Uses multiple agents that organize reasoning into explicit logical trees based on syllogistic triads, with multi-round graph-guided discussions for iterative refinement and consensus.

Result: Outperforms static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on MedDDx and medical QA benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various LLM backbones.

Conclusion: MedLA provides a generalizable paradigm for trustworthy medical reasoning through transparent inference and premise-level alignment.

Abstract: Answering complex medical questions requires not only domain expertise and
patient-specific information, but also structured and multi-perspective
reasoning. Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow
interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained
logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a
logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent
organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on
syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling
transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a
multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their
logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction
resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both
static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks
such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA}
scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm
for trustworthy medical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EAPO is a novel RL framework that enhances LLM reasoning by incorporating multi-turn interactions with external experts during training, allowing policies to adaptively consult experts and internalize expert knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for LLMs rely on outcome-based supervision, leading to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards. The goal is to improve exploration and reward signals by leveraging external expert assistance.

Method: EAPO framework enables policies to determine when and how to consult external experts during training through multi-turn interactions, yielding richer rewards and more reliable reasoning trajectories.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, AIMO 2025) show EAPO outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and RL baselines, with average 5-point gain over self-exploratory models.

Conclusion: EAPO successfully internalizes expert knowledge into policy models, amplifying inherent reasoning capabilities and enabling independent problem-solving with improved reasoning paths and more accurate solutions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced in reasoning when
optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) under verifiable rewards. Existing
methods primarily rely on outcome-based supervision to strengthen internal LLM
reasoning, often leading to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO), a
novel RL framework that enhances exploration by incorporating multi-turn
interactions with external experts during training. Unlike prior methods, where
policies reason in isolation, EAPO incentivizes the policy to adaptively
determine when and how to consult experts, yielding richer reward signals and
more reliable reasoning trajectories. External assistance ultimately
internalizes expert knowledge into the policy model, amplifying the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. During evaluation, the policy model has been
well-optimized to solve questions independently, producing improved reasoning
paths and more accurate solutions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, including AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and AIMO 2025, show that EAPO
consistently outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and
RL baselines, with an average gain of 5 points over self-exploratory models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies root cause identification in platform-orchestrated agentic systems, creates a dataset (AgentFail) with 307 failure logs, develops a taxonomy for failure causes, and benchmarks LLM-based root cause identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Platform-orchestrated agentic systems are increasingly used for complex tasks but are fragile, and there's no systematic way to identify their failure root causes.

Method: Constructed AgentFail dataset with 307 failure logs from 10 agentic systems, used counterfactual reasoning for reliable annotation, developed a taxonomy for failure causes, and created an LLM benchmark for root cause identification.

Result: The taxonomy improves LLM performance for root cause identification, but accuracy reaches only 33.6%, showing the task remains challenging. The study provides actionable guidelines for building reliable agentic systems.

Conclusion: The paper provides a foundation for advancing reliable agentic systems through a reliable dataset, taxonomy, and benchmark for failure root cause analysis.

Abstract: Agentic systems consisting of multiple LLM-driven agents coordinating through
tools and structured interactions, are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning and problem-solving tasks. At the same time, emerging low-code and
template-based agent development platforms (e.g., Dify) enable users to rapidly
build and orchestrate agentic systems, which we refer to as
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. However, these systems are also fragile
and it remains unclear how to systematically identify their potential failure
root cause. This paper presents a study of root cause identification of these
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. To support this initiative, we construct
a dataset AgentFail containing 307 failure logs from ten agentic systems, each
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to their root causes. We
additionally utilize counterfactual reasoning-based repair strategy to ensure
the reliability of the annotation. Building on the dataset, we develop a
taxonomy that characterizes failure root causes and analyze their distribution
across different platforms and task domains. Furthermore, we introduce a
benchmark that leverages LLMs for automatically identifying root causes, in
which we also utilize the proposed taxonomy as guidance for LLMs. Results show
that the taxonomy can largely improve the performance, thereby confirming its
utility. Nevertheless, the accuracy of root cause identification reaches at
most 33.6%, which indicates that this task still remains challenging. In light
of these results, we also provide actionable guidelines for building such
agentic systems. In summary, this paper provides a reliable dataset of failure
root cause for platform-orchestrated agentic systems, corresponding taxonomy
and benchmark, which serves as a foundation for advancing the development of
more reliable agentic systems.

TL;DR: GUI-Shepherd is a Process Reward Model that provides dense, step-by-step feedback to address sparse rewards and credit assignment problems in autonomous GUI agents, improving performance across online and offline benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents for long-sequence GUI tasks face challenges with sparse rewards and intractable credit assignment problems, which hinder their performance in complex interface interactions.

Method: GUI-Shepherd is trained on a large-scale dataset of 52k interactions with human-annotated scores and GPT-4o generated rationales, serving as both a reward provider for RL training and as a verifier for inference.

Result: On AndroidWorld benchmark, GUI-Shepherd improves success rate by 7.7 points via online PPO, outperforming Outcome Reward Models. As an inference verifier, it brings 5.1 points improvements. Similar gains (2.2 points as reward provider, 4.3 points as verifier) are seen on AndroidControl benchmark.

Conclusion: High-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more capable GUI agents, and GUI-Shepherd presents a generalizable solution that significantly improves performance across diverse settings.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for long-sequence Graphical User Interface tasks are
hindered by sparse rewards and the intractable credit assignment problem. To
address these challenges, we introduce GUI-Shepherd, a Process Reward Model
that provides dense, step-by-step feedback to guide agents. GUI-Shepherd is
trained on a diverse large-scale data set of $52$k interactions that features
human-annotated scores and GPT-4o generated rationales, enabling it to serve
both as a reward provider for RL training and as a verifier for inference. As
far as we know, we are the first to conduct a systematic study of process
supervision in GUI agents, across diverse settings from online long-horizon
tasks to offline single-step prediction. On the online AndroidWorld benchmark,
GUI-Shepherd improves success rate by $7.7$ points via multi-turn online PPO,
significantly outperforming Outcome Reward Model based competitors. When used
as an inference verifier, it brings $5.1$ points improvements. The benefits
generalize to the offline AndroidControl benchmark, with gains of $2.2$ points
as a reward provider and $4.3$ points as a verifier. Collectively, our results
establish that high-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more
capable GUI agents and present a generalizable solution.

TL;DR: OCEAN is an interpretable AI framework that uses object-centric representations and multi-agent negotiation to produce human-understandable visual explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of creating explanations grounded in human-understandable concepts in visual AI systems.

Method: Object-centric representations with transparent multi-agent reasoning process using game-theoretic negotiation to find coherent and discriminative evidence.

Result: Competitive performance with state-of-the-art black-box models, with user studies showing OCEAN's explanations rated as more intuitive and trustworthy than GradCAM and LIME.

Conclusion: OCEAN provides faithful and interpretable decision-making through object-centric reasoning and agent negotiation, making AI explanations more human-understandable.

Abstract: A central challenge in explainable AI, particularly in the visual domain, is
producing explanations grounded in human-understandable concepts. To tackle
this, we introduce OCEAN (Object-Centric Explananda via Agent Negotiation), a
novel, inherently interpretable framework built on object-centric
representations and a transparent multi-agent reasoning process. The
game-theoretic reasoning process drives agents to agree on coherent and
discriminative evidence, resulting in a faithful and interpretable
decision-making process. We train OCEAN end-to-end and benchmark it against
standard visual classifiers and popular posthoc explanation tools like GradCAM
and LIME across two diagnostic multi-object datasets. Our results demonstrate
competitive performance with respect to state-of-the-art black-box models with
a faithful reasoning process, which was reflected by our user study, where
participants consistently rated OCEAN's explanations as more intuitive and
trustworthy.

*Cheng Yang,Jiaxuan Lu,Haiyuan Wan,Junchi Yu,Feiwei Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChemMAS is a multi-agent system that provides explainable reaction condition recommendations through evidence-based reasoning, achieving significant accuracy improvements over existing methods while offering interpretable rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods for chemical reaction condition recommendation lack explainability, limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows where understanding the rationale behind recommendations is crucial.

Method: Proposes ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that decomposes condition prediction into mechanistic grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale aggregation, with each decision backed by chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents.

Result: Achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while providing falsifiable, human-trustable rationales.

Conclusion: ChemMAS establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI in scientific discovery by combining high accuracy with interpretable reasoning for chemical reaction condition recommendation.

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition
parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical
science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is
growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for
reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods
rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions,
limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we
propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an
evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic
grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale
aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded
in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS
achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms
general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable,
human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI
in scientific discovery.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Falcon, a large-scale vision-language safety dataset for evaluating multimodal LLMs, and FalconEye, a specialized evaluator that outperforms existing methods in detecting harmful content in multimodal dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating harmful content are well-developed for text-only LLMs but underdeveloped for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly overlooking the role of visual information in moderating content in visual question answering.

Method: Created Falcon dataset with 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm categories with explicit annotations. Developed FalconEye, a specialized evaluator fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset.

Result: FalconEye reliably identifies harmful content in complex multimodal dialogues and outperforms all baselines in overall accuracy across Falcon-test, VLGuard, and Beavertail-V benchmarks.

Conclusion: FalconEye shows strong potential as a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs, effectively addressing the gap in multimodal safety evaluation.

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating the harmfulness of content generated by large
language models (LLMs) have been well studied. However, approaches tailored to
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain underdeveloped and lack depth.
This work highlights the crucial role of visual information in moderating
content in visual question answering (VQA), a dimension often overlooked in
current research. To bridge this gap, we introduce Falcon, a large-scale
vision-language safety dataset containing 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm
categories. The dataset provides explicit annotations for harmful attributes
across images, instructions, and responses, thereby facilitating a
comprehensive evaluation of the content generated by MLLMs. In addition, it
includes the relevant harm categories along with explanations supporting the
corresponding judgments. We further propose FalconEye, a specialized evaluator
fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that FalconEye reliably identifies harmful content in complex and
safety-critical multimodal dialogue scenarios. It outperforms all other
baselines in overall accuracy across our proposed Falcon-test dataset and two
widely-used benchmarks-VLGuard and Beavertail-V, underscoring its potential as
a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mix-ECom is a new benchmark dataset for evaluating e-commerce agents, featuring mixed dialogue types and complex domain rules from real customer service conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current e-commerce agent benchmarks lack evaluation of mixed-type dialogues and complex domain rules, limiting their ability to assess real-world agent capabilities.

Method: Created Mix-ECom corpus from real customer-service dialogues with privacy removal and CoT process addition. Contains 4,799 samples covering multiple dialogue types, e-commerce tasks, and 82 domain rules. Built baselines and proposed dynamic framework for improvement.

Result: Current e-commerce agents show insufficient capabilities in handling e-commerce dialogues, primarily due to hallucinations caused by complex domain rules.

Conclusion: Mix-ECom addresses gaps in existing benchmarks and reveals limitations of current agents, providing a foundation for future e-commerce agent research and development.

Abstract: E-commerce agents contribute greatly to helping users complete their
e-commerce needs. To promote further research and application of e-commerce
agents, benchmarking frameworks are introduced for evaluating LLM agents in the
e-commerce domain. Despite the progress, current benchmarks lack evaluating
agents' capability to handle mixed-type e-commerce dialogue and complex domain
rules. To address the issue, this work first introduces a novel corpus, termed
Mix-ECom, which is constructed based on real-world customer-service dialogues
with post-processing to remove user privacy and add CoT process. Specifically,
Mix-ECom contains 4,799 samples with multiply dialogue types in each e-commerce
dialogue, covering four dialogue types (QA, recommendation, task-oriented
dialogue, and chit-chat), three e-commerce task types (pre-sales, logistics,
after-sales), and 82 e-commerce rules. Furthermore, this work build baselines
on Mix-Ecom and propose a dynamic framework to further improve the performance.
Results show that current e-commerce agents lack sufficient capabilities to
handle e-commerce dialogues, due to the hallucination cased by complex domain
rules. The dataset will be publicly available.

### [613] [AgentGuard: Runtime Verification of AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23864)
*Roham Koohestani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentGuard is a runtime verification framework for Agentic AI systems that provides continuous probabilistic assurance through dynamic modeling and real-time verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional verification methods are inadequate for autonomous AI systems due to their unpredictability and emergent behaviors, necessitating probabilistic guarantees instead of binary verification.

Method: AgentGuard operates as an inspection layer that abstracts agent I/O into formal events, uses online learning to dynamically build and update Markov Decision Process (MDP) models, and employs probabilistic model checking for real-time verification.

Result: The framework enables continuous, quantitative assurance by modeling emergent behavior and verifying probabilistic properties during runtime.

Conclusion: AgentGuard represents a shift towards probabilistic guarantees for autonomous AI systems, providing a practical approach to runtime verification that addresses the limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: The rapid evolution to autonomous, agentic AI systems introduces significant
risks due to their inherent unpredictability and emergent behaviors; this also
renders traditional verification methods inadequate and necessitates a shift
towards probabilistic guarantees where the question is no longer if a system
will fail, but the probability of its failure within given constraints. This
paper presents AgentGuard, a framework for runtime verification of Agentic AI
systems that provides continuous, quantitative assurance through a new paradigm
called Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance. AgentGuard operates as an inspection
layer that observes an agent's raw I/O and abstracts it into formal events
corresponding to transitions in a state model. It then uses online learning to
dynamically build and update a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that formally
models the agent's emergent behavior. Using probabilistic model checking, the
framework then verifies quantitative properties in real-time.

*Jingyu Liu,Xiaopeng Wu,Jingquan Peng,Kehan Chen,Chuan Yu,Lizhong Ding,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Outcome-based rewards in autonomous agents don't inherently reinforce flawed actions due to expected negative advantage, but gradient coupling between similar samples can strengthen suboptimal actions. A classification-based actor training method is proposed to separate good/bad action embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misconception that outcome-based rewards reinforce flawed middle steps in autonomous agents, and to solve the gradient coupling problem where similar samples interfere with training.

Method: Train the actor to classify good or bad actions to separate their embeddings and alleviate gradient interference between similar samples with limited action spaces.

Result: The proposed method effectively addresses gradient coupling issues and improves training by preventing the reinforcement of flawed actions through gradient interference.

Conclusion: Outcome-based rewards don't inherently reinforce bad actions, but gradient coupling can cause problems. Classification-based actor training successfully mitigates these issues by separating action embeddings.

Abstract: Building autonomous agents capable of solving long-horizon, real-world tasks
has garnered significant research interest. But outcome based rewards may cause
reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward
to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad
actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based
reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which
means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting
for the ``squeezing effect", the probability mass of good actions should
increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows
that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify
gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the
input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited,
therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can
inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input
observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some
flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the
actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad
actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows
its effectiveness.

Conclusion: GPT-OSS-20B exhibits multiple security vulnerabilities in its reasoning capabilities that can be systematically exploited, highlighting the need for improved security measures in open-weight language models with explicit reasoning features.

Abstract: OpenAI's GPT-OSS family provides open-weight language models with explicit
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and a Harmony prompt format. We summarize an
extensive security evaluation of GPT-OSS-20B that probes the model's behavior
under different adversarial conditions. Using the Jailbreak Oracle (JO) [1], a

demonstrate how these behaviors can be exploited on GPT-OSS-20B models, leading
to severe consequences.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper establishes a formal correspondence between fibring of neural networks and fibring of modal logics, using fibred models compatible with neural networks to derive logical expressiveness results for GNNs, GATs, and Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between fibring of neural networks and fibring of modal logics, which were previously introduced but never formally connected, and to enable logical interpretation of neural network theories.

Method: Formalizes fibred models compatible with fibred neural networks and uses this correspondence to analyze logical expressiveness of various neural architectures.

Result: Derives non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders through the fibring framework.

Conclusion: Opens the way for using fibring as a formalism to interpret logical theories learned by neural networks using computational logic tools.

Abstract: Fibring of modal logics is a well-established formalism for combining
countable families of modal logics into a single fibred language with common
semantics, characterized by fibred models. Inspired by this formalism, fibring
of neural networks was introduced as a neurosymbolic framework for combining
learning and reasoning in neural networks. Fibring of neural networks uses the
(pre-)activations of a trained network to evaluate a fibring function computing
the weights of another network whose outputs are injected back into the
original network. However, the exact correspondence between fibring of neural
networks and fibring of modal logics was never formally established. In this
paper, we close this gap by formalizing the idea of fibred models
\emph{compatible} with fibred neural networks. Using this correspondence, we
then derive non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders.
Longer-term, the goal of this paper is to open the way for the use of fibring
as a formalism for interpreting the logical theories learnt by neural networks
with the tools of computational logic.

TL;DR: CANON is a new reinforcement learning method that amplifies the impact of target metrics without assuming their direction, outperforming prior methods on math reasoning and logic tasks while improving token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior RLVR approaches use directional priors through reward shaping that can be overly biased and lead to failure without careful hyperparameter tuning. The authors aim to develop a method that leverages training metrics without presuming their direction.

Method: CANON (Conditional advANtage estimatiON) regroups sampled responses into two groups based on higher or lower values of a target metric, measures which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group comparison, and identifies better responses within the same group.

Result: CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied to response length, it improves token efficiency and yields a better Pareto frontier in performance-cost trade-off.

Conclusion: CANON effectively amplifies the impact of target metrics without directional assumptions, achieving superior performance on reasoning tasks while improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language
models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical
reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length,
have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in
reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward
or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and
preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without
careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased
and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage
estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without
presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses
into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures
which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group
comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In
summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across
three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied
to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more
favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

TL;DR: An evolutionary machine learning approach called \ourmodel uses grammar-guided genetic programming to automatically classify paper relevance for systematic literature reviews, combining textual and bibliometric data while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic literature reviews are time-consuming, and machine learning can automate paper selection to reduce effort in identifying relevant literature from scientific databases.

Method: \ourmodel builds interpretable rule-based classifiers using grammar-guided genetic programming, allowing combination of textual information with bibliometric data not considered by state-of-the-art methods.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that accurate classifiers can be generated without impairing interpretability and using configurable information sources not previously supported.

Conclusion: The proposed evolutionary machine learning approach successfully automates paper selection for literature reviews while maintaining interpretability and supporting diverse data sources.

Abstract: Searching, filtering and analysing scientific literature are time-consuming
tasks when performing a systematic literature review. With the rise of
artificial intelligence, some steps in the review process are progressively
being automated. In particular, machine learning for automatic paper selection
can greatly reduce the effort required to identify relevant literature in
scientific databases. We propose an evolutionary machine learning approach,
called \ourmodel, to automatically determine whether a paper retrieved from a
literature search process is relevant. \ourmodel builds an interpretable
rule-based classifier using grammar-guided genetic programming. The use of a
grammar to define the syntax and the structure of the rules allows \ourmodel to
easily combine the usual textual information with other bibliometric data not
considered by state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments demonstrate that it is
possible to generate accurate classifiers without impairing interpretability
and using configurable information sources not supported so far.

TL;DR: TusoAI is an agentic AI system that autonomously develops and optimizes computational methods for scientific tasks by integrating domain knowledge and performing iterative optimization, outperforming existing methods across various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific discovery is slowed by manual development of computational tools. LLMs offer capabilities in literature synthesis, reasoning with data, and code generation, but existing systems don't effectively integrate domain-specific knowledge for computational method development.

Method: TusoAI takes scientific task descriptions with evaluation functions, integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree representation, and performs iterative domain-specific optimization and model diagnosis to improve candidate solutions.

Result: TusoAI outperforms state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI agents across diverse tasks including single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and satellite-based earth monitoring. In genetics applications, it improved existing methods and uncovered novel biology including 9 new autoimmune disease-T cell associations and 7 unreported disease variant-gene links.

Conclusion: TusoAI demonstrates the potential of agentic AI systems to accelerate computational method development in scientific domains by effectively integrating domain knowledge and performing autonomous optimization, leading to improved performance and novel biological discoveries.

Abstract: Scientific discovery is often slowed by the manual development of
computational tools needed to analyze complex experimental data. Building such
tools is costly and time-consuming because scientists must iteratively review
literature, test modeling and scientific assumptions against empirical data,
and implement these insights into efficient software. Large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing literature,
reasoning with empirical data, and generating domain-specific code, offering
new opportunities to accelerate computational method development. Existing
LLM-based systems either focus on performing scientific analyses using existing
computational methods or on developing computational methods or models for
general machine learning without effectively integrating the often unstructured
knowledge specific to scientific domains. Here, we introduce TusoAI , an
agentic AI system that takes a scientific task description with an evaluation
function and autonomously develops and optimizes computational methods for the
application. TusoAI integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree
representation and performs iterative, domain-specific optimization and model
diagnosis, improving performance over a pool of candidate solutions. We
conducted comprehensive benchmark evaluations demonstrating that TusoAI
outperforms state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI
agents across diverse tasks, such as single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and
satellite-based earth monitoring. Applying TusoAI to two key open problems in
genetics improved existing computational methods and uncovered novel biology,
including 9 new associations between autoimmune diseases and T cell subtypes
and 7 previously unreported links between disease variants linked to their
target genes. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: The paper outlines remaining challenges and proposes insights and practical directions for advancing LLM/Agent-powered data analysis, highlighting the substantial impact of these techniques in both academia and industry.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) and agent techniques for data analysis (a.k.a
LLM/Agent-as-Data-Analyst) have demonstrated substantial impact in both
academica and industry. In comparison with traditional rule or small-model
based approaches, (agentic) LLMs enable complex data understanding, natural
language interfaces, semantic analysis functions, and autonomous pipeline
orchestration. The technical evolution further distills five key design goals
for intelligent data analysis agents, namely semantic-aware design,
modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows,
and support for open-world tasks. From a modality perspective, we review
LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., table question answering
for relational data and NL2GQL for graph data), (ii) semi-structured data
(e.g., markup languages understanding and semi-structured table modeling),
(iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, document understanding,

### [622] [Do Repetitions Matter? Strengthening Reliability in LLM Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24086)
*Miguel Angel Alvarado Gonzalez,Michelle Bruno Hernandez,Miguel Angel Peñaloza Perez,Bruno Lopez Orozco,Jesus Tadeo Cruz Soto,Sandra Malagon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Single-run LLM evaluations are unreliable; using 2-3 repetitions significantly improves ranking stability while remaining feasible for small teams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM leaderboards rely on single stochastic runs, but the reliability of such evaluations and the number of repetitions needed for stable conclusions is unclear.

Method: Re-evaluated 8 state-of-the-art models on AI4Math Benchmark with 3 independent runs per setting, using mixed-effects logistic regression, domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run reliability assessment.

Result: Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 83% of slices invert at least one pairwise rank. Averaging runs yields modest standard error reduction (~5%) but large ranking gains; two runs remove ~83% of single-run inversions.

Conclusion: Practitioners should treat evaluation as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use ≥2 repetitions under stochastic decoding to improve robustness while remaining feasible for small teams.

Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many
repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We
re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three
independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression,
domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run
reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings
shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at
least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero
sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass
correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to
three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run
inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation
as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under
stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining
feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world
reliability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fathom-DeepResearch is a two-model agentic system for complex information-seeking tasks, featuring Fathom-Search-4B for evidence-based web investigation and Fathom-Synthesizer-4B for structured report generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance tool-integrated reasoning for agentic applications, particularly addressing the need for reliable, multi-turn web search capabilities and comprehensive information synthesis in open-ended research tasks.

Method: Developed two specialized models: Fathom-Search-4B trained with DUETQA dataset, RAPO reinforcement learning, and step-level reward system; and Fathom-Synthesizer-4B for converting search traces into structured reports.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance in open-weights category on DeepSearch benchmarks and demonstrated strong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25, GPQA-Diamond, and MedQA.

Conclusion: The Fathom-DeepResearch system successfully enables reliable multi-turn tool-calling and comprehensive information synthesis, representing significant progress in agentic reasoning systems for complex research tasks.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning has emerged as a key focus for enabling agentic
applications. Among these, DeepResearch Agents have gained significant
attention for their strong performance on complex, open-ended
information-seeking tasks. We introduce Fathom-DeepResearch, an agentic system
composed of two specialized models. The first is Fathom-Search-4B, a DeepSearch
model trained from Qwen3-4B and optimized for evidence-based investigation
through live web search and targeted webpage querying. Its training combines
three advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent
self-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source
grounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes
multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum
pruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and
(iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive
behavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory
breadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of
tool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is
Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn
DeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for
comprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES,
WebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating
strong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25,
GPQA-Diamond, and MedQA.

TL;DR: A modular AI agent architecture for natural language interaction with enterprise data warehouses, featuring transparent decision-making, automated evaluation, and statistical context to ensure trustworthiness in high-stakes domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between natural language interfaces and complex enterprise data warehouses, enabling non-technical users to access data while maintaining transparency and reliability in data-sensitive domains.

Method: Component-based architecture with multi-layered reasoning framework, automated evaluation system, statistical context module, and integration with BigQuery ecosystem for secure data retrieval and business rule application.

Result: Successfully demonstrated through insurance claims processing case study, creating a robust, evaluable, and trustworthy system for LLM-powered agents in high-stakes domains.

Conclusion: The integrated agent-development-with-evaluation framework provides an effective approach for deploying trustworthy AI agents in data-sensitive enterprise environments with full interpretability and reliability.

Abstract: This article presents a modular, component-based architecture for developing
and evaluating AI agents that bridge the gap between natural language
interfaces and complex enterprise data warehouses. The system directly
addresses core challenges in data accessibility by enabling non-technical users
to interact with complex data warehouses through a conversational interface,
translating ambiguous user intent into precise, executable database queries to
overcome semantic gaps. A cornerstone of the design is its commitment to
transparent decision-making, achieved through a multi-layered reasoning
framework that explains the "why" behind every decision, allowing for full
interpretability by tracing conclusions through specific, activated business
rules and data points. The architecture integrates a robust quality assurance
mechanism via an automated evaluation framework that serves multiple functions:
it enables performance benchmarking by objectively measuring agent performance
against golden standards, and it ensures system reliability by automating the
detection of performance regressions during updates. The agent's analytical
depth is enhanced by a statistical context module, which quantifies deviations
from normative behavior, ensuring all conclusions are supported by quantitative
evidence including concrete data, percentages, and statistical comparisons. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this integrated agent-development-with-evaluation
framework through a case study on an insurance claims processing system. The
agent, built on a modular architecture, leverages the BigQuery ecosystem to
perform secure data retrieval, apply domain-specific business rules, and
generate human-auditable justifications. The results confirm that this approach
creates a robust, evaluable, and trustworthy system for deploying LLM-powered
agents in data-sensitive, high-stakes domains.

*Yuhui Wang,Changjiang Li,Guangke Chen,Jiacheng Liang,Ting Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large reasoning models exhibit answer-reasoning inconsistency due to competing mechanisms: CoT reasoning vs. memory retrieval. FARL framework addresses this by integrating memory unlearning with reinforcement learning to suppress retrieval shortcuts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LRMs' final answers often contradict their own reasoning traces, hypothesizing this stems from two competing mechanisms: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments with misleading cues during reasoning and corrupted answers during retrieval. Introduced FARL framework that integrates memory unlearning with reinforcement learning to suppress retrieval shortcuts.

Result: Confirmed both mechanisms operate simultaneously, with dominance influenced by problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches. Models can exploit retrieval as a shortcut to "hack" reward signals.

Conclusion: FARL framework successfully promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities by suppressing retrieval shortcuts during fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving
complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent
studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning
traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing
mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test
this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with
misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our
results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate
simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:
problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement
learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in
current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval
mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and
undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we
introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning
with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts
during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and
enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

### [626] [Robust Preference Optimization: Aligning Language Models with Noisy Preference Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24159)
*Xiaoyang Cao,Zelai Xu,Mo Guang,Kaiwen Long,Michiel A. Bakker,Yu Wang,Chao Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RPO is a meta-framework that transforms existing preference alignment algorithms into robust versions by addressing noisy and heterogeneous human preference data through an EM algorithm that re-weights training data based on label correctness probabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard human preference alignment methods like RLHF assume homogeneous human preferences and noiseless data, but in reality human preferences are pluralistic and annotations contain errors, creating discrepancies that degrade model performance.

Method: RPO uses an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to infer posterior probabilities of label correctness, adaptively re-weighting each data point in the training loss to mitigate noise. It establishes a theoretical link between preference losses and probabilistic models to systematically transform existing alignment algorithms.

Result: RPO consistently enhanced four state-of-the-art alignment algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, CPO). When applied to Mistral and Llama 3 models, RPO achieved win rate gains of up to 7.0% on AlpacaEval 2 and 5.4% on Arena-Hard.

Conclusion: RPO effectively addresses the challenges of noisy and heterogeneous human preference data, providing a robust meta-framework that improves existing alignment methods and theoretically converges to the true noise level with perfectly calibrated models.

Abstract: Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone technology for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are all
underpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are
homogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data
is noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human
preference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a
discrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which
can misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge,
we introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of
each label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point
in the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by
establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their
corresponding probabilistic models. This generalization enables the systematic
transformation of existing alignment algorithms into their robust counterparts,
elevating RPO from a specific algorithm to a meta-framework for robust
preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a
perfectly calibrated model, RPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise
level of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate RPO's effectiveness as a
meta-framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment
algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO). When applied to Mistral and Llama 3
models, the RPO-enhanced methods achieve substantial win rate gains on
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, with improvements of up to 7.0% and 5.4%,
respectively.

### [627] [Humanline: Online Alignment as Perceptual Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24207)
*Sijia Liu,Niklas Muennighoff,Kawin Ethayarajh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Online alignment methods like GRPO outperform offline methods like DPO because they better approximate human perceptual biases in probability assessment, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping naturally captures these biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why online alignment methods perform better than offline methods, drawing insights from behavioral economics and prospect theory about human perception of probability.

Method: Proposed a design pattern that explicitly incorporates perceptual distortions of probability into objectives like DPO/KTO/GRPO, creating 'humanline' variants that mimic human perception rather than relying on online on-policy data.

Result: Humanline variants trained with offline off-policy data can match the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and unverifiable tasks.

Conclusion: The online/offline dichotomy is incidental to maximizing human utility - the key is training data selection that mimics human perception, enabling faster, cheaper, and more flexible post-training without performance loss.

Abstract: Online alignment (e.g., GRPO) is generally more performant than offline
alignment (e.g., DPO) -- but why? Drawing on prospect theory from behavioral
economics, we propose a human-centric explanation. We prove that online
on-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what
the model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to
just stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive
probability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our
theory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental
to maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by
selectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception,
rather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would
allow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing
performance. To this end, we propose a design pattern that explicitly
incorporates perceptual distortions of probability into objectives like
DPO/KTO/GRPO, creating humanline variants of them. Surprisingly, we find that
these humanline variants, even when trained with offline off-policy data, can
match the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and
unverifiable tasks.

*Shaobin Ling,Yun Wang,Chenyou Fan,Tin Lun Lam,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ELHPlan introduces Action Chains as planning primitives for LLM-based multi-robot collaboration, achieving comparable task success with only 24% of tokens compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based multi-robot collaboration faces fundamental trade-offs: declarative methods lack adaptability in dynamic environments, while iterative methods incur prohibitive computational costs that scale poorly with team size and task complexity.

Method: ELHPlan uses Action Chains (sequences of actions bound to sub-goal intentions) and operates via a cyclical process: constructing intention-bound action sequences, proactive validation for conflicts/feasibility, targeted refinement, and execution. It also introduces comprehensive efficiency metrics including token consumption and planning time.

Result: Experiments on TDW-MAT and C-WAH benchmarks show ELHPlan achieves comparable task success rates while consuming only 24% of the tokens required by state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ELHPlan establishes a new efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based multi-agent planning systems by balancing adaptability and efficiency through Action Chains and proactive validation mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable intelligent multi-robot collaboration but
face fundamental trade-offs: declarative methods lack adaptability in dynamic
environments, while iterative methods incur prohibitive computational costs
that scale poorly with team size and task complexity. In this paper, we propose
ELHPlan, a novel framework that introduces Action Chains--sequences of actions
explicitly bound to sub-goal intentions--as the fundamental planning primitive.
ELHPlan operates via a cyclical process: 1) constructing intention-bound action
sequences, 2) proactively validating for conflicts and feasibility, 3) refining
issues through targeted mechanisms, and 4) executing validated actions. This
design balances adaptability and efficiency by providing sufficient planning
horizons while avoiding expensive full re-planning. We further propose
comprehensive efficiency metrics, including token consumption and planning
time, to more holistically evaluate multi-agent collaboration. Our experiments
on benchmark TDW-MAT and C-WAH demonstrate that ELHPlan achieves comparable
task success rates while consuming only 24% of the tokens required by
state-of-the-art methods. Our research establishes a new
efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based multi-agent planning systems.

*Yixin He,Lumingyuan Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FR-Ponder is a framework that enables adaptive reasoning compute allocation in LLMs through latent steering, allowing models to adjust reasoning depth based on input complexity without modifying backbone weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform compute depth across all inputs, wasting computation on simple queries and potentially under-thinking complex ones.

Method: Uses a <1M-param controller that observes hidden states to decide whether to halt or apply ponder steps by adding pre-computed steering vectors to frozen representations. Employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for reward signals and curriculum learning to balance performance and computational cost.

Result: On GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks, FR-Ponder improves the compute-accuracy frontier, achieving lower FLOPs with better matched accuracy compared to early-exit baselines. Learned compute allocation correlates with problem difficulty.

Conclusion: FR-Ponder provides an effective framework for instance-adaptive reasoning compute that outperforms uniform compute approaches while maintaining backbone model integrity.

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning,
yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform
depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially
under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph,
backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning
compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden
states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a
pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the
latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO
from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance
performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth,
achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum
learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute
allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder
improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better
matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without
modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering
directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem
difficulty.

*Yuanyi Wang,Yanggan Gu,Yiming Zhang,Qi Zhou,Zhaoyi Yan,Congkai Xie,Xinyao Wang,Jianbo Yuan,Hongxia Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Identifies a power law for language model merging that predicts performance gains based on model size and number of experts, enabling predictive planning for model composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish quantitative scaling laws for language model merging, which is widely used but lacks predictive rules for returns when adding experts or scaling model size.

Method: Empirical study of scaling laws measured by cross-entropy, analyzing how model size and expert number affect performance across diverse architectures and merging methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE).

Result: Found a compact power law where size-dependent floor decreases with model capacity and merging tail shows diminishing returns with more experts. The law holds in-domain and cross-domain, fits measured curves accurately, and explains regularities like early gains and reduced variability.

Conclusion: The scaling law enables predictive planning for model merging, making it a computationally efficient alternative to multitask training and suggesting a principle for building AGI-level systems through specialist composition.

Abstract: We study empirical scaling laws for language model merging measured by
cross-entropy. Despite its wide practical use, merging lacks a quantitative
rule that predicts returns as we add experts or scale the model size. We
identify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the
size-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail
exhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds
in-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse
architectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust
regularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts
are included. Building on this, we present a simple theory that explains why
gains fall roughly as 1/k and links the floor and tail to properties of the
base model and the diversity across domains. This law enables predictive
planning: estimate how many experts are needed to reach a target loss, decide
when to stop adding experts, and trade off scaling the base model versus adding
experts under a fixed budget--turning merging from heuristic practice into a
computationally efficient, planable alternative to multitask training. This
suggests a scaling principle for distributed generative AI: predictable gains
can be achieved by composing specialists, offering a complementary path toward
AGI-level systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SpecExit is a novel framework that addresses overthinking in large reasoning models by predicting both future tokens and early-exit signals from a lightweight draft model, achieving 66% reduction in generation length and 2.5x speedup in latency without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs with high latency, limiting real-world deployment. Existing early-exit mechanisms have detection overhead that limits latency gains and generalizability.

Method: Proposes SpecExit framework that predicts future tokens and early-exit signals directly from a lightweight draft model without probing overhead, leveraging hidden states inspired by speculative decoding.

Result: Achieves 66% reduction in average generation length and 2.5x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to speculative decoding baseline, without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages inherent signals from hidden states for early-exit, suggesting broader use of hidden states for efficient reasoning in large models.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models
(LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and
incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world
deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed
to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach
can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy.
However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead
that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their
generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states
in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts
both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft
model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements,
reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in
end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without
compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden
states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of
hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A system that learns collaborative physical tasks through program synthesis using narrated demonstrations, enabling users to teach, inspect, and correct system behavior without coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teaching systems collaborative physical tasks is challenging due to the need to infer user assumptions about teammate intent, requiring interpretable and correctable representations.

Method: Frames collaborative task learning as program synthesis, representing behavior as editable programs using narrated demonstrations (paired physical actions and natural language) as a unified teaching modality.

Result: In a study with 20 users teaching soccer tactics, 70% successfully refined learned programs to match intent, and 90% found it easy to correct programs.

Conclusion: The approach enables effective teaching of collaborative physical activities, though challenges in program representation and teaching methods were identified, with mitigation strategies proposed.

Abstract: Teaching systems physical tasks is a long standing goal in HCI, yet most
prior work has focused on non collaborative physical activities. Collaborative
tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions
about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic
process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and
correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address
this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis
problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated
demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified
modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without
requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system
to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users
taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of
participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90
percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced
unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to
teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline
mitigation strategies.

*Yuwei Hu,Xinyi Huang,Zhewei Wei,Yongchao Liu,Chuntao Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs for graph reasoning are underperforming due to improper focus on replicating rather than designing graph algorithms. A new benchmark GraphAlgorithm and baseline Simple-RTC method achieve superior performance by redirecting reasoning focus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs show underwhelming performance on graph reasoning tasks due to improper reasoning focus and inadequate benchmarks that don't truly evaluate graph reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC) which guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to solve tasks. Also constructs GraphAlgorithm benchmark with 239 problems and 3,041 test instances from competition platforms.

Result: Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on the GraphAlgorithm benchmark.

Conclusion: Redirecting reasoning focus from algorithm replication to algorithm design enables LLMs to solve most graph reasoning tasks. The strong Simple-RTC baseline encourages future advancements in LLMs for graph reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Graph Reasoning have been extensively
studied over the past two years, involving enabling LLMs to understand graph
structures and reason on graphs to solve various graph problems, with graph
algorithm problems being the most prevalent. Recent studies underscore the
potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is
underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and
benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should
strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely
underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning
focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily
solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the
graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging
GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041
test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a
simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which
guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph
reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing
benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on
the GraphAlgorithm benchmark. This strong baseline encourages further
advancements in LLMs for Graph Reasoning in the future.

*Yuhua Jiang,Jiawei Huang,Yufeng Yuan,Xin Mao,Yu Yue,Qianchuan Zhao,Lin Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR improves LLMs on reasoning tasks but suffers from limited exploration due to peaked initial policies, suppressing solution diversity. The paper introduces Risk-Sensitive RL with RS-GRPO algorithm to enable deeper exploration while maintaining single-solution accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods face an exploration dilemma where pre-trained LLMs' peaked initial policies confine RL to narrow solutions, boosting pass@1 but suppressing diversity and pass@k performance, limiting discovery of new reasoning strategies.

Method: Proposed Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning framework with risk-seeking objective that interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to RS-GRPO algorithm that amplifies learning from challenging prompts with minimal code modifications.

Result: On six mathematical reasoning benchmarks with five different LLMs, RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k performance while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

Conclusion: Risk-Sensitive RL framework with RS-GRPO effectively addresses the exploration dilemma in RLVR, enabling deeper exploration and improved multi-solution performance without compromising single-solution accuracy.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However,
existing methods suffer from an exploration dilemma: the sharply peaked initial
policies of pre-trained LLMs confine standard RL algorithms to a narrow set of
solutions, boosting single-solution accuracy (pass@1) but suppressing solution
diversity and multi-solution performance (pass@k). As a result, RLVR often
distills existing capabilities rather than discovering new reasoning
strategies. To overcome this, we introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement
Learning framework. Our approach employs a risk-seeking objective that
interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to a novel algorithm,
Risk-Sensitive GRPO (RS-GRPO), which drives deeper exploration by amplifying
learning from challenging prompts. Remarkably, RS-GRPO is simple to implement,
requiring only minor code modifications. On six mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and with five different LLMs, RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k
performance while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to
improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However,
traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its
inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a
novel approach for Patient Messaging Creation and Optimization using Agentic
AI. Built on the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy, PAME-AI
offers a structured framework to move from raw data to actionable insights for
high-performance messaging design. PAME-AI is composed of a system of
specialized computational agents that progressively transform raw experimental
data into actionable message design strategies. We demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness through a two-stage experiment, comprising of 444,691 patient
encounters in Stage 1 and 74,908 in Stage 2. The best-performing generated
message achieved 68.76% engagement compared to the 61.27% baseline,
representing a 12.2\% relative improvement in click-through rates. This agentic
architecture enables parallel processing, hypothesis validation, and continuous
learning, making it particularly suitable for large-scale healthcare
communication optimization.

*Zihao Zhu,Xinyu Wu,Gehan Hu,Siwei Lyu,Ke Xu,Baoyuan Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdvChain is an alignment method that teaches Large Reasoning Models to self-correct during Chain-of-Thought reasoning, addressing the snowball effect where minor reasoning deviations amplify into harmful compliance or excessive refusal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety CoT tuning methods suffer from the snowball effect - minor reasoning deviations progressively amplify throughout multi-step reasoning, leading to harmful compliance or excessive refusal, because models imitate perfect reasoning without learning self-correction.

Method: AdvChain uses adversarial CoT tuning with Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, teaching models to recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions through dynamic self-correction.

Result: AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal on benign prompts, achieving superior safety-utility balance without compromising reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: AdvChain establishes a new direction for building more robust and reliable reasoning models by teaching dynamic self-correction during multi-step reasoning processes.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the
multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond
conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current
safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning
deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to
either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models
being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to
self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment
paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT
tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing
Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to
recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive
experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against
jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal
on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without
compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for
building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

TL;DR: G-reasoner is a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation models to enhance reasoning over graph-structured knowledge, addressing limitations in existing retrieval-augmented generation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak modeling of knowledge structure, while LLMs cannot effectively reason over graph-structured data. Current GraphRAG approaches have scalability and generalization issues.

Method: Proposes QuadGraph (4-layer abstraction to unify knowledge sources), a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that captures graph topology and textual semantics, integrated with LLMs. Uses mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing for scalability.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmarks show G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency and cross-graph generalization.

Conclusion: G-reasoner successfully bridges the gap between LLMs and graph-structured knowledge, providing a scalable and effective solution for knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by
static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs
struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak
modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model
relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot
effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG
(GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and
enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc
graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder
scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present
G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation
models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our
approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies
heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on
this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly
captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to
enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and
efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are
implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency
and cross-graph generalization.

TL;DR: The paper proposes SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark for scientific answer verification, and SCI-Verifier, a reasoning-augmented verifier, to address limitations in existing verification methods for LLMs in scientific domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing verification studies in scientific domains lack systematic evaluation standards and sufficient disciplinary coverage, and rely heavily on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios and limits cross-disciplinary generalization.

Method: At data level: Construct SCI-VerifyBench covering mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA using real LLM responses enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations. At model level: Develop SCI-Verifier, a unified reasoning-augmented verifier through post-training to enhance logical reasoning and equivalence judgment capabilities.

Result: SCI-VerifyBench provides rigorous evaluation of verification ability with quality and diversity ensured by model-based and expert annotations. SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains through principled scientific verification.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent
expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing
verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations:
(a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient
disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b)
heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces
their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their
cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct
SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics,
biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real
LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations
that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert
annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of
verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of
reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified
reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training,
SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment
capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together,
SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific
verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to
enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedMMV is a controllable multimodal multi-agent framework that addresses instability and hallucination in medical AI systems by using diversified reasoning rollouts, structured evidence graphs, and uncertainty scoring to improve reliability and verifiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models show instability in early evidence interpretation that leads to hallucination and inconsistent conclusions in clinical reasoning, highlighting the need for more reliable and auditable AI systems for medical decision support.

Method: MedMMV uses a multi-agent framework with diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate steps in structured evidence graphs supervised by a Hallucination Detector, and aggregates candidate paths using a Combined Uncertainty scorer.

Result: On six medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and demonstrates superior reliability. Blind physician evaluations confirm increased reasoning truthfulness without sacrificing informational content.

Conclusion: By controlling instability through a verifiable multi-agent process, MedMMV provides a robust path toward deploying trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes clinical domains.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
promising performance on medical benchmarks and in preliminary trials as
clinical assistants. Yet, our pilot audit of diagnostic cases uncovers a
critical failure mode: instability in early evidence interpretation precedes
hallucination, creating branching reasoning trajectories that cascade into
globally inconsistent conclusions. This highlights the need for clinical
reasoning agents that constrain stochasticity and hallucination while producing
auditable decision flows. We introduce MedMMV, a controllable multimodal
multi-agent framework for reliable and verifiable clinical reasoning. MedMMV
stabilizes reasoning through diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate
steps in a structured evidence graph under the supervision of a Hallucination
Detector, and aggregates candidate paths with a Combined Uncertainty scorer. On
six medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and, more
critically, demonstrates superior reliability. Blind physician evaluations
confirm that MedMMV substantially increases reasoning truthfulness without
sacrificing informational content. By controlling instability through a
verifiable, multi-agent process, our framework provides a robust path toward
deploying trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes domains like clinical decision
support.

TL;DR: Fin-Solution 2.O introduces Fin-Vault dataset and Fin-Ally model to address unprofessional responses in financial chatbots by integrating commonsense reasoning and human-like conversational dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem of unprofessional or flippant remarks in financial advisory chatbots due to large-scale fine-tuning of LLMs, and the scarcity of domain-specific datasets that has limited previous research to isolated components.

Method: Developed Fin-Vault dataset (1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues) and Fin-Ally unified model that integrates commonsense reasoning, politeness, and conversational dynamics using COMET-BART-embedded commonsense context and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Result: Incorporating commonsense context enables language models to generate more refined, textually precise, and professionally grounded financial guidance, extending beyond basic account management to personalized budgeting, real-time expense tracking, and automated financial planning.

Conclusion: The approach positions Fin-Solution 2.O as a next-generation AI solution for the FinTech sector, demonstrating that unified integration of commonsense reasoning and human-like dynamics can significantly improve financial advisory chatbot performance.

Abstract: The exponential technological breakthrough of the FinTech industry has
significantly enhanced user engagement through sophisticated advisory chatbots.
However, large-scale fine-tuning of LLMs can occasionally yield unprofessional
or flippant remarks, such as ``With that money, you're going to change the
world,'' which, though factually correct, can be contextually inappropriate and
erode user trust. The scarcity of domain-specific datasets has led previous
studies to focus on isolated components, such as reasoning-aware frameworks or
the enhancement of human-like response generation. To address this research
gap, we present Fin-Solution 2.O, an advanced solution that 1) introduces the
multi-turn financial conversational dataset, Fin-Vault, and 2) incorporates a
unified model, Fin-Ally, which integrates commonsense reasoning, politeness,
and human-like conversational dynamics. Fin-Ally is powered by
COMET-BART-embedded commonsense context and optimized with a Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) mechanism to generate human-aligned responses. The novel
Fin-Vault dataset, consisting of 1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues, enables
Fin-Ally to extend beyond basic account management to provide personalized
budgeting, real-time expense tracking, and automated financial planning. Our
comprehensive results demonstrate that incorporating commonsense context
enables language models to generate more refined, textually precise, and
professionally grounded financial guidance, positioning this approach as a
next-generation AI solution for the FinTech sector. Dataset and codes are

*Jie Ma,Shihao Qi,Rui Xing,Ziang Yin,Bifan Wei,Jun Liu,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AMCS is an adaptive Monte Carlo search framework that improves process data generation for training Process Reward Models (PRMs) by dynamically allocating samples and using adaptive exploration-exploitation policies, achieving superior mathematical reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for process data generation use fixed-budget sampling and inefficient search strategies, leading to inefficiency and inflexibility in training high-quality PRMs for mathematical reasoning.

Method: AMCS adaptively refines node value estimation by allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps and enhances path expansion through a Monte Carlo algorithm with temporally adaptive policy that transitions from broad exploration to focused exploitation.

Result: Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieves 76.2% accuracy on MATH500, outperforming all baseline PRMs. A 7B model supervised by it surpasses a 72B model with weaker supervision, and maintains strong generalization on out-of-distribution problems.

Conclusion: AMCS provides an effective framework for adaptive process data generation, significantly improving PRM training and mathematical reasoning capabilities while demonstrating strong generalization performance.

Abstract: The quality of process data plays a key role in training a Process Reward
Model (PRM), which can enhance the complex mathematical reasoning capability of
large language models. Existing methods estimate the quality of reasoning steps
based on a fixed-budget sampling strategy and navigate a vast search space to
perform path expansion during the automated data generation process, resulting
in their inefficiency and inflexibility. To address these issues, we propose
Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS), a framework that transforms data generation
from fixed, static to adaptive, dynamic search at the level of node value
estimation and path expansion. On one hand, AMCS adaptively refines estimation
by allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps while using fewer
samples for those that are easier to estimate. On the other hand, it enhances
the path expansion through a Monte Carlo algorithm with a temporally adaptive
policy that begins with broad exploration and gradually shifts toward
exploiting the most promising directions. With AMCS, we construct a large-scale
dataset MathSearch-200K of about 200K process supervision examples for training
PRMs. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive
experiments on four mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results
show that Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieves up to 76.2% accuracy on MATH500
with GLM-4-9B, outperforming all baseline PRMs. Notably, a 7B model supervised
by Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS surpasses a 72B model with weaker supervision.
Moreover, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS maintains consistent advantages on
out-of-distribution problems, demonstrating strong generalization capability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRISM is a novel framework that decouples mathematical reasoning into strategy planning and execution stages, using adaptive routing to dynamically select reasoning strategies based on problem-specific requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use fixed strategies for mathematical reasoning, which cannot adapt to problem-specific requirements and overlook the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency.

Method: PRISM uses a two-stage approach: strategy planning with a lightweight Strategy Adapter trained on a multi-strategy preference dataset (MathStrat), and targeted execution with adaptive routing that selects single-strategy, dual-strategy verification, or multi-strategy exploration based on confidence levels.

Result: PRISM consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble baselines across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across different base models.

Conclusion: The adaptive routing approach shows strong benefits for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures, providing a more flexible and effective framework than fixed-strategy methods.

Abstract: Existing methods usually leverage a fixed strategy, such as natural language
reasoning, code-augmented reasoning, tool-integrated reasoning, or
ensemble-based reasoning, to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
mathematical reasoning. Our analysis reveals that the single strategy cannot
adapt to problem-specific requirements and thus overlooks the trade-off between
effectiveness and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Planning and
Routing through Instance-Specific Modeling (PRISM), a novel framework that
decouples mathematical reasoning into two stages: strategy planning and
targeted execution. Specifically, we first curate a multi-strategy preference
dataset, which we call MathStrat, capturing correctness, process quality, and
computational efficiency for each problem--strategy pair. Then, we train a
lightweight Strategy Adapter based on the dataset to obtain confidence
distributions over the mentioned four reasoning strategies. At inference time,
an adaptive routing policy dynamically tailors the reasoning approach based on
predictor confidence. It directs the model to use single-strategy execution for
high-confidence predictions, dual-strategy verification for competitive
scenarios, or comprehensive multi-strategy exploration for uncertain cases.
Extensive experiments across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that PRISM consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble
baselines, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across different
base models. The adaptive routing approach shows particularly strong benefits
for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures. Our code

TL;DR: The paper proposes Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO), a method to align Large Reasoning Models' chain-of-thought reasoning with safety by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and using preference learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook the safety of reasoning itself in Large Reasoning Models, allowing harmful content to persist in chain-of-thought reasoning even when final responses appear safe, posing potential risks if exploited by malicious users.

Method: IPO uses process supervision to enforce safe reasoning by: 1) substituting compliance steps with safety triggers, 2) constructing pairs for preference learning with strong signals based on insights about critical safety triggers, compliance cues, and corrective interventions.

Result: IPO reduces harmfulness by over 30% relative to SFT-based and RL-based baselines on jailbreak and adversarial safety benchmarks, while preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The work highlights the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning safety and provides a practical path to safer Large Reasoning Models through the proposed IPO method.

Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex
problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content
that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this
issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance
of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks
in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by
malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of
reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.
However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout
diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first
delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical
insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps
of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe
continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe
trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened
Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning
by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs
for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and
adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall
safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and
RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while
preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results
highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a
practical path to safer LRMs.

evolution is digital twin technology, an adaptive virtual replica that
continuously monitors and integrates sensor data to simulate and improve asset
performance. Despite remarkable progress in digital twin implementations, such
as considering DT in predictive maintenance for industrial engineering. This

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Process reward models (PRMs) improve LLM reasoning but struggle with domain generalization. ContextPRM shifts focus from domain knowledge to logical flow modeling, achieving better cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRMs show strong mathematical reasoning but limited generalization to other domains due to domain-specific training data and knowledge-based learning patterns.

Method: Shift learning objective to model domain-agnostic logical flow, focusing on contextual coherence between chain-of-thought steps. Implement novel data annotation and training framework.

Result: ContextPRM achieves 6.5% average accuracy improvement over majority voting baseline across nine non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro, outperforming other PRMs (2.2% from VersaPRM, 0.5% from math-focused PRMs).

Conclusion: Modeling logical flow rather than domain knowledge enables consistent performance across both mathematical and non-mathematical domains, significantly improving PRM generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have demonstrated significant efficacy in
enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by leveraging test-time scaling (TTS). However, while most PRMs exhibit
substantial gains in mathematical domains, the scarcity of domain-specific
training data and knowledge-based learning patterns limits their generalization
ability when faced with other domains. To address this limitation, we shift the
learning objective from verifying domain-specific knowledge to modeling
domain-agnostic logical flow. Centering on contextual coherence between
chain-of-thought (CoT) steps, our approach is realized through a novel data
annotation and training framework, which enhances the model's generalization
capabilities across diverse domains. For instance, our resulting model,
ContextPRM, achieves a notable 6.5% average accuracy improvement over the

*Vasileios Balafas,Dimos Tsouros,Nikolaos Ploskas,Kostas Stergiou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid constraint acquisition framework combining passive learning, interactive refinement with probabilistic confidence scores, and active learning to prevent over-fitting while maintaining manageable query complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address over-fitting in constraint acquisition when trained on limited data, and reduce query intensity of purely active methods.

Method: Integrates passive learning for candidate generation, query-driven interactive refinement with probabilistic confidence scores, specialized subset exploration to recover valid substructures, and final active learning for completeness.

Result: Achieves high target model coverage and accuracy from limited examples with manageable query complexity in diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework represents substantial advancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Manual modeling in Constraint Programming is a substantial bottleneck, which
Constraint Acquisition (CA) aims to automate. However, passive CA methods are
prone to over-fitting, often learning models that include spurious global
constraints when trained on limited data, while purely active methods can be
query-intensive. We introduce a hybrid CA framework specifically designed to
address the challenge of over-fitting in CA. Our approach integrates passive
learning for initial candidate generation, a query-driven interactive
refinement phase that utilizes probabilistic confidence scores (initialized by
machine learning priors) to systematically identify over-fitted constraints,
and a specialized subset exploration mechanism to recover valid substructures
from rejected candidates. A final active learning phase ensures model
completeness. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
interactive refinement phase is crucial for achieving high target model
coverage and overall model accuracy from limited examples, doing so with
manageable query complexity. This framework represents a substantial
advancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited
scenarios.

Conclusion: NMT-Net provides a scalable, adaptable solution for multi-task and continual learning in time series prediction, with code available on GitHub.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to Dynamic Artificial Neural Networks
(D-ANNs) for multi-task demand forecasting called Neuroplastic Multi-Task
Network (NMT-Net). Unlike conventional methods focusing on inference-time
dynamics or computational efficiency, our proposed method enables structural
adaptability of the computational graph during training, inspired by
neuroplasticity as seen in biological systems. Each new task triggers a dynamic
network adaptation, including similarity-based task identification and
selective training of candidate ANN heads, which are then assessed and
integrated into the model based on their performance. We evaluated our
framework using three real-world multi-task demand forecasting datasets from
Kaggle. We demonstrated its superior performance and consistency, achieving
lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and
state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods. NMT-Net offers a scalable,

TL;DR: EvoPH is a novel framework that co-evolves prompts and heuristic algorithms using LLMs, integrating island migration and elite selection to avoid local optima in automatic algorithm design for combinatorial optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional heuristic algorithms require extensive domain expertise and implementation effort, while existing LLM-based approaches risk stagnating in local optima during automatic heuristics design.

Method: EvoPH integrates island migration model with elite selection algorithm to simulate diverse heuristics populations, co-evolving prompts and heuristic algorithms guided by performance feedback.

Result: EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error against optimal solutions on Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem datasets compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The framework advances automatic algorithm design with LLMs by effectively preventing local optima stagnation through co-evolution of prompts and heuristics.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with
handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and
significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the
potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models
(LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These
approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as
mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such
methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we
propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics
(EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the
island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse
heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic
algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two
problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error
against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of
automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent agents capable of learning from offline data in complex environments.

Abstract: World models learn general knowledge from videos and simulate experience for
training behaviors in imagination, offering a path towards intelligent agents.
However, previous world models have been unable to accurately predict object
interactions in complex environments. We introduce Dreamer 4, a scalable agent
that learns to solve control tasks by reinforcement learning inside of a fast
and accurate world model. In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model
accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming
previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time
interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and
an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general
action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract
the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the
challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning
with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment
interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of
over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels. By learning behaviors
in imagination, Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft
purely from offline data, without environment interaction. Our work provides a
scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a human-agent teaching architecture for few-shot learning of subjective tasks, specifically applied to ingredient substitution in recipes, achieving half the performance with only 100 examples compared to 50k examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replicate human ability to learn quickly from few examples, especially for subjective tasks with scarce data, through intuitive human-agent interaction.

Method: Human-agent teaching architecture with demonstrations, domain knowledge integration, efficient learning from limited examples, and strategic example selection to minimize redundancy.

Result: Agent achieves half its task performance after only 100 examples compared to full training set of 50k examples, showing efficient generalization.

Conclusion: Strategic example ordering combined with external symbolic knowledge enables agents to generalize more efficiently from few examples in subjective tasks.

Abstract: Humans quickly learn new concepts from a small number of examples.
Replicating this capacity with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has proven
to be challenging. When it comes to learning subjective tasks-where there is an
evident scarcity of data-this capacity needs to be recreated. In this work, we
propose an intuitive human-agent teaching architecture in which the human can
teach an agent how to perform a task by providing demonstrations, i.e.,
examples. To have an intuitive interaction, we argue that the agent should be
able to learn incrementally from a few single examples. To allow for this, our
objective is to broaden the agent's task understanding using domain knowledge.
Then, using a learning method to enable the agent to learn efficiently from a
limited number of examples. Finally, to optimize how human can select the most
representative and less redundant examples to provide the agent with. We apply
our proposed method to the subjective task of ingredient substitution, where
the agent needs to learn how to substitute ingredients in recipes based on
human examples. We replicate human input using the Recipe1MSubs dataset. In our
experiments, the agent achieves half its task performance after only 100
examples are provided, compared to the complete training set of 50k examples.
We show that by providing examples in strategic order along with a learning
method that leverages external symbolic knowledge, the agent can generalize
more efficiently.

*Nikolaos Kondylidis,Anil Yaman,Frank van Harmelen,Erman Acar,Annette ten Teije*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether successful coordination through communication necessarily implies mutual understanding, finding that agents can develop 'successful misunderstandings' where they coordinate effectively but interpret signals differently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that successful coordination through communication implies mutual understanding, particularly in populations with diverse perceptions like hybrid human-AI systems.

Method: Used a signaling game where agents develop new vocabulary without observing each other's signal usage, only seeing communication signals and interaction outcomes.

Result: Populations converged to optimal coordination but sometimes with misaligned interpretations (successful misunderstandings). Shared interpretations only emerged with at least 3 agents interacting with each other.

Conclusion: Successful coordination doesn't guarantee shared understanding. Minimum conditions for shared interpretations are at least 3 agents with full interaction, enabling emergent compensation for lack of shared signal observations.

Abstract: The main approach to evaluating communication is by assessing how well it
facilitates coordination. If two or more individuals can coordinate through
communication, it is generally assumed that they understand one another. We
investigate this assumption in a signaling game where individuals develop a new
vocabulary of signals to coordinate successfully. In our game, the individuals
do not have common observations besides the communication signal and outcome of
the interaction, i.e. received reward. This setting is used as a proxy to study
communication emergence in populations of agents that perceive their
environment very differently, e.g. hybrid populations that include humans and
artificial agents. Agents develop signals, use them, and refine interpretations
while not observing how other agents are using them. While populations always
converge to optimal levels of coordination, in some cases, interacting agents
interpret and use signals differently, converging to what we call successful
misunderstandings. However, agents of population that coordinate using
misaligned interpretations, are unable to establish successful coordination
with new interaction partners. Not leading to coordination failure immediately,
successful misunderstandings are difficult to spot and repair. Having at least
three agents that all interact with each other are the two minimum conditions
to ensure the emergence of shared interpretations. Under these conditions, the
agent population exhibits this emergent property of compensating for the lack
of shared observations of signal use, ensuring the emergence of shared
interpretations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LRMs can detect their capability boundaries through reasoning confidence patterns and hidden states, enabling boundary-aware strategies that cut unproductive reasoning by up to 93.6% without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LRMs waste computation on unsolvable problems by engaging in unproductive reasoning until context limit, highlighting the need for self-awareness of capability boundaries.

Method: Two monitoring approaches: reasoning expression monitoring (tracking confidence trajectories) for black-box models, and hidden states monitoring (analyzing linear separability) for white-box models.

Result: Boundary-aware strategies significantly improve reliability and efficiency, reducing token usage by 62.7-93.6% while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: LRMs possess inherent capability boundary awareness that can be leveraged to optimize reasoning efficiency and reliability through simple monitoring strategies.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that
expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs
often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong
answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a
fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship
between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we
investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We
begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through
expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning
expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence
trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for
unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last
input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems
linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we
propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression
monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these
boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without
sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by
cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogicAgent is a semiotic-square-guided framework that addresses both logical and semantic complexity in LLM reasoning, using multi-perspective FOL deduction with existential import checks and three-valued logic. It achieves SOTA performance on the new RepublicQA benchmark and generalizes well to other logical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook the interplay between logical complexity and semantic complexity, struggling with abstract propositions, ambiguous contexts, and conflicting stances that are central to human reasoning.

Method: LogicAgent performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic with existential import checks using a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain). It's guided by semiotic squares to handle semantic complexity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on RepublicQA with 6.25% average gain over baselines, and generalizes effectively to other benchmarks (ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, ProverQA) with additional 7.05% average gain.

Conclusion: The semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning approach effectively boosts LLMs' logical performance, demonstrating strong effectiveness in handling both logical and semantic complexity.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between
logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle
to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous
contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For
this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to
jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent
explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL),
while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that
incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle
boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic
simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce
RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94)
and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior
benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring
abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory
relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical
reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art
performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and
generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including
ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05%
average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our
semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical
performance.

It includes 23K+ samples and enables training of TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model that shows strong generalization and outperforms GPT-4.1 on key tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal time series datasets lack genuine reasoning depth, with most limited to surface alignment and basic question answering. The absence of well-defined reasoning tasks and high-quality data has hindered development of practical time series reasoning models.

Method: Introduces TSR-Suite with four atomic tasks covering perception (scenario understanding, causality discovery), extrapolation (event-aware forecasting), and decision-making. Uses human-guided hierarchical annotation for 2.3K samples. Trains TimeOmni-1 with multi-stage training, mixture of task scenarios, novel reward functions, and tailored optimizations.

Result: TimeOmni-1 achieves strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks with high valid response rates. It significantly improves causality discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and increases valid response rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on event-aware forecasting.

Conclusion: TSR-Suite successfully addresses the gap in time series reasoning by providing comprehensive evaluation framework and data pipeline. TimeOmni-1 demonstrates the effectiveness of unified reasoning models for diverse real-world time series problems, outperforming existing approaches like GPT-4.1.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm
shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series
understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets
mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without
reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response
rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Query circuits trace information flow for specific inputs to explain model outputs, using a new faithfulness metric and efficient discovery methods to find sparse circuits that recover much of model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods explain global model capabilities but not why specific inputs produce particular outputs. Local, input-level explanations are needed to understand model decision-making for individual queries.

Method: Introduces query circuits that trace information flow within the model itself, uses Normalized Deviation Faithfulness (NDF) metric to evaluate circuit quality, and develops sampling-based methods to efficiently discover sparse circuits.

Result: Found extremely sparse query circuits covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of performance on MMLU questions. Circuits work across benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, ARC).

Conclusion: Query circuits provide faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process individual inputs, representing a step forward in model interpretability.

Abstract: Explaining why a language model produces a particular output requires local,
input-level explanations. Existing methods uncover global capability circuits
(e.g., indirect object identification), but not why the model answers a
specific input query in a particular way. We introduce query circuits, which
directly trace the information flow inside a model that maps a specific input
to the output. Unlike surrogate-based approaches (e.g., sparse autoencoders),
query circuits are identified within the model itself, resulting in more
faithful and computationally accessible explanations. To make query circuits
practical, we address two challenges. First, we introduce Normalized Deviation
Faithfulness (NDF), a robust metric to evaluate how well a discovered circuit
recovers the model's decision for a specific input, and is broadly applicable
to circuit discovery beyond our setting. Second, we develop sampling-based
methods to efficiently identify circuits that are sparse yet faithfully
describe the model's behavior. Across benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, and
ARC), we find that there exist extremely sparse query circuits within the model
that can recover much of its performance on single queries. For example, a
circuit covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of
performance on an MMLU questions. Overall, query circuits provide a step
towards faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process
individual inputs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI) to measure logical reasoning complexity in training data, and proposes a re-cognizing optimization strategy to enhance data reasoning potential rather than just increasing data volume.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM training approaches focus on data format transformation but neglect internal reasoning complexity, leaving reasoning potential underutilized. The authors argue that LLM reasoning performance is constrained by both training data potential and model cognitive capacity.

Method: Introduced Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI) metric to quantify logical reasoning complexity by decomposing and aggregating logical structures. Proposed a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances logical reasoning intensity of existing training data to better align with LLM's reasoning boundary.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant performance and generalization improvements over data-centric strategies. The method was also validated under reinforcement learning framework.

Conclusion: Prioritizing reasoning complexity in data rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs' full cognitive potential.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of
training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However,
most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting
the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning
potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that
LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of
the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this
relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel
metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by
decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze
how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify
performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we
introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the
logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data
volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's
logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric
strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning
framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data
rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'
full cognitive potential.

TL;DR: PhysicsMinions is a coevolutionary multi-agent system that achieves state-of-the-art performance on Physics Olympiad problems by combining visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and iterative verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics Olympiads represent the pinnacle of physical intelligence testing but remain underexplored in AI research, with existing single-model approaches failing to reach gold-medal-level performance.

Method: A three-studio architecture: Visual Studio for diagram interpretation, Logic Studio for solution formulation, and Review Studio for dual-stage verification, connected through an iterative refinement loop that enables self-correction.

Result: Achieved historic breakthroughs: elevated open-source models from 1-2 to 6 gold medals across 7 Olympiads, first-ever open-source gold medal in IPhO, and reached 4th place ranking among 406 contestants with 26.8/30 points.

Conclusion: PhysicsMinions provides a generalizable framework for Olympiad-level problem solving that can potentially extend across disciplines, demonstrating strong generalization and scaling to human expert performance.

Abstract: Physics is central to understanding and shaping the real world, and the
ability to solve physics problems is a key indicator of real-world physical
intelligence. Physics Olympiads, renowned as the crown of competitive physics,
provide a rigorous testbed requiring complex reasoning and deep multimodal
understanding, yet they remain largely underexplored in AI research. Existing
approaches are predominantly single-model based, and open-source MLLMs rarely
reach gold-medal-level performance. To address this gap, we propose
PhysicsMinions, a coevolutionary multi-agent system for Physics Olympiad. Its
architecture features three synergistic studios: a Visual Studio to interpret
diagrams, a Logic Studio to formulate solutions, and a Review Studio to perform
dual-stage verification. The system coevolves through an iterative refinement
loop where feedback from the Review Studio continuously guides the Logic
Studio, enabling the system to self-correct and converge towards the ground
truth. Evaluated on the HiPhO benchmark spanning 7 latest physics Olympiads,
PhysicsMinions delivers three major breakthroughs: (i) Strong generalization:
it consistently improves both open-source and closed-source models of different
sizes, delivering clear benefits over their single-model baselines; (ii)
Historic breakthroughs: it elevates open-source models from only 1-2 to 6 gold
medals across 7 Olympiads, achieving the first-ever open-source gold medal in
the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) under the average-score
metric; and (iii) Scaling to human expert: it further advances the open-source
Pass@32 score to 26.8/30 points on the latest IPhO, ranking 4th of 406
contestants and far surpassing the top single-model score of 22.7 (ranked
22nd). Generally, PhysicsMinions offers a generalizable framework for
Olympiad-level problem solving, with the potential to extend across
disciplines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A systematic review of 270 studies on the social science of large language models (LLMs) using computational methods to create a taxonomy with three domains: LLM as Social Minds, LLM Societies, and LLM-Human Interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how LLMs evoke mind attributions, interact with each other, and transform human activity and institutions, addressing the fragmented nature of the field.

Method: Systematic review of 270 studies using text embeddings, unsupervised clustering, and topic modeling to build a computational taxonomy.

Result: Three domains emerged: LLM as Social Minds (cognition, morality, bias), LLM Societies (multi-agent coordination, norms, institutions), and LLM-Human Interactions (tasks, learning, trust, work, governance).

Conclusion: The taxonomy provides a reproducible map of the field, clarifies evidentiary standards, and highlights opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of AI.

Abstract: The social science of large language models (LLMs) examines how these systems
evoke mind attributions, interact with one another, and transform human
activity and institutions. We conducted a systematic review of 270 studies,
combining text embeddings, unsupervised clustering and topic modeling to build
a computational taxonomy. Three domains emerge organically across the reviewed
literature. LLM as Social Minds examines whether and when models display
behaviors that elicit attributions of cognition, morality and bias, while
addressing challenges such as test leakage and surface cues. LLM Societies
examines multi-agent settings where interaction protocols, architectures and
mechanism design shape coordination, norms, institutions and collective
epistemic processes. LLM-Human Interactions examines how LLMs reshape tasks,
learning, trust, work and governance, and how risks arise at the human-AI
interface. This taxonomy provides a reproducible map of a fragmented field,
clarifies evidentiary standards across levels of analysis, and highlights
opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of artificial
intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RealUnify is a benchmark designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy between visual understanding and generation in unified multimodal models, revealing that current models struggle with effective integration despite architectural unification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks assess understanding and generation capabilities in isolation, failing to determine whether unified models can leverage synergetic interactions between these capabilities for mutual enhancement.

Method: RealUnify comprises 1,000 human-annotated instances across 10 categories and 32 subtasks, structured around two axes: Understanding Enhances Generation (reasoning-guided image generation) and Generation Enhances Understanding (mental simulation for reasoning tasks). It uses a dual-evaluation protocol with end-to-end assessment and diagnostic stepwise evaluation.

Result: Large-scale evaluations of 12 unified models and 6 specialized baselines show that current unified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy between understanding and generation capabilities.

Conclusion: Architectural unification alone is insufficient for achieving capability synergy, highlighting the need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock the potential of unified modeling.

Abstract: The integration of visual understanding and generation into unified
multimodal models represents a significant stride toward general-purpose AI.
However, a fundamental question remains unanswered by existing benchmarks: does
this architectural unification actually enable synergetic interaction between
the constituent capabilities? Existing evaluation paradigms, which primarily
assess understanding and generation in isolation, are insufficient for
determining whether a unified model can leverage its understanding to enhance
its generation, or use generative simulation to facilitate deeper
comprehension. To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy.
RealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10
categories and 32 subtasks. It is structured around two core axes: 1)
Understanding Enhances Generation, which requires reasoning (e.g., commonsense,
logic) to guide image generation, and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding,
which necessitates mental simulation or reconstruction (e.g., of transformed or
disordered visual inputs) to solve reasoning tasks. A key contribution is our
dual-evaluation protocol, which combines direct end-to-end assessment with a
diagnostic stepwise evaluation that decomposes tasks into distinct
understanding and generation phases. This protocol allows us to precisely
discern whether performance bottlenecks stem from deficiencies in core
abilities or from a failure to integrate them. Through large-scale evaluations
of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines, we find that current
unified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy, indicating that
architectural unification alone is insufficient. These results highlight the
need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock the
potential of unified modeling.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SQuID enables neural embeddings to recover latent psychometric dimensions from survey items, achieving 55% variance explained in dimension similarities compared to human data without domain-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a cost-effective, scalable alternative to traditional human surveys for psychometric measurement that maintains comparable quality while offering greater flexibility.

Method: Uses SQuID approach with large language model embeddings to process Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire items, comparing multiple embedding models across evaluation metrics without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Embeddings explain 55% of variance in dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data, with fair factor congruence coefficients and alignment with underlying theory in multidimensional scaling configurations.

Conclusion: Semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric structures from human surveys, offering substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods.

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings
Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural
network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric
survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language
models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values
obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire
(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across
a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully
addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions
without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals
that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in
dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional
scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence
coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results
demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric
structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach
offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while
maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have
significant implications for psychometrics and social science research,
providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human
behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

TL;DR: A Bayesian meta-learning framework that automatically converts normative theories into probabilistic models using adaptive deep kernel Gaussian processes, improving data fitting and theory validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between normative theories and data-driven approaches by creating an automated method to incorporate theoretical knowledge into probabilistic models for better biological data analysis.

Method: Meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from normative theories using adaptive deep kernel Gaussian processes, creating Theory-Informed Kernels for probabilistic modeling.

Result: Improved response prediction accuracy in mouse retinal ganglion cells, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, interpretable representations, and accurate theory-match inference through Bayesian model selection.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, automated approach for integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry, successfully demonstrated in neuroscience applications.

Abstract: Normative and task-driven theories offer powerful top-down explanations for
biological systems, yet the goals of quantitatively arbitrating between
competing theories, and utilizing them as inductive biases to improve
data-driven fits of real biological datasets are prohibitively laborious, and
often impossible. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian meta-learning framework
designed to automatically convert raw functional predictions from normative
theories into tractable probabilistic models. We employ adaptive deep kernel
Gaussian processes, meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from a
normative theory. This Theory-Informed Kernel specifies a probabilistic model
representing the theory predictions -- usable for both fitting data and
rigorously validating the theory. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to
the early visual system, using efficient coding as our normative theory. We
show improved response prediction accuracy in ex vivo recordings of mouse
retinal ganglion cells stimulated by natural scenes compared to conventional
data-driven baselines, while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates
and interpretable representations. Using exact Bayesian model selection, we
also show that our informed kernel can accurately infer the degree of
theory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure.
This work provides a more general, scalable, and automated approach for
integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry in
neuroscience and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current legal benchmarks don't account for MAS advantages like task decomposition and agent specialization, limiting MAS potential in legal domain.

Method: Proposed MASLegalBench with GDPR scenarios, manually designed role-based MAS, and conducted experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: Results reveal strengths, limitations, and improvement areas for existing models and MAS architectures in legal reasoning.

Conclusion: MASLegalBench enables better evaluation of multi-agent systems in legal domain, highlighting their potential for complex legal tasks.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In
this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While
previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are
specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task
decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack
of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To
address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS
and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as
the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and
covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies
of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various
role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and
potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in single-agent perception systems (distant object sensing and occlusion) and investigate the types and causes of errors in V2X cooperative perception systems, which are complex software systems with diverse components.

Method: Conducted systematic evaluation of V2X cooperative perception systems through large-scale empirical study, analyzing six prevalent error patterns and assessing critical components including different sensor types, fusion schemes, and communication conditions.

Result: Key findings: (1) LiDAR-based cooperation has highest perception performance; (2) V2I and V2V communication show distinct performance under different fusion schemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors lead to more driving violations; (4) Systems are not robust against communication interference in online operation.

Conclusion: The study reveals potential risks and vulnerabilities in cooperative perception systems, providing insights to promote better design and repair of these critical systems.

Abstract: With the tremendous advancement of deep learning and communication
technology, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception has the
potential to address limitations in sensing distant objects and occlusion for a
single-agent perception system. V2X cooperative perception systems are software
systems characterized by diverse sensor types and cooperative agents, varying
fusion schemes, and operation under different communication conditions.
Therefore, their complex composition gives rise to numerous operational
challenges. Furthermore, when cooperative perception systems produce erroneous
predictions, the types of errors and their underlying causes remain
insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step by
conducting an empirical study of V2X cooperative perception. To systematically
evaluate the impact of cooperative perception on the ego vehicle's perception
performance, we identify and analyze six prevalent error patterns in
cooperative perception systems. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of
the critical components of these systems through our large-scale study and
identify the following key findings: (1) The LiDAR-based cooperation
configuration exhibits the highest perception performance; (2)
Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
exhibit distinct cooperative perception performance under different fusion
schemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors may result in a higher
frequency of driving violations; (4) Cooperative perception systems are not
robust against communication interference when running online. Our results
reveal potential risks and vulnerabilities in critical components of
cooperative perception systems. We hope that our findings can better promote
the design and repair of cooperative perception systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fully automate the scientific discovery process by enabling free-form exploration of unknown systems without tailoring approaches to specific tasks, addressing the challenge of automating the open-ended, iterative loop of observation, analysis, and hypothesis generation.

Method: Leverages large language model tool-use capabilities with a minimal set of tools (primarily code execution) to explore physical systems, allowing the agent to conduct experiments and analyze results without domain-specific blueprints.

Result: Impressive performance on recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values across mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effective scientific exploration without finetuning or task-specific instructions, opening doors for similar automated discovery in other domains.

Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations,
analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being
adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an
open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop
required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through
experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a
given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large
language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems
without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of
physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer
on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution,
and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily
based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as
recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring
Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this
setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains,
without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

TL;DR: CLPO introduces a curriculum-guided learning approach for RLVR that dynamically assesses problem difficulty and adapts training based on model capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods treat all training samples uniformly, ignoring differences in problem difficulty relative to model capabilities, leading to inefficient exploration and limited performance.

Method: CLPO creates a dynamic pedagogical feedback loop using real-time difficulty assessment to build an Online Curriculum, guiding Adaptive Problem Restructuring where the model diversifies medium problems and simplifies challenging ones.

Result: CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks with average pass@1 improvement of 6.96% over other methods.

Conclusion: The approach transforms static training into dynamic co-evolution with model capabilities, demonstrating potential for more efficient training of reasoning models.

Abstract: Recently, online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has
become a key paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods typically treat all training
samples uniformly, overlooking the vast differences in problem difficulty
relative to the model's current capabilities. This uniform training strategy
leads to inefficient exploration of problems the model has already mastered,
while concurrently lacking effective guidance on problems that are challenging
its abilities the most, limiting both learning efficiency and upper-bound
performance. To address this, we propose CLPO (Curriculum-guided Learning for
Policy Optimization), a novel algorithm that creates a dynamic pedagogical
feedback loop within the policy optimization process. The core of CLPO
leverages the model's own rollout performance to conduct real-time difficulty
assessment, thereby constructing an Online Curriculum. This curriculum then
guides an Adaptive Problem Restructuring mechanism, where the model acts as its
own teacher: it diversifies medium-difficulty problems to promote
generalization and simplifies challenging problems to make them more
attainable. Our approach transforms the static training procedure into a
dynamic process that co-evolves with the model's capabilities. Experiments show
that CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight challenging
mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, with an average pass@1
improvement of 6.96% over other methods, demonstrating its potential for more
efficiently training more capable reasoning models.

TL;DR: AutoPlay is a scalable pipeline for generating diverse, executable tasks to train multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as interactive agents, reducing reliance on human annotation by systematically exploring environments and synthesizing grounded tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of high-quality, diverse, and verifiable downstream agentic task datasets limits scaling post-training of MLLMs for interactive applications like computer-use, web navigation, and robotics. Existing methods are either costly (human annotation) or yield limited coverage (prompting MLLMs).

Method: AutoPlay operates in two stages: (1) Exploration phase where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment states and functionalities, and (2) Task generation phase where a task generator uses exploration trajectories and task guideline prompts to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks.

Result: AutoPlay generated 20k tasks across 20 Android apps and 10k tasks across 13 Ubuntu applications. This enabled training MLLM-based UI agents that improved success rates by up to 20.0% on mobile-use and 10.9% on computer-use scenarios. Combined with reinforcement learning, it achieved an additional 5.7% gain.

Conclusion: AutoPlay establishes a scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents, significantly reducing reliance on human annotation while enabling large-scale task demonstration synthesis and improved agent performance across mobile and computer-use scenarios.

Abstract: Post-Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to build interactive
agents holds promise across domains such as computer-use, web navigation, and
robotics. A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality
downstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and
verifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human
annotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information,
which is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited
coverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task
generation that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover
possible interactions and current state information to synthesize
environment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration
phase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment
states and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task
generator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline
prompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks. We
show AutoPlay generates 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks
across 13 applications Ubuntu applications to train mobile-use and computer-use
agents. AutoPlay generated tasks enable large-scale task demonstration
synthesis without human annotation by employing an MLLM task executor and
verifier. This data enables training MLLM-based UI agents that improve success
rates up to $20.0\%$ on mobile-use and $10.9\%$ on computer-use scenarios. In
addition, AutoPlay generated tasks combined with MLLM verifier-based rewards
enable scaling reinforcement learning training of UI agents, leading to an
additional $5.7\%$ gain. coverage. These results establish AutoPlay as a
scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents reducing reliance on
human annotation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create more interpretable and general artificial agents that learn through explicit reasoning rather than opaque neural network weights, building transparent world models from raw experience.

Method: Uses LLM-based agent architecture with iterative interaction and reflection cycles. After each episode, performs Rule Induction to learn environment dynamics and Strategy/Playbook Summarization to distill experiences into actionable strategies.

Result: Successfully masters diverse grid-world tasks (Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, Sokoban) by autonomously discovering rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies confirm iterative process is critical.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that build transparent world models through explicit reasoning, offering an alternative to traditional deep reinforcement learning approaches.

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex
environments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement
learning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge
opaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in
which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito,
ergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language
Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its
environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state
with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of
interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete
trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where
it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and
Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable
strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,
Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent
successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their
rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies
confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work
demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only
act effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world
through explicit reasoning on raw experience.

Abstract: Heatwaves pose complex cascading risks across interconnected climate, social,

hinders comprehensive understanding of these risk pathways. We introduce HeDA
(Heatwave Discovery Agent), an intelligent multi-agent system designed for

successfully discovered five previously unidentified high-impact risk chains,
such as the pathway where a heatwave leads to a water demand surge, resulting
in industrial water restrictions and ultimately causing small business

TL;DR: RL enables LLMs to acquire genuinely new compositional skills by combining existing atomic skills, not just reweighting existing knowledge. This compositional ability generalizes to unseen function combinations and transfers across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the debate about whether RL teaches LLMs genuinely new skills or merely activates existing ones, by providing concrete evidence of new skill acquisition through composition.

Method: Developed a synthetic framework using string transformation functions, testing whether LLMs can learn unseen compositions h(x)=g(f(x)) when they already know f and g individually. Used RL training and compared with next-token training.

Result: RL enabled LLMs to learn unseen function compositions, generalize to compositions of >2 functions, and transfer compositional skills to different tasks without target-specific compositional training. RL fundamentally changed reasoning behaviors, while next-token training showed none of these effects.

Conclusion: RL can teach LLMs genuinely new compositional skills that generalize and transfer, suggesting a strategy of building base models with basic skills then using RL for advanced, generalizable problem-solving abilities.

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing
ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in
LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with
RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue
that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.
This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills
during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms
by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination
and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task
complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.
Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string
transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g
prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen
compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability
generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions
unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that
compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target
task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,
requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative
analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the
models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of
these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM
learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,
then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex
problems.

TL;DR: RLHI learns from natural human conversations instead of pre-annotated feedback, using two methods: User-Guided Rewrites and User-Based Rewards with persona conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational models rely on pre-annotated expert feedback, which limits scalability and natural alignment. Learning directly from real user interactions enables more organic and scalable model improvement.

Method: Two complementary RLHI methods: (1) User-Guided Rewrites that revise unsatisfactory outputs based on user follow-up responses, (2) User-Based Rewards that learn via persona-conditioned reward models using long-term interaction history.

Result: Both RLHI variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and instruction-following on WildChat conversations. Similar feedback also improves reasoning benchmark performance.

Conclusion: Organic human interaction provides scalable and effective supervision for personalized alignment, suggesting natural conversations can replace pre-annotated feedback for continual model improvement.

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted
alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current
conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human
feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human
Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user
conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided
Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'
natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which
learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term
interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term
user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference
optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI
variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and
instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning
benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable,
effective supervision for personalized alignment.

*Yue Zhang,Tianyi Ma,Zun Wang,Yanyuan Qiao,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

TL;DR: Improving VLN agents by using multi-perspective textual descriptions for analogical reasoning across images, enhancing contextual understanding and navigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based VLN agents either oversimplify visual details with textual scene descriptions or fail to capture abstract semantics with raw image inputs, limiting their contextual understanding.

Method: Incorporating textual descriptions from multiple perspectives to facilitate analogical reasoning across images, enhancing global scene understanding and spatial reasoning.

Result: Significant improvements in navigation performance demonstrated on the R2R dataset.

Conclusion: Multi-perspective textual descriptions with analogical reasoning effectively enhance VLN agents' contextual understanding and navigation capabilities.

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming
increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual
scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw
image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for
high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's
contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple
perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging
text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene
understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.
We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in navigation performance.

TL;DR: ReasoningBank is a memory framework that enables LLM agents to learn from past experiences by distilling reasoning strategies from successful and failed interactions, improving performance over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents fail to learn from accumulated interaction history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors in persistent real-world roles.

Method: Proposes ReasoningBank framework that distills generalizable reasoning strategies from self-judged successful/failed experiences, with memory retrieval at test time and integration of new learnings. Introduces memory-aware test-time scaling (MaTTS) to accelerate learning by scaling up interaction experience.

Result: Outperforms existing memory mechanisms across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks, improving both effectiveness and efficiency. MaTTS further amplifies these gains.

Conclusion: Establishes memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arising.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent
real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key
limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction
history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We
propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from
ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,
enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful
experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling
(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up
the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,
the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive
signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn
guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory
and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,
ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store
raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness
and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish
memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to
self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with simple visual reasoning tasks due to limitations in visually-grounded serial processing, unlike humans who excel at such tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why VLMs fail on simple visual reasoning tasks despite success on benchmarks, and test if serial processing deficits are the key factor.

Method: Compared human and VLM performance across geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation tasks with varying serial processing demands.

Result: VLM accuracy decreased as human reaction time increased, showing a strong correlation between serial processing load and the VLM-human performance gap.

Conclusion: Limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning are a fundamental bottleneck distinguishing current VLMs from human performance.

Abstract: Why do Vision Language Models (VLMs), despite success on standard benchmarks,
often fail to match human performance on surprisingly simple visual reasoning
tasks? While the underlying computational principles are still debated, we
hypothesize that a crucial factor is a deficit in visually-grounded serial
processing. To test this hypothesis, we compared human and VLM performance
across tasks designed to vary serial processing demands in three distinct
domains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation.
Tasks within each domain varied serial processing load by manipulating factors
such as geometric concept complexity, perceptual individuation load, and
transformation difficulty. Across all domains, our results revealed a
consistent pattern: decreased VLM accuracy was strongly correlated with
increased human reaction time (used as a proxy for serial processing load). As
tasks require more demanding serial processing -- whether composing concepts,
enumerating items, or performing mental transformations -- the VLM-human
performance gap widens reliably. These findings support our hypothesis,
indicating that limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a
fundamental bottleneck that distinguishes current VLMs from humans.

### [680] [UniAPL: A Unified Adversarial Preference Learning Framework for Instruct-Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25148)
*FaQiang Qian,WeiKun Zhang,Ziliang Wang,Kang An,Xuhui Zheng,Liangjian Wen,Mengya Gao,Yong Dai,Yichao Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniAPL is a unified adversarial preference learning framework that addresses distributional mismatch in LLM alignment by jointly learning from both supervised fine-tuning and preference data in a single-stage training process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard sequential alignment pipeline (SFT followed by RL) suffers from distributional mismatch where SFT uses static expert data but policy distribution drifts during RL, making SFT knowledge brittle and RL updates inefficient.

Method: Reframe alignment as constrained optimization and propose UniAPL - a single-stage unified training objective that learns from mixed batches of SFT and preference data, using dense expert demonstrations to ground and regularize online exploration.

Result: UniAPL matches or exceeds strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on Qwen3-0.6B (matching 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B, even outperforming the teacher model. Response analysis confirms outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations.

Conclusion: UniAPL inherently resolves distributional mismatch and maximizes data synergy, achieving both stronger performance and better behavioral alignment by dynamically aligning policy distribution with expert demonstrations.

Abstract: Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment.
We argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference
Learning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g.,
Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement
Learning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due
to a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the
policy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge
brittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich,
ground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient,
ungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data
sources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization
problem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel
framework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's.
UniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning
from mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense
expert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration,
inherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We
evaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507
as the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on
Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the
teacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirm
that UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving both
stronger performance and better behavioral alignment.

TL;DR: The paper proposes J-Detector, a method to detect LLM-generated judgments by analyzing the interaction between judgment scores and candidate content, addressing biases in LLM-based evaluation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based judgments are increasingly used but suffer from inherent biases and vulnerabilities, creating urgent need for detection methods in sensitive applications like academic peer reviewing.

Method: J-Detector is a lightweight neural detector that uses explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM judges' biases with candidates' properties for detection, focusing on judgment scores and candidate content interaction.

Result: Experiments show J-Detector effectively detects LLM-generated judgments across diverse datasets and enables quantification of biases in LLM judges through interpretability analysis.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates practical utility of judgment detection in real-world scenarios and analyzes key factors affecting detectability of LLM-generated judgments.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based judgments leverage powerful LLMs to
efficiently evaluate candidate content and provide judgment scores. However,
the inherent biases and vulnerabilities of LLM-generated judgments raise
concerns, underscoring the urgent need for distinguishing them in sensitive
scenarios like academic peer reviewing. In this work, we propose and formalize
the task of judgment detection and systematically investigate the detectability
of LLM-generated judgments. Unlike LLM-generated text detection, judgment
detection relies solely on judgment scores and candidates, reflecting
real-world scenarios where textual feedback is often unavailable in the
detection process. Our preliminary analysis shows that existing LLM-generated
text detection methods perform poorly given their incapability to capture the
interaction between judgment scores and candidate content -- an aspect crucial
for effective judgment detection. Inspired by this, we introduce
\textit{J-Detector}, a lightweight and transparent neural detector augmented
with explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM
judges' biases with candidates' properties for accurate detection. Experiments
across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{J-Detector}
and show how its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges.
Finally, we analyze key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated
judgments and validate the practical utility of judgment detection in
real-world scenarios.
