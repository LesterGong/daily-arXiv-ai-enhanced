### [1] [LVTINO: LAtent Video consisTency INverse sOlver for High Definition Video Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01339)
*Alessio Spagnoletti,Andrés Almansa,Marcelo Pereyra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVTINO is a zero-shot video restoration method that uses Video Consistency Models (VCMs) instead of frame-by-frame image diffusion models to achieve temporal consistency and high-quality reconstruction with computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-based diffusion models applied frame-by-frame for video restoration result in temporal inconsistencies, creating a need for methods that can capture temporal dependencies while maintaining spatial detail.

Method: Leverages Video Consistency Models (VCMs) that distill video latent diffusion models into fast generators capturing temporal causality, with a conditioning mechanism that bypasses automatic differentiation and requires few neural function evaluations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality with strong measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions, showing significant perceptual improvements over frame-by-frame image LDM methods.

Conclusion: LVTINO establishes a new benchmark in both reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency for zero-shot video inverse problems, demonstrating the superiority of video-specific priors over image-based approaches.

Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative
diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular,
state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled
text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy
and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending
these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant
challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing
subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply
image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally
inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent
advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent
diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal
causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot
or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with
priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for
automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction
quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong
measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.
Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show
significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that
apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both
reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

### [2] [Image Generation Based on Image Style Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01347)
*Shuochen Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for fine-grained stylized image generation using style extraction from reference images, aligned with text conditions through a three-stage training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained styles cannot be precisely controlled with natural language alone, and stylized reference images are difficult to align with traditional text-guided generation.

Method: Three-stage training method using a style encoder and style projection layer to extract style representations from reference images and align them with text representations.

Result: Proposed method enables fine-grained controlled stylized image generation by injecting style representations into the generative model without changing its structure.

Conclusion: The approach successfully achieves fine-grained style control in image generation by extracting and aligning style representations with text conditions.

Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with
practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely
described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of
stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual
conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on
how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model,
by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given
stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the
generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream
generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image
generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style
extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a
style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual
representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide
generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset,
whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions,
to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.

### [3] [EvoStruggle: A Dataset Capturing the Evolution of Struggle across Activities and Skill Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01362)
*Shijia Feng,Michael Wray,Walterio Mayol-Cuevas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dataset for detecting struggle during skill acquisition, collected from 76 participants performing 18 tasks across 4 activities. The dataset includes 61.68 hours of video with 5,385 annotated struggle segments, and uses Temporal Action Localization models to identify struggle with transferability across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how struggle evolves during skill acquisition is crucial for optimizing human learning and developing assistive systems, but existing datasets haven't focused on struggle evolution over time.

Method: Collected a large dataset with 61.68 hours of video from 76 participants performing 18 tasks across 4 activities (tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, shuffling cards), with participants repeating tasks 5 times to capture skill evolution. Used Temporal Action Localization models to identify and localize struggle segments.

Result: Temporal Action Localization models successfully learned to detect struggle cues, achieving 34.56% average mAP when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across activities, showing struggle is a transferable concept across skill-based tasks.

Conclusion: Struggle can be detected and localized using temporal action localization models, and the concept transfers across different tasks and activities, though there's room for improvement in detection performance.

Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is
crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of
effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of
struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to
determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing
manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In
this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68
hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle
segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped
into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and
shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,
participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of
skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action
localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle
segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal
Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even
when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall
average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across
activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various
skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in
struggle detection. Our dataset is available at

*Abu Bucker Siddik,Diane Oyen,Alexander Most,Michal Kucer,Ayan Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPUS is a compact foundation model using lightweight residual U-Net architecture for solving diverse PDEs, achieving SOTA generalization with fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PDE foundation models rely on large transformer architectures with high computational overhead, while U-Net architectures remain underexplored as foundation models in this domain despite their potential efficiency.

Method: Leverages lightweight residual U-Net architecture with auto-regressive pretraining strategy that replicates numerical solver behavior to learn underlying physics. Pretrained on diverse fluid dynamics PDEs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art generalization on 6 challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems, while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: SPUS demonstrates potential as a highly parameter-efficient foundation model for solving diverse PDE systems, offering compact and efficient alternative to large transformer-based models.

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient
foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide
range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing
state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer
architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a
lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely
underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable
effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet
powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the
behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is
pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6
challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based
architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks
while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data,
highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving
diverse PDE systems.

### [5] [DisCo: Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints for Multi-Human Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01399)
*Shubhankar Borse,Farzad Farhadzadeh,Munawar Hayat,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCo is an RL-based framework that optimizes identity diversity in multi-human image generation, addressing issues like face duplication and identity merging in text-to-image models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with multi-human prompts, duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting individuals, creating an 'identity crisis' in generative models.

Method: DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models using Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that penalizes facial similarity, discourages identity repetition, enforces accurate person counts, and preserves visual fidelity through human preference scores.

Result: On the DiverseHumans Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6% Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global Identity Spread, surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods while maintaining competitive perceptual quality.

Conclusion: DisCo establishes a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves the identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark for compositional multi-human generation.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on
multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting
individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the
first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human
generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image
facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii)
enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through
human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as
complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans
Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global
Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g.,
Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our
results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves
the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark
for compositional multi-human generation.

### [6] [GeoSURGE: Geo-localization using Semantic Fusion with Hierarchy of Geographic Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01448)
*Angel Daruna,Nicholas Meegan,Han-Pang Chiu,Supun Samarasekera,Rakesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel approach for worldwide visual geo-localization by aligning visual representations with hierarchical geographic embeddings and fusing appearance features with semantic segmentation maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve visual geo-localization by developing better learned representations of geography that can accurately determine geographic locations from images anywhere on Earth.

Method: Formulates geo-localization as aligning visual representations with learned geographic representations, models the world as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings, and fuses appearance features with semantic segmentation maps.

Result: Achieved improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models.

Conclusion: The performance gains are primarily driven by the combination of geographic and visual representations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical geographic embedding approach.

Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location
of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned
representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active
research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning
the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic
representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world
as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach
to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its
semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main
experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics
measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional
ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the
combination of geographic and visual representations.

### [7] [Data Selection for Fine-tuning Vision Language Models via Cross Modal Alignment Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01454)
*Nilay Naharas,Dang Nguyen,Nesihan Bulut,Mohammadhossein Bateni,Vahab Mirrokni,Baharan Mirzasoleiman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XMAS is the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) that clusters examples based on cross-modal attention matrix trajectories to remove redundancy, achieving significant data reduction while preserving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data selection methods for LVLMs are underexplored, with existing methods failing to outperform random selection at different subset sizes, creating a need for principled data-efficient approaches.

Method: XMAS clusters examples based on trajectories of top singular values of cross-modal attention matrices from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM, then samples a balanced subset from these clusters to remove redundancy.

Result: XMAS discards 50% of LLaVA-665k and 85% of Vision-Flan datasets while fully preserving LLaVA-1.5-7B performance on 10 benchmarks, speeding up training by 1.2x and achieving 30% more data reduction than best baseline.

Conclusion: XMAS provides an effective framework for data-efficient LVLM training by leveraging cross-modal attention patterns to identify and eliminate redundant training examples.

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training
datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative
examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models
and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can
outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose
the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We
prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during
instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model
parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model
during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters
examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their
attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a
balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in
large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can
discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while
fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and
speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to
the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at

*Răzvan-Andrei Matişan,Vincent Tao Hu,Grigory Bartosh,Björn Ommer,Cees G. M. Snoek,Max Welling,Jan-Willem van de Meent,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Floor Eijkelboom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Purrception is a variational flow matching method for vector-quantized image generation that combines continuous transport dynamics with explicit categorical supervision over codebook indices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between continuous flow matching methods and discrete categorical approaches, enabling geometric awareness while providing explicit supervision over discrete codes.

Method: Adapts Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the continuous embedding space.

Result: Achieves faster training convergence than continuous and discrete flow matching baselines on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation, with competitive FID scores compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency in image generation.

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for
vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical
supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts
Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical
posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the
continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous
methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling
uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled
generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training
converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching
baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models.
This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge
continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency
in image generation.

### [9] [AortaDiff: A Unified Multitask Diffusion Framework For Contrast-Free AAA Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01498)
*Yuxuan Ou,Ning Bi,Jiazhen Pan,Jiancheng Yang,Boliang Yu,Usama Zidan,Regent Lee,Vicente Grau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified deep learning framework that generates synthetic contrast-enhanced CT from non-contrast CT while simultaneously segmenting aortic lumen and thrombus, outperforming single-task and multi-stage models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce risks associated with iodinated contrast agents in CT scans (nephrotoxicity, allergies, environmental harm) by generating synthetic CECT from NCCT, while overcoming limitations of multi-stage pipelines that cause error accumulation.

Method: Integrates conditional diffusion models with multi-task learning for end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical segmentation, sharing encoder/decoder parameters across tasks and using semi-supervised training for missing labels.

Result: Achieved PSNR of 25.61 dB for image synthesis (vs 23.80 dB single-task), improved lumen Dice to 0.89 (from 0.87) and thrombus Dice to 0.53 (from 0.48), reduced lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm (from 5.78 mm) and thrombus area error to 33.85% (from 41.45%).

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework effectively reduces contrast agent use while improving both image synthesis quality and anatomical segmentation accuracy for abdominal aortic aneurysm assessment.

Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic
aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,
including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce
contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating
synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a
multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs
segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared
semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep
learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while
simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach
integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,
enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical
segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires
no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder
and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training
strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common
constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of
264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task
and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61
dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,
it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus
Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to
more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm
from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to
nnU-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxuanou623/AortaDiff.git.

*Basem Rizk,Joel Walsh,Mark Core,Benjamin Nye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for efficiently prototyping multi-modal content analysis pipelines that converts videos into temporal semi-structured data and queryable knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal content analysis is computationally expensive and requires significant engineering effort. Existing pre-trained models are hard to fuse with complex data like videos.

Method: Developed a framework that combines pre-trained models to convert videos into temporal semi-structured data, then translates this to frame-level indexed knowledge graphs that are queryable and support continual learning.

Result: Created a pipeline that enables dynamic incorporation of new domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenges of multi-modal content analysis by providing an efficient prototyping approach with queryable knowledge graphs that support continual learning.

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and
require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with
pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WALT is a framework that reverse-engineers website functionality into reusable tools, shifting browser automation from fragile step-by-step interactions to reliable tool invocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agents are brittle and rely on heavy LLM reasoning that breaks under dynamic layouts and long horizons, unlike humans who use high-level operations like search and filter.

Method: WALT reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable invocable tools that abstract away low-level execution, exposing robust implementations of automations already designed into websites.

Result: On VisualWebArena and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less LLM-dependent reasoning compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: WALT establishes a robust and generalizable paradigm for browser automation by shifting computational burden from fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation.

Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods
remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM
reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by
contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations
like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools),
a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable
invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust
implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning
discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and
content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level
execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call
search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from
fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena
and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less
LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for
browser automation.

*Meilong Xu,Xiaoling Hu,Shahira Abousamra,Chen Li,Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised segmentation framework that uses topological consistency across multiple perturbed predictions to preserve meaningful structures in histopathology images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of capturing meaningful semantic structures from unlabeled data in histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed and distinguishing biological structures from noise is difficult.

Method: Leverages multiple perturbed predictions through stochastic dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency. Introduces a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap with global structural alignment to match topological features across predictions without ground truth.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the approach effectively reduces topological errors and produces more robust and accurate segmentations essential for reliable downstream analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully identifies and preserves relevant topological features in semi-supervised segmentation, particularly beneficial for histopathology image analysis where biological structures need to be distinguished from artifacts.

Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures
from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in
histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To
address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework
designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our
method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic
dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency
across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish
biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key
challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological
features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome
this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap
with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces
topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations
essential for reliable downstream analysis. Code is available at

### [13] [Towards Better Optimization For Listwise Preference in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01540)
*Jiamu Bai,Xin Yu,Meilong Xu,Weitao Lu,Xin Pan,Kiwan Maeng,Daniel Kifer,Jian Wang,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-LPO extends Direct Preference Optimization to handle listwise preferences for text-to-image diffusion models, enabling better alignment with human preferences using ranked image lists rather than just pairwise comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DPO methods for diffusion models rely on pairwise preferences, but human feedback often contains implicit ranked information that provides more precise preference data than simple pairwise comparisons.

Method: Proposes Diffusion-LPO framework that aggregates user feedback into ranked image lists and derives a listwise extension of DPO objective under the Plackett-Luce model, enforcing consistency across entire rankings by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all lower-ranked alternatives.

Result: Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms pairwise DPO baselines across text-to-image generation, image editing, and personalized preference alignment tasks, demonstrating superior visual quality and preference alignment.

Conclusion: Listwise preference optimization through Diffusion-LPO provides a more effective approach for aligning diffusion models with human preferences compared to traditional pairwise methods, leveraging richer ranked information from human feedback.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness
for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences.
Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its
computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its
applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences.
The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed.
In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked
information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise
comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective
framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with
listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list
of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the
Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire
ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked
alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO
across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and
personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms
pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

TL;DR: Bridge is a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that enables both image understanding and generation within a single next-token prediction framework using a Mixture-of-Transformers architecture and semantic-to-pixel discrete representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in building unified MLLMs that support both understanding and generation, addressing trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity in existing approaches.

Method: Augments pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through Mixture-of-Transformers architecture and semantic-to-pixel discrete representation combining compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel tokens.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation benchmarks with only 7.9% increase in sequence length, requiring less training data and reduced training time.

Conclusion: Bridge successfully demonstrates that pure autoregressive unified MLLMs can achieve strong performance in both visual understanding and generation while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language
models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified
MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing
such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous
embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality
images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive
approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but
often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In
this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments
pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a
Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and
generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve
visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete
representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel
tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual

### [15] [Robust Classification of Oral Cancer with Limited Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01547)
*Akshay Bhagwan Sonawane,Lena D. Swamikannan,Lakshman Tamil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN-Bayesian deep learning model for oral cancer classification using small datasets, achieving 94% accuracy on similar test data and superior generalizability (88% vs 72.94%) on diverse real-world data compared to traditional CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oral cancer has high mortality rates, especially in regions with limited healthcare access. Early diagnosis is challenging due to limited infrastructure and healthcare practitioners. Traditional deep learning models require large datasets and suffer from overconfidence, which is impractical in data-scarce settings.

Method: Proposed a hybrid model combining CNN with Bayesian deep learning using variational inference for uncertainty quantification. Trained on smartphone-captured photographic color images and evaluated on three distinct test datasets.

Result: Achieved 94% accuracy on similar distribution test data, comparable to traditional CNNs. Superior generalizability on diverse real-world data with 88% accuracy vs 72.94% for traditional CNNs. Model shows low uncertainty for correct classifications and high uncertainty for misclassifications.

Conclusion: Bayesian inference effectively enhances model reliability and generalizability in data-scarce environments, improving early oral cancer diagnosis by providing uncertainty quantification and better performance with limited training data.

Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a
particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.
Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist
due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage
of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while
promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced
reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate
overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with
limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that
combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for
oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs
variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty
quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by
smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method
achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of
the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for
real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations
differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior
generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%
for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed
that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly
classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified
samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in
data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving
model reliability and generalizability.

### [16] [Consistent Assistant Domains Transformer for Source-free Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01559)
*Renrong Shao,Wei Zhang,Kangyang Luo,Qin Li,and Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADTrans is a source-free domain adaptation method that constructs invariable feature representations using assistant domains and multiple consistency strategies to handle hard samples and domain bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFDA methods struggle with hard samples and domain bias because they can't access source domain data to obtain deterministic invariable features.

Method: Uses assistant domain module to get diversified representations from intermediate attentions, applies multiple consistent strategies to obtain invariable features, and employs conditional multi-kernel max mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) to align hard samples with easy samples.

Result: Extensive experiments on Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and DomainNet-126 benchmarks show significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: CADTrans effectively addresses SFDA challenges by constructing domain-consistent invariable feature representations and handling hard samples through assistant domains and consistency strategies.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of
adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly.
However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic
invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily
focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely
resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain
with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples
and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant
Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue
by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency.
Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain
diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions,
which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing
diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature
representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be
used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples
to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max
mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same
category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted
on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and
DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our
proposed approaches. Code is available at

*Ricardo Gonzalez Penuela,Felipe Arias-Russi,Victor Capriles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A system that uses historical BLV user questions to guide multimodal LLMs in generating more contextually relevant image descriptions, reducing irrelevant details and anticipating user needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM applications provide lengthy, comprehensive descriptions regardless of context, forcing BLV users to sift through irrelevant information rather than getting specific answers to their likely questions.

Method: Developed a system that identifies similar past visual contexts from VizWiz-LF dataset and uses associated BLV user questions to guide MLLM generation of context-aware descriptions.

Result: Context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users' questions in 76.1% of cases (70/92) and were preferred in 54.4% of comparisons (50/92) over context-free descriptions.

Conclusion: Using historical BLV user questions to guide MLLMs significantly improves the relevance and usefulness of image descriptions for BLV users by anticipating their information needs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual
interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because
of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations.
However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy
descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as
users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific
information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant
information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users
questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual
contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide
the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with
three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions
showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users'
questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of
comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly

### [19] [NPN: Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space for Imaging Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01608)
*Roman Jacome,Romario Gualdrón-Hurtado,Leon Suarez,Henry Arguello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space (NPN), a novel regularization method that promotes solutions in low-dimensional projections of the sensing matrix's null-space using neural networks, improving interpretability and flexibility in imaging inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing priors for imaging inverse problems ignore the task-specific structure of the null-space, leading to suboptimal solutions. The goal is to design priors that capture information orthogonal to signal components blind to the sensing process.

Method: NPN regularization enforces solutions to lie in low-dimensional projections of the sensing matrix's null-space using neural networks, rather than imposing structural constraints in the image domain. It can be integrated with existing reconstruction frameworks.

Result: Empirical results show NPN priors consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity across various imaging inverse problems including compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, CT, and MRI, working with plug-and-play methods, unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

Conclusion: NPN provides a novel class of regularization that is interpretable, flexible, and complementary to conventional image-domain priors, with theoretical guarantees on convergence and reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from
undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite
solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,
prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or
learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors
typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,
we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel
class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in
the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection
of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two
key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the
null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information
orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing
process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,
compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to
conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on
convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.
Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors
consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse
problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,
unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art HIV subtype classification across in-house and LANL datasets, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more favorable cost-benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed system establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation in genomic medicine by delivering interpretable evidence and balancing accuracy with clinical utility.

Abstract: We propose an automated genomic interpretation module that transforms raw DNA
sequences into actionable, interpretable decisions suitable for integration
into medical automation and robotic systems. Our framework combines Chaos Game
Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing
predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC
content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate
concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution
matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV
subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers
interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological
priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs
into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical
utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art
classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more
favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging
the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making,
this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLA-R1 enhances Vision-Language-Action models with explicit reasoning through Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards and Group Relative Policy Optimization, improving generalization and real-world performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, emit final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations, and have weak post-training reward designs.

Method: Integrates RLVR with GRPO for systematic optimization of reasoning and execution, uses verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting, and develops VLA-CoT-13K dataset with chain-of-thought supervision.

Result: Achieves superior generalization and real-world performance on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms compared to prior VLA methods.

Conclusion: VLA-R1 demonstrates that integrating explicit reasoning with reinforcement learning significantly enhances VLA model capabilities for embodied AI applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We
plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this

*Yifan Zhao,Liangchen Li,Yuqi Zhou,Kai Wang,Yan Liang,Juyong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a joint deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography that simultaneously optimizes clear 3D models and defocus blur kernels using differentiable rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defocus blur in macrophotography hinders clear imaging and high-quality 3D reconstruction of small objects, while traditional methods require extensive data and annotations.

Method: Uses differentiable rendering to jointly optimize clear 3D models and per-pixel defocus blur kernels from multi-view blurry images in a self-supervised manner.

Result: Achieves high-quality image deblurring and recovers high-fidelity 3D appearance from a small number of multi-view images.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses defocus blur in macrophotography and enables high-quality 3D reconstruction without requiring large datasets or annotations.

Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and
3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information.
However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that
heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D
reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large
number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D
reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint
deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from
multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of
the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework
adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of
the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from
a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve
high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FideDiff is a novel single-step diffusion model for high-fidelity motion deblurring that reformulates the problem as a diffusion-like process and trains a consistency model to enable accurate one-step deblurring with superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity in existing diffusion models for image deblurring, while leveraging the strong generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models.

Method: Reformulates motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process with progressively blurred images, trains a consistency model to align all timesteps to clean images, integrates Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation, and introduces adaptive timestep prediction.

Result: Achieves superior performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based methods and matching other state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: FideDiff offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to high-fidelity image restoration tasks and establishes a robust baseline for advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and
transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion
models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for
high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger
generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However,
challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still
limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce
FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity
deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where
each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a
consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By
reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns
temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance
model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation
and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior
performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based
methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff
offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to
high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our

TL;DR: A two-stage pipeline with LadderMoE adapters for bronze inscription recognition that handles severe degradation, multi-domain variability, and long-tailed character distribution, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bronze inscriptions are crucial for archaeological studies but face challenges including severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability (photographs, rubbings, tracings), and extremely long-tailed character distribution, making automatic recognition difficult.

Method: Developed a two-stage detection-recognition pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with ladder-style Mixture of Experts adapters for dynamic expert specialization and robustness across heterogeneous domains.

Result: Substantially outperforms state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy across head, mid, and tail character categories and all acquisition modalities (photographs, rubbings, tracings).

Conclusion: The method establishes a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition and downstream archaeological analysis, effectively addressing the core challenges of multi-domain variability and long-tailed distribution.

Abstract: Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial
stage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for
archaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition
remains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability
across photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed
character distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI
dataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters
spanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation.
Building on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition
pipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual
characters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the
pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with
ladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger
robustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page
recognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy
across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities.
These results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition
and downstream archaeological analysis.

*Duy Nguyen,Dat Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VirDA proposes a parameter-efficient UDA method using visual reprogramming layers instead of full backbone fine-tuning, achieving competitive accuracy with significantly fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA methods require fine-tuning entire backbones for each source-target pair, leading to linear growth in parameters and storage, and preventing backbone reuse.

Method: Prepends domain-specific visual reprogramming layers to produce visual prompts that add textural bias to adapt input style to target domain, without modifying backbone parameters.

Result: Achieves 92.8% mean accuracy on Office-31 with only 1.5M trainable parameters, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while using significantly fewer parameters (1.7-46% of baselines).

Conclusion: VirDA enables efficient domain adaptation by reusing backbone parameters across domains through visual reprogramming, offering a parameter-efficient alternative to full fine-tuning.

Abstract: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for
every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training
parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also
preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters.
  Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases,
we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation
via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA.Instead of fine-tuning the full
backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the
backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias
to the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize
these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that
optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when
domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require
modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused
across different domains.
  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M
trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its
parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans
and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8%
of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods
(PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only
2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFE is an unsupervised, data-driven facial expression encoding method that uses RVQ-VAE to create a compact, interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from 3D mesh sequences, outperforming FACS and other methods in psychological tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing facial expression coding systems like FACS have limited coverage and require costly manual annotation, creating a need for scalable, data-driven alternatives.

Method: Extracts identity-invariant expression features using 3DMM, then encodes them with Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE) to produce discrete tokens from a shared codebook.

Result: DFE captures more precise facial behaviors than FACS and outperforms FACS-based pipelines and representation learning models in stress detection, personality prediction, and depression detection tasks.

Conclusion: DFE serves as a scalable and effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing applications, covering a wider variety of facial displays.

Abstract: Facial expression analysis is central to understanding human behavior, yet
existing coding systems such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) are
constrained by limited coverage and costly manual annotation. In this work, we
introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven
alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from
3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant
expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively
disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode
these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a
shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial
deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures
more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives.
We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level
psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression
detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned
tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and
strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked
Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider
variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and
effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing
applications.

TL;DR: Con-NRSfM is a novel method for non-rigid structure-from-motion under conformal deformations that performs point-wise reconstruction using 2D image warps optimized through graph-based framework, eliminating strict assumptions and accurately computing local conformal scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing NRSfM methods that rely on strict assumptions like locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, fail to recover conformal scale, and have inseparable depth and conformal scale constraints.

Method: Uses point-wise reconstruction with 2D selected image warps optimized through graph-based framework, employs parallel separable iterative optimization strategy, and incorporates self-supervised learning with encoder-decoder network for dense 3D point clouds with texture.

Result: Demonstrated superior reconstruction accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed Con-NRSfM method successfully eliminates restrictive assumptions, accurately computes local conformal scale, enables precise depth estimation, and outperforms existing methods in reconstruction performance.

Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing
the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel
method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing
isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise
reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based
framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as
locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the
conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately
computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples
constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other
approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity
of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative
optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,
utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D
point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website:

*Jin Cao,Hongrui Wu,Ziyong Feng,Hujun Bao,Xiaowei Zhou,Sida Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVerse is a unified framework that decouples robust 3D reconstruction from inconsistent multi-view images into restoration and reconstruction subtasks, using a video diffusion model to restore consistency before reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for robust 3D reconstruction from inconsistent multi-view images rely heavily on dense observations and complex degradation modeling, limiting their generalization to diverse inconsistencies.

Method: Proposes UniVerse framework that: 1) converts inconsistent images to initial videos, 2) uses a specially designed video diffusion model to restore consistency, 3) reconstructs 3D scenes from restored images. Leverages diffusion model's scene prior learned from large-scale data.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show strong generalization capability and superior performance in robust reconstruction. The method can also control the style of reconstructed 3D scenes.

Conclusion: Decoupling restoration and reconstruction simplifies optimization and enables better handling of diverse image inconsistencies through diffusion model's learned scene prior, achieving robust 3D reconstruction with style control capability.

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of
reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some
recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and
perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D
scene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations
for robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to
decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and
reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this
end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based
on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent
images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion
model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D
scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view
degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from
large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image
inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of
our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style
of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page:

### [29] [An Efficient Deep Template Matching and In-Plane Pose Estimation Method via Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01678)
*Ke Jia,Ji Zhou,Hanxin Li,Zhigan Zhou,Haojie Chu,Xiaojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight end-to-end framework for template matching that jointly estimates position, rotation, and scaling through template-aware dynamic convolution and geometric regression, achieving high precision with 14ms inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional template matching methods are inefficient due to exhaustive enumeration of angles and scales, while deep learning approaches lack explicit geometric pose modeling, making them unsuitable for real-world industrial applications requiring precise geometric state estimation.

Method: Proposes joint localization and geometric regression with Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution Module (TDCM) that injects template features dynamically. Uses depthwise separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficiency, rotation-shear-based augmentation for geometric-annotation-free training, and a lightweight refinement module for improved precision.

Result: The 3.07M parameter model achieves high precision with 14ms inference time under compound transformations, demonstrating strong robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios suitable for real-time industrial deployment.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of traditional and deep learning methods by providing efficient, precise geometric state estimation for template matching, making it highly suitable for real-time industrial inspection and alignment tasks.

Abstract: In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching
requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state
(rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream
operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and
scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile,
most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without
explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world
deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end
framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and
geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and
independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic
Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to
guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise
separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable
geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based
augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight
refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local
optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms
inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong
robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly
suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications. The code is

### [30] [Look Less, Reason More: Rollout-Guided Adaptive Pixel-Space Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01681)
*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Jiahui Gao,Renjie Pi,Shiyu Hu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for adaptive pixel reasoning that enables Vision-Language Models to dynamically determine when to use pixel-level visual operations based on query difficulty, achieving superior performance while significantly reducing unnecessary visual computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with fine-grained visual understanding due to information loss during image encoding and insufficient attention to critical regions. Existing pixel-level approaches are inefficient and often distracted by irrelevant visual details.

Method: Operation-aware supervised fine-tuning followed by rollout-guided reinforcement learning that uses the model's own response feedback to determine when pixel operations should be invoked based on query difficulty.

Result: Achieves 73.4% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K with only 20.1% tool usage ratio, improving accuracy while reducing tool usage by 66.5% compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive pixel reasoning framework enables VLMs to achieve better performance with significantly fewer visual operations, making them more efficient and effective for fine-grained multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they
frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of
fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during
image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has
shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the
reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details
during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often
overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual
details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for
adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level
operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply
operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in
textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided
reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own
responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be
invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal
reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while
significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model
achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of
only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by
66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

*Han-Jay Shu,Wei-Ning Chiu,Shun-Ting Chang,Meng-Ping Huang,Takeshi Tohyama,Ahram Han,Po-Chih Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ASRS framework using rotation augmentations and embedding shifts to identify error-prone chest X-ray cases without labels, improving selective prediction and fairness in medical AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fairness and reliability concerns in chest radiograph interpretation where models show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups and existing error detection methods struggle with subtle within-distribution errors.

Method: Augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) applies clinically plausible rotations (±15°/±30°) and measures embedding shifts using RAD-DINO encoder to stratify samples into stability quartiles based on sensitivity scores.

Result: Highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall (-0.2 to -0.3) despite high AUROC and confidence, demonstrating ASRS can identify error-prone cases effectively.

Conclusion: ASRS provides a label-free means for selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in medical AI by identifying cases requiring additional scrutiny.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR)
interpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often
show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not
reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on
confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with
subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level
consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose
an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify
error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm
15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO
encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where
highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$)
despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for
selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in
medical AI.

*Jiacong Xu,Yiqun Mei,Ke Zhang,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeViS is a training-free video stylization framework that uses a pretrained image-to-video model with multiple stylized references to generate temporally consistent videos with rich style details, avoiding flickers and stutters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video stylization methods either suffer from temporal inconsistency when applied frame-by-frame or require expensive paired video data training, creating a need for practical and economic solutions.

Method: Integrates multiple stylized references into a pretrained I2V model, uses high-frequency compensation to constrain content layout and motion, and employs flow-based motion cues to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions.

Result: Outperforms recent baselines with higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal consistency, achieving strong human preference in evaluations.

Conclusion: FreeViS provides a practical and economic training-free solution for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization.

Abstract: Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a
challenging problem. Na\"ively applying image stylization frame-by-frame hurts
temporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a
dedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free
video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style
details and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized
references to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating
the propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers
and stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to
constrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues
to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive
evaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal
consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human
preference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution
for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization. The code and videos

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedQ-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on medical image quality assessment, introducing perception and reasoning tasks across five imaging modalities with 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical IQA approaches are limited by scalar score-based metrics and fail to capture the descriptive, human-like reasoning process used by clinical experts, creating a gap in AI evaluation for clinical safety.

Method: The benchmark defines two complementary tasks: MedQ-Perception (low-level perceptual capability) and MedQ-Reasoning (no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks). It spans five imaging modalities, covers over forty quality attributes, and includes diverse image sources (clinical acquisitions, simulated degradations, AI-generated images). A multi-dimensional judging protocol assesses model outputs along four axes.

Result: Evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs shows models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills, with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. Human-AI alignment validation confirms these limitations.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs require targeted optimization for medical IQA applications. MedQ-Bench aims to catalyze further exploration and unlock the potential of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

Abstract: Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate
for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar,
score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning
process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce
MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning
paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary
tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via
human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2)
MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks,
aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The
benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes,
totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering
diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with
simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated
images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging
protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further
conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement
with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates
that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills,
with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight
the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that
MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential
of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

*Pierre Musacchio,Hyunmin Lee,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaFormer is a network that predicts full occlusion and depth orderings for all instances in a scene from a single RGB image input, using object queries and latent mask descriptors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems for understanding instance-wise geometries require expensive input formats (category labels, segmentation masks) and inference costs (quadratic forward passes), which limits their practicality.

Method: InstaFormer uses interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary information, enabling holistic order prediction in a single forward pass.

Result: The approach is comprehensively benchmarked and ablated to highlight its effectiveness in predicting occlusion and depth orderings.

Conclusion: InstaFormer provides an efficient solution for instance-wise geometry understanding by eliminating the need for expensive inputs and reducing inference costs to a single forward pass.

Abstract: Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a
challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized
systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels,
binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward
passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network
capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image,
InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the
instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer
relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that
semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary
information. We comprehensively benchmark and ablate our approach to highlight
its effectiveness. Our code and models are open-source and available at this
URL: https://github.com/SNU-VGILab/InstaOrder.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PyramidStyler is a transformer framework with Pyramidal Positional Encoding that improves neural style transfer by capturing multi-scale details while reducing computational load, achieving real-time high-quality artistic rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN and transformer-based NST models struggle with scaling to complex styles and high-resolution inputs efficiently.

Method: Transformer framework with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE) for hierarchical multi-scale encoding, plus reinforcement learning for dynamic stylization optimization.

Result: Reduces content loss by 62.6% (to 2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs with 1.39s inference time; further improves to content 2.03 and style 0.75 with RL at 1.40s.

Conclusion: Demonstrates real-time, high-quality artistic rendering with broad applications in media and design.

Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) has evolved from Gatys et al.'s (2015) CNN-based
algorithm, enabling AI-driven artistic image synthesis. However, existing CNN
and transformer-based models struggle to scale efficiently to complex styles
and high-resolution inputs. We introduce PyramidStyler, a transformer framework
with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE): a hierarchical, multi-scale encoding
that captures both local details and global context while reducing
computational load. We further incorporate reinforcement learning to
dynamically optimize stylization, accelerating convergence. Trained on
Microsoft COCO and WikiArt, PyramidStyler reduces content loss by 62.6% (to
2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs--achieving 1.39 s
inference--and yields further improvements (content 2.03; style 0.75) with
minimal speed penalty (1.40 s) when using RL. These results demonstrate
real-time, high-quality artistic rendering, with broad applications in media
and design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoBE-GS is a load-balanced and efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that addresses scalability issues in large-scale scene reconstruction through depth-aware partitioning, optimization-based load balancing, and lightweight optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing divide-and-conquer methods for 3D Gaussian Splatting suffer from load imbalance and inefficient coarse-to-fine pipelines when scaling to large unbounded scenes like city blocks, causing memory pressure and high overhead.

Method: Introduces depth-aware partitioning for fast preprocessing, optimization-based strategy to balance visible Gaussians across blocks, and lightweight techniques including visibility cropping and selective densification to reduce training costs.

Result: Achieves up to 2× faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining reconstruction quality, enabling scalability to scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

Conclusion: LoBE-GS successfully addresses the scalability challenges of 3D Gaussian Splatting for large-scale scenes through efficient partitioning and load balancing strategies.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient
representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However,
scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains
difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by
partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i)
partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits
do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines
fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model
and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel
Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers
the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning
method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based
strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational
load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and
selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on
large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves
up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to
scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

*Xiaofei Wu,Guozhen Zhang,Zhiyong Xu,Yuan Zhou,Qinglin Lu,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MemoryPack for dynamic context modeling and Direct Forcing to address error accumulation in long-form video generation, improving temporal consistency and training-inference alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form video generation faces challenges in capturing long-range dependencies and preventing error accumulation during autoregressive decoding, which limits practical usability.

Method: MemoryPack: a learnable context-retrieval mechanism using textual and image information as global guidance to model short- and long-term dependencies. Direct Forcing: an efficient single-step approximating strategy to improve training-inference alignment.

Result: The approach achieves minute-level temporal consistency, scales gracefully with video length, maintains linear complexity, and substantially enhances context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation.

Conclusion: MemoryPack and Direct Forcing together advance the practical usability of autoregressive video models by addressing key challenges in long-form video generation.

Abstract: Long-form video generation presents a dual challenge: models must capture
long-range dependencies while preventing the error accumulation inherent in
autoregressive decoding. To address these challenges, we make two
contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a
learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image
information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term
dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales
gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains
linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct
Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves
training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during
inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the
context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing
the practical usability of autoregressive video models.

*Cornelius Schröder,Marius-Raphael Schlüter,Markus Lienkamp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes methods for confidence calibration in 3D object detectors, introducing metrics and loss terms to improve calibration of both dominant and secondary class predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise object detection and uncertainty estimation are critical for safe autonomous systems, requiring proper confidence calibration for 3D object detectors.

Method: Proposed two auxiliary regularizing loss terms for calibration of dominant predictions or full prediction vectors, and evaluated post-hoc and train-time methods on CenterPoint, PillarNet and DSVT-Pillar detectors.

Result: Combining the full class prediction calibration loss with isotonic regression achieved best calibration for CenterPoint and PillarNet, but DSVT-Pillar could not be jointly calibrated for both dominant and secondary predictions.

Conclusion: Different 3D object detectors require tailored calibration approaches, with the proposed full-class calibration loss combined with isotonic regression being effective for some architectures but not universally applicable.

Abstract: In autonomous systems, precise object detection and uncertainty estimation
are critical for self-aware and safe operation. This work addresses confidence
calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that
it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence
distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the
calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two
auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the
dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We
evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet
and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for
calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the
best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and
secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be
jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same
method.

TL;DR: DiffPS is a novel person search framework that leverages pre-trained diffusion models to address optimization conflicts between detection and re-identification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use ImageNet pre-trained backbones that are suboptimal for capturing spatial context and fine-grained identity cues, and suffer from conflicting optimization objectives between detection and re-identification tasks.

Method: Proposes three specialized modules: Diffusion-Guided Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for person localization, Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to reduce shape bias, and Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to utilize text-aligned diffusion features.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art performance on CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets.

Conclusion: DiffPS effectively leverages diffusion priors to eliminate optimization conflicts and improve person search performance through specialized modules for localization, bias reduction, and feature aggregation.

Abstract: Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification
by localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped
scene images. Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained
backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context
and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely
on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification,
leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In
this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a
novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating
the optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of
diffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided
Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii)
Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and
(iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage
text-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on
CUHK-SYSU and PRW.

TL;DR: FMU integrates flow matching into HSI reconstruction using a deep unfolding framework with mean velocity loss for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI is costly to acquire and existing compressive sensing systems struggle with severe degradation and loss of fine spectral details.

Method: Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU) that embeds flow matching generative prior within deep unfolding framework with mean velocity loss.

Result: FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction quality on both simulated and real datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid design successfully leverages interpretability of optimization-based methods and generative capacity of flow matching for superior HSI reconstruction.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spatial-spectral information but
remains costly to acquire due to hardware limitations and the difficulty of
reconstructing three-dimensional data from compressed measurements. Although
compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate
reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine
spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU),
which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI
reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding
framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean
velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more
robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the
interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of
flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show
that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction
quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/YiAi03/FMU.

TL;DR: Proposes an automated defect detection system for dual in-line packages using deep learning and ConSinGAN data augmentation, achieving 95.50% accuracy with YOLOv7.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional defect detection is time-consuming and labor-intensive, creating burden on quality inspection personnel and making quality management difficult.

Method: Uses digital camera optics and deep learning models (YOLOv3, v4, v7, v9) with ConSinGAN for data augmentation to address lack of defective component images. Focuses on surface and pin-leg defects in DIP components.

Result: YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN achieved best performance with 95.50% accuracy and 285 ms detection time, significantly outperforming threshold-based approaches and other YOLO versions.

Conclusion: The proposed automated defect detection system can be easily established for various defect types and works effectively even with insufficient defect data, with SCADA system integration for industrial implementation.

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality
inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this
paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line
package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and
a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP
are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack
of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To
solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset
for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated
(v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation.
The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in
accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to
threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture
is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established
with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

*Guangyao Zhai,Yue Zhou,Xinyan Deng,Lars Heckler,Nassir Navab,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundAD is a few-shot anomaly detection method that uses foundation visual encoders and a nonlinear projection operator to identify anomalies by measuring embedding differences from the natural image manifold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot anomaly detection is challenging due to limited samples and category-agnostic conditions. Foundation visual encoders trained on large datasets can learn general normal image distributions, providing a basis for anomaly detection.

Method: The method learns a nonlinear projection operator onto the natural image manifold. This operator identifies out-of-distribution regions by measuring the difference between learned embeddings, leveraging the observation that anomaly amount correlates with embedding differences.

Result: Extensive experiments show FoundAD supports multi-class detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer parameters than prior methods. Validated with multiple foundation encoders including DINOv3.

Conclusion: The approach broadens the perspective on foundation features and advances few-shot anomaly detection by effectively leveraging pre-trained visual encoders for anomaly identification.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety
inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between
normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under
category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual
encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to
learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly
amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt
embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed
FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the
natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for
anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in
an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class
detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer
parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple
foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the
perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly
detection.

*Fabio Montello,Ronja Güldenring,Lazaros Nalpantidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClustViT is a Vision Transformer architecture that reduces computational complexity for semantic segmentation by merging similar tokens using a trainable Cluster module and restoring details with a Regenerator module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers have quadratic attention complexity that limits their practical use in real-world robotic systems, and existing token merging approaches work well for classification but are less suitable for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation.

Method: Expands ViT backbone with a trainable Cluster module that merges similar tokens guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks, followed by a Regenerator module that restores fine details for downstream heads.

Result: Achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three datasets while maintaining comparable segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: ClustViT effectively reduces computational complexity for semantic segmentation while preserving accuracy, making Vision Transformers more practical for real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization
across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world
robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent
works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image
complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to
dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision
Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our
architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the
network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a
Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach
achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different
datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be
made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PaDT introduces a unified paradigm for MLLMs to directly generate both textual and visual outputs using Visual Reference Tokens, achieving SOTA performance across multiple vision tasks without relying on indirect representations like coordinate text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM approaches for vision tasks rely on indirect representations (e.g., generating coordinates as text), which limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation.

Method: PaDT uses Visual Reference Tokens derived from visual patch embeddings, interleaved with LLM's textual tokens. A lightweight decoder transforms outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Features independent VRT processing and dynamic embedding table expansion.

Result: Consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across four visual perception and understanding tasks, even outperforming significantly larger MLLM models.

Conclusion: PaDT provides an effective unified paradigm for direct visual output generation in MLLMs, overcoming limitations of indirect representation approaches and enabling dense prediction tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent
years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect
representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which
limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a
unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and
diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs),
derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly
with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's
outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior
methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically
expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation
among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by
randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust
per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual
perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM
models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

*Jianfei Xie,Ziyang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the trust deficit in online produce e-commerce by proposing a 'Trust Pyramid' model and 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI) to quantify trade-offs in agricultural grading. It introduces TriAlignXA, an explainable AI framework that transforms algorithms from decision-makers to transparent decision-support tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The trust deficit in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce arises from the inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of product quality, creating a fundamental barrier to consumer trust.

Method: The paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through 'dual-source verification' and proposes the TriAlignXA framework with three engines: Bio-Adaptive Engine for quality description, Timeliness Optimization Engine for processing efficiency, and Economic Optimization Engine for cost control. It also uses a 'Pre-Mapping Mechanism' with QR codes for transparent quality information.

Result: Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the framework's balancing capability in addressing the 'impossible triangle' of agricultural product grading.

Conclusion: The research provides comprehensive support from theory to practice for building a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust through transparent, explainable AI systems.

Abstract: The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the
inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of
product quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through
'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality
is the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in
agricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics,
timeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional
absolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose
the 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from
'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases',
designing the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports
trustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through
multi-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the
Bio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness
Optimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization
Engine for cost control. Additionally, the "Pre-Mapping Mechanism" encodes
process data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information.
Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than
baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the
framework's balancing capability in addressing the "impossible triangle". This
research provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building
a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from
algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.

*Lei Liu,Can Wang,Zhenghao Chen,Dong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DGS-Craft is a consistent and interactive 4D Gaussian Splatting editing framework that addresses view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency issues through 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix, multi-view grid optimization, Gaussian selection, and LLM-based intent understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 4D Gaussian Splatting editing methods struggle with maintaining consistency across views and time, preserving non-edited regions, and handling complex text instructions, limiting their practical usability.

Method: Proposes 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix with 4D VGGT geometry features, multi-view grid module for iterative refinement, Gaussian selection mechanism for region-specific optimization, and LLM-based module for intent understanding and operation decomposition.

Result: The framework achieves more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing compared to related works, with improved handling of complex user instructions and better preservation of non-edited regions.

Conclusion: 4DGS-Craft successfully addresses key challenges in 4DGS editing by ensuring consistency across multiple dimensions and enabling interactive editing through intelligent intent understanding, representing a significant advancement in 4D scene manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges
with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with
handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose
4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first
introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal
consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from
the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures
during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module
that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while
jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the
consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,
which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.
Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective
4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent
understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic
editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our
framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a
logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user
commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works,
our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our
code will be made available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Pure-Pass (PP) is a pixel-level masking mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive computations in image super-resolution, achieving better performance than CAMixer with similar computational savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight SR methods like CAMixer have limitations including poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking, and spatial inflexibility. The goal is to develop a more efficient and flexible masking approach.

Method: PP uses fixed color center points to classify pixels into distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking. It identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive computations.

Result: Integrated into ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and parameter efficiency while saving similar computation.

Conclusion: Pure-Pass provides an effective pixel-level masking mechanism that improves adaptability and spatial flexibility in lightweight super-resolution models while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from
low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep
learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the
pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods
and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities
according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations
remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial
inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking
mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive
computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into
distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while
maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art
ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal
overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and
parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.

*Nanaka Hosokawa,Ryo Takahashi,Tomoya Kitano,Yukihiro Iida,Chisako Muramatsu,Tatsuro Hayashi,Yuta Seino,Xiangrong Zhou,Takeshi Hara,Akitoshi Katsumata,Hiroshi Fujita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output (SLSO) framework using GPT-4o to automatically generate jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs, showing improved accuracy over conventional Chain-of-Thought methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of automated jaw cyst finding generation on dental panoramic radiographs by addressing inconsistencies and hallucinations in AI-generated outputs.

Method: Developed a 10-step SLSO framework including image analysis, structured data generation, tooth number extraction with consistency checking, iterative regeneration for inconsistencies, and finding generation with restructuring and verification. Compared against conventional Chain-of-Thought method.

Result: SLSO improved output accuracy: 66.9% for tooth number, 33.3% for tooth movement, and 28.6% for root resorption. Successful cases achieved structured output after up to five regenerations. The framework enforced negative finding descriptions and suppressed hallucinations.

Conclusion: The SLSO framework shows promise for improving automated finding generation but requires further refinement, especially for extensive lesions spanning multiple teeth, to achieve practical clinical application.

Abstract: In this study, we utilized the multimodal capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4o to
automatically generate jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs. To
improve accuracy, we constructed a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output
(SLSO) framework and verified its effectiveness. A 10-step process was
implemented for 22 cases of jaw cysts, including image input and analysis,
structured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking,
iterative regeneration when inconsistencies were detected, and finding
generation with subsequent restructuring and consistency verification. A
comparative experiment was conducted using the conventional Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure,
borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures,
and tooth number. The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved
output accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates
for tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the
successful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to
five regenerations. Although statistical significance was not reached because
of the small size of the dataset, the overall SLSO framework enforced negative
finding descriptions, suppressed hallucinations, and improved tooth number
identification accuracy. However, the accurate identification of extensive
lesions spanning multiple teeth is limited. Nevertheless, further refinement is
required to enhance overall performance and move toward a practical finding
generation system.

Method: Proposed LiLa-Net architecture with reduced encoder layers and simplified skip connections to create an efficient latent space for accurate point cloud reconstruction from LiDAR data collected from a semi-autonomous vehicle.

Result: Achieved effective balance between skip connection information and latent encoding, leading to improved reconstruction quality without performance compromise. The model also demonstrated strong generalization by reconstructing objects outside the original traffic environment.

Conclusion: LiLa-Net successfully creates an efficient 3D autoencoder that accurately reconstructs LiDAR point clouds with simplified architecture while maintaining performance and demonstrating good generalization capabilities.

Abstract: This work proposed a 3D autoencoder architecture, named LiLa-Net, which
encodes efficient features from real traffic environments, employing only the
LiDAR's point clouds. For this purpose, we have real semi-autonomous vehicle,
equipped with Velodyne LiDAR. The system leverage skip connections concept to
improve the performance without using extensive resources as the
state-of-the-art architectures. Key changes include reducing the number of
encoder layers and simplifying the skip connections, while still producing an
efficient and representative latent space which allows to accurately
reconstruct the original point cloud. Furthermore, an effective balance has
been achieved between the information carried by the skip connections and the
latent encoding, leading to improved reconstruction quality without
compromising performance. Finally, the model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities, successfully reconstructing objects unrelated to the original
traffic environment.

TL;DR: kabr-tools is an open-source package for automated multi-species behavioral monitoring using drone-based video and machine learning to extract behavioral, social, and spatial metrics from wildlife footage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional field observations are limited in scope, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering comprehensive assessment of behavioral responses across landscapes.

Method: Integrates drone-based video with machine learning systems (object detection, tracking, behavioral classification) to extract behavioral metrics including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat associations, and group composition dynamics.

Result: Drone-based observations improved behavioral granularity, reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher accuracy. Validated through three case studies analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, revealing species-specific behavioral patterns and spatial segregation in mixed-species herds.

Conclusion: kabr-tools enables automated behavioral monitoring at scale, offering a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies that advances conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable
approaches to quantify and interpret complex, multidimensional behavioral
patterns. Traditional field observations are often limited in scope,
time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral
responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan
Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated
multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based
video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial
metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection,
tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics,
including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat
associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods,
drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity,
reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher
accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies,
analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional
methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras,
vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains
zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit
strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and
observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and
giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at
scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing
conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

TL;DR: GaussianMorphing is a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape and texture morphing from multi-view images using mesh-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches rely on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured data, which limits their effectiveness for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling.

Method: Leverages mesh-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting with unified deformation strategy that anchors 3D Gaussians to mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent transformations and preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware constraints.

Result: Outperforms prior 2D/3D methods on TexMorph benchmark, reducing color consistency error (ΔE) by 22.2% and EI by 26.2%.

Conclusion: The framework enables semantic-aware 3D morphing with preserved local detail and global semantic coherence without requiring labeled data.

Abstract: We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape
and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely
on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured
data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling.
The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors
3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent
transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware
constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic
correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains
structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This
integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence
throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our
proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior
2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by

*Sahil Bhandary Karnoor,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InPose: A zero-shot generalization method for human pose estimation using diffusion models conditioned only on rotational measurements, guided by location measurements through likelihood terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pose estimation methods using conditional diffusion models fail to generalize across users because location measurements are highly influenced by body size variations.

Method: Formulates pose estimation as an inverse problem using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on rotational measurements alone, guided by location measurements through a likelihood term.

Result: Proposed InPose method can generatively estimate pose sequences that best explain sparse on-body measurements with zero-shot generalization across users.

Conclusion: InPose enables robust pose estimation that generalizes across different users by decoupling body-size-dependent location measurements from the core diffusion model conditioning.

Abstract: Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including
their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical
settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown
promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction
is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors.
Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users,
primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size
of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem
and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes
a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements
alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived
from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method
generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains
the sparse on-body measurements.

Conclusion: The hybrid transformer-diffusion design provides improved robustness and scalability in neuro-oncology, advancing beyond conventional U-Net baselines and showing potential to advance the state of the art in tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical
monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the
backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture
long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures.
Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for

  In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor
Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework
for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer
at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual
reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy
and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective
modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion
refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor

  This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and
scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data for France before the 1970s, which hinders quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl.

Method: A dual-pass U-Net approach: first pass generates preliminary maps to identify confusing areas for targeted data augmentation, second pass uses refined dataset and binarized output to minimize radiometric noise and reduce false positives.

Result: Successfully processed 941 high-resolution tiles covering all of metropolitan France, achieving 73% overall accuracy in capturing diverse urban patterns while overcoming map artifacts like labels and contour lines.

Conclusion: The study provides the first open-access national-scale urban footprint dataset for 1925-1950 France, with released code, training datasets, and resulting raster to support future urbanization research.

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl in France before the 1970s
is hindered by the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data. This study
bridges this gap by developing a scalable deep learning pipeline to extract
urban areas from the Scan Histo historical map series (1925-1950), which
produces the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for this
pivotal period. Our key innovation is a dual-pass U-Net approach designed to
handle the high radiometric and stylistic complexity of historical maps. The
first pass, trained on an initial dataset, generates a preliminary map that
identifies areas of confusion, such as text and roads, to guide targeted data
augmentation. The second pass uses a refined dataset and the binarized output
of the first model to minimize radiometric noise, which significantly reduces
false positives. Deployed on a high-performance computing cluster, our method
processes 941 high-resolution tiles covering the entirety of metropolitan
France. The final mosaic achieves an overall accuracy of 73%, effectively
capturing diverse urban patterns while overcoming common artifacts like labels
and contour lines. We openly release the code, training datasets, and the
resulting nationwide urban raster to support future research in long-term
urbanization dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of point-based tracking failure modes in surgical videos shows it works well for tools but fails for anatomical targets due to tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand the reliability and failure cases of point-based tracking in complex surgical environments, particularly for laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos.

Method: Systematic analysis comparing point-based tracking with segmentation mask initialization for three surgical targets (gallbladder, grasper, L-hook electrocautery) in laparoscopic videos.

Result: Point-based tracking is competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical targets due to tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries.

Conclusion: Provides actionable recommendations for selecting and placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis, with point-based tracking being suitable for tools but problematic for anatomical structures.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) models such as SAM2 offer promising zero-shot
tracking capabilities for surgical videos using minimal user input. Among the
available input types, point-based tracking offers an efficient and low-cost
alternative, yet its reliability and failure cases in complex surgical
environments are not well understood. In this work, we systematically analyze
the failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy
videos. Focusing on three surgical targets, the gallbladder, grasper, and
L-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with
segmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is
competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical
targets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure.

*Ding-Ruei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FRIEREN framework for Federated Learning with unlabeled client data, leveraging Vision Foundation Models and vision-language integration to handle domain shifts without re-accessing source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in Federated Learning for Semantic Segmentation when client data is unlabeled and faces domain shifts, overcoming limitations of existing methods that assume labeled client data or don't leverage modern Vision Foundation Models.

Method: Uses Vision-Language decoder guided by CLIP-based text embeddings for semantic disambiguation, and weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on pseudo-labels from unlabeled client data.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on synthetic-to-real and clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks against established domain generalization and adaptation methods.

Conclusion: FRIEREN effectively tackles the challenging FFREEDG task and sets a strong baseline for future research in federated learning with unlabeled data and domain shifts.

Abstract: Federeated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for Semantic
Segmentation (SS) tasks to adapt to new domains, but faces significant
challenges from these domain shifts, particularly when client data is
unlabeled. However, most existing FL methods unrealistically assume access to
labeled data on remote clients or fail to leverage the power of modern Vision
Foundation Models (VFMs). Here, we propose a novel and challenging task,
FFREEDG, in which a model is pretrained on a server's labeled source dataset
and subsequently trained across clients using only their unlabeled data,
without ever re-accessing the source. To solve FFREEDG, we propose FRIEREN, a
framework that leverages the knowledge of a VFM by integrating vision and
language modalities. Our approach employs a Vision-Language decoder guided by
CLIP-based text embeddings to improve semantic disambiguation and uses a
weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on
pseudo-labels. Our experiments on synthetic-to-real and
clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively
tackles this new task, achieving competitive performance against established
domain generalization and adaptation methods and setting a strong baseline for
future research.

*Shu Zou,Xinyu Tian,Lukas Wesemann,Fabian Waschkowski,Zhaoyuan Yang,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASK-Hint is a structured prompting framework that uses action-centric knowledge to improve video anomaly detection with frozen vision-language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompts for video anomaly detection are too abstract and overlook fine-grained human-object interactions and action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos.

Method: Organizes prompts into semantically coherent groups (violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative visual cues.

Result: Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show consistent AUC improvements over prior baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free methods.

Conclusion: ASK-Hint demonstrates the critical role of prompt granularity and establishes itself as a new training-free, generalizable solution for explainable video anomaly detection with strong generalization across datasets and VLM backbones.

Abstract: Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language
models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are
often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions
or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We
propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages
action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning
from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent
groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates
fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative
visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that
ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free
methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces
towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM
backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and
establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for
explainable video anomaly detection.

### [58] [GeoPurify: A Data-Efficient Geometric Distillation Framework for Open-Vocabulary 3D Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02186)
*Weijia Dou,Xu Zhang,Yi Bin,Jian Liu,Bo Peng,Guoqing Wang,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoPurify addresses the trade-off in 3D semantic segmentation by using a Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features with geometric priors from a self-supervised teacher model, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 1.5% training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for transferring 2D VLM features to 3D segmentation either produce noisy predictions or require expensive training pipelines and large annotated datasets, failing to reconcile 2D semantics with 3D geometric structure.

Method: Proposes GeoPurify with a Student Affinity Network that purifies 2D VLM-generated 3D features using geometric priors from a 3D self-supervised teacher model, and a Geometry-Guided Pooling module for denoising during inference.

Result: GeoPurify achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance on major 3D benchmarks while using only about 1.5% of the training data, demonstrating superior data efficiency.

Conclusion: GeoPurify effectively mitigates the trade-off between 2D semantics and 3D geometry by leveraging latent geometric information and learned affinity networks, enabling high-performance 3D segmentation with minimal training data.

Abstract: Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D
features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing
geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale
annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant
segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with
3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the
2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated
features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small
Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using
geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During
inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the
point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from
latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify
effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency.
Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify
achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about
1.5% of the training data. Our codes and checkpoints are available at

*Emmanuel Nsengiyumvaa,Leonard Niyitegekaa,Eric Umuhoza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A non-invasive pig identification system using auricular vein patterns achieves 98.12% accuracy with SVM classification, providing a cost-effective alternative to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pig identification methods like ear tags and microchips are unreliable, costly, and impractical for small-scale farmers, creating a need for better solutions.

Method: Developed a multistage computer vision pipeline to enhance vein visibility from ear images captured with smartphones, extract structural/spatial features, and classify using machine learning models.

Result: Support Vector Machines achieved 98.12% identification accuracy across mixed-breed pigs, with average processing time of 8.3 seconds per identification.

Conclusion: Auricular vein biometrics provide a practical, cost-effective, and stress-free alternative to physical identifiers, enabling precision farming benefits for resource-constrained communities.

Abstract: Accurate livestock identification is a cornerstone of modern farming: it
supports health monitoring, breeding programs, and productivity tracking.
However, common pig identification methods, such as ear tags and microchips,
are often unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and thus impractical for
small-scale farmers. To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometric
identification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular vein
patterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed
pigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a
standard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision
pipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and
spatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then
classified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
achieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision
across mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to
classification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating
feasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragile
physical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system provides
farmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification.
More broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular vein
biometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential to
extend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agricultural
communities.

TL;DR: A multicategory counting framework using Twins pyramid vision-transformer with multi-class counting head and Category Focus Module for dense scenes, showing superior performance on benchmarks and applicability to biodiversity monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address object counting in dense and occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail, particularly for multi-category scenarios.

Method: Uses Twins pyramid vision-transformer backbone with multi-class counting head on multiscale decoding approach, plus a two-task design with segmentation-based Category Focus Module to suppress inter-category cross-talk during training.

Result: Demonstrates 33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE on VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks versus prior multicategory crowd-counting approaches, and comparison with YOLOv11 shows necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes.

Conclusion: The method's regional loss enables multi-class crowd counting in new domains, demonstrated through biodiversity monitoring applications, highlighting capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable ecological insights.

Abstract: Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and
occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a
multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid
vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built
on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a
segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk
at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks
demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting
approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11
underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The
method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains,
demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset,
highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable

### [61] [TempoControl: Temporal Attention Guidance for Text-to-Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02226)
*Shira Schiber,Ofir Lindenbaum,Idan Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TempoControl enables fine-grained temporal control in text-to-video generation by guiding cross-attention maps during inference, allowing users to specify when visual elements appear without retraining models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative video models lack fine-grained temporal control, preventing users from specifying when particular visual elements should appear within generated sequences.

Method: Uses cross-attention maps from text-to-video diffusion models and guides timing through a novel optimization approach with three principles: temporal shape alignment via correlation, amplification via energy, and spatial focus maintenance via entropy.

Result: Enables precise control over timing while maintaining high video quality and diversity across various applications including temporal reordering and audio-aligned generation.

Conclusion: TempoControl provides effective temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference without requiring retraining or additional supervision.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of
high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models
frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users
to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated
sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for
temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring
retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention
maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of
concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention
using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a
control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via
energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows
precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications,
including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as
action and audio-aligned generation.

*Sicheng Feng,Kaiwen Tuo,Song Wang,Lingdong Kong,Jianke Zhu,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RewardMap is a multi-stage RL framework that addresses sparse reward challenges in fine-grained visual reasoning for MLLMs through difficulty-aware rewards and progressive training from perception to complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in structured settings like transit maps due to sparse rewards and unstable optimization in standard RL approaches.

Method: Constructed ReasonMap-Plus dataset with dense VQA rewards, then developed RewardMap with difficulty-aware reward design and multi-stage RL scheme that bootstraps from simple perception to complex reasoning.

Result: Models trained with RewardMap achieved 3.47% average improvement across 6 benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and general tasks beyond transit maps.

Conclusion: RewardMap effectively enhances MLLMs' visual understanding and reasoning capabilities through its multi-stage RL approach and dense reward signals.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap
by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in
structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear
practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning
(RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To
address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that
introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks,
enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding
skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to
improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware
reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse
rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL
scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning
tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus
demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent
performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover,
models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6
benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and
general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding
and reasoning capabilities.

### [63] [DragFlow: Unleashing DiT Priors with Region Based Supervision for Drag Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02253)
*Zihan Zhou,Shilin Lu,Shuli Leng,Shaocong Zhang,Zhuming Lian,Xinlei Yu,Adams Wai-Kin Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DragFlow is the first framework to effectively use FLUX's strong generative priors for drag-based image editing, overcoming limitations of previous methods by introducing region-based editing with affine transformations and integrating personalization adapters for better subject consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous drag-based editing methods suffered from distortions due to insufficient priors from Stable Diffusion. With the shift to stronger DiT models like FLUX, there's an opportunity to improve drag editing, but direct application fails due to unstructured DiT features.

Method: Introduces region-based editing with affine transformations for richer feature supervision, integrates pretrained personalization adapters (IP-Adapter) for subject consistency, uses gradient mask-based constraints for background preservation, and employs MLLMs to resolve task ambiguities.

Result: DragFlow surpasses both point-based and region-based baselines on DragBench-DR and the novel ReD Bench benchmark, setting new state-of-the-art performance in drag-based image editing.

Conclusion: The proposed DragFlow framework successfully leverages FLUX's strong priors for drag-based editing through region-based supervision and personalization techniques, achieving significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target
region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion,
are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image
manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow
matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly
stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based
editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the
first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based
editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first
show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:
unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently
structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To
overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,
where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature
supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization
adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving
background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.
For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)
featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on
DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and
region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image
editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

*Guangyu Sun,Archit Singhal,Burak Uzkent,Mubarak Shah,Chen Chen,Garin Kessler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: F2C addresses the "needle in a haystack" problem in Video LLMs by selecting key clips instead of isolated frames, maintaining temporal coherence while keeping token count constant through adaptive resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video LLMs suffer from excessive visual tokens that exhaust context windows, and existing frame-wise selection methods discard essential temporal dynamics, leading to poor motion and event continuity reasoning.

Method: Proposes F2C approach that selects key clips (short temporally coherent segments) instead of isolated frames, with adaptive resolution strategy to balance spatial resolution and clip length while maintaining constant token count.

Result: Outperforms uniform sampling by 8.1% on Video-MME, 5.6% on LongVideoBench, and 10.3% on MLVU benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in video understanding.

Conclusion: Preserving temporal coherence through clip selection is crucial for video understanding, providing a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real-world applications.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a
variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the
"needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced
from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions
alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing
token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal
dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In
this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and
demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips,
which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To
maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token
footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically
balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count
per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our
training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and
10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These
results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame
selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world
video understanding applications. Project webpage is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with IMU sensors for movement assessment, finding MotionAGFormer performs best among video methods and both technologies are viable for out-of-lab kinematic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation, requiring comparison of accessible technologies.

Method: Used VIDIMU dataset with 13 daily activities captured by commodity cameras and 5 IMUs. Evaluated joint angles from deep learning frameworks (MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose, NVIDIA BodyTrack) against IMU data processed with OpenSim inverse kinematics.

Result: MotionAGFormer achieved best performance: lowest RMSE (9.27±4.80°), lowest MAE (7.86±4.18°), highest Pearson correlation (0.86±0.15), and highest R² (0.67±0.28). Both video and IMU approaches are viable for out-of-lab assessment.

Conclusion: Video models provide clinically promising kinematics in healthy adults but lag behind IMU-based estimates in some aspects. The study establishes guidelines for developing robust, cost-effective telehealth solutions, highlighting trade-offs between accessibility and precision.

Abstract: Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for
capturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories.
Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential
for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical
benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with
inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a
total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both
commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy
subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological
cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks
(MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA
BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using
OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17
keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance,
achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg
\pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$)
and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The
results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic
assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and
sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This
study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically
promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based
estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians
seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for
telehealth and remote patient monitoring.

TL;DR: NeuroSwift is a diffusion-based method that integrates AutoKL and CLIP adapters to reconstruct visual stimuli from fMRI data, achieving state-of-the-art cross-subject performance with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in cross-subject visual reconstruction from fMRI data, including inter-subject variability and the brain's abstract semantic encoding of complex visual inputs.

Method: Integrates complementary adapters via diffusion: AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. Uses pretraining on one subject followed by fine-tuning only 17% of parameters (fully connected layers) for new subjects.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: NeuroSwift enables efficient and accurate cross-subject visual reconstruction from brain activity with minimal computational requirements.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision
technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms.
Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving
accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and
computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject
variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core
semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we
propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion:
AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter
is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to
emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we
pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully
connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This
enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject
on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: microCLIP is a self-training framework that enhances CLIP's fine-grained classification by fusing saliency-guided local features with global features through TokenFusion and SOAP, achieving 2.90% average accuracy gain across 13 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's reliance on coarse global features limits its performance on fine-grained image classification tasks that require sensitivity to microscopic local cues, and prior approaches overlook spatial precision.

Method: Proposes microCLIP with Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP) in TokenFusion module to create saliency-guided [FG] token, two-headed LLM-derived classifier for stable pseudo-labeling, and Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation to combine fixed priors with evolving logits.

Result: Achieves consistent 2.90% average accuracy gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

Conclusion: microCLIP successfully uncovers latent fine-grained signals in CLIP through joint refinement of visual and textual representations using fine-grained cues, enabling improved fine-grained classification performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for
fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local
cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse
global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks.
Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model
(LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach
overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training
framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using
fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)
within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided
$\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global
$\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we
introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via
multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling,
and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned
with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which
convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to
iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent
fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy
gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

Conclusion: VidGuard-R1 successfully addresses the need for both accurate detection and transparent explanations in AI-generated video identification, demonstrating superior performance through multi-modal fine-tuning with specialized reward models.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need
for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation
and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential
that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency
for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce
VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy
optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and
insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and
AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully
designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then
fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target
temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing
benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies

*Justin Cui,Jie Wu,Ming Li,Tao Yang,Xiaojie Li,Rui Wang,Andrew Bai,Yuanhao Ban,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to mitigate quality degradation in long-horizon video generation without requiring long-video supervision, using teacher model guidance on self-generated video segments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for video generation suffer from computational costs and quality degradation when extending to long videos, with autoregressive approaches compounding errors in latent space.

Method: Uses teacher models to provide guidance for student models through sampled segments from self-generated long videos, maintaining temporal consistency without recomputing overlapping frames.

Result: Scales video length by up to 20x beyond teacher's capability, generates videos up to 4 minutes 15 seconds (50x longer than baseline), and outperforms baselines in fidelity and consistency.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses quality degradation in long-horizon video generation without requiring retraining or long-video supervision, achieving significant length extension while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving
unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer
architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when
extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive
formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from
short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models
cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their
training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from
the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in
long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video
teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on
exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the
student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.
Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to
20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure
and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous
methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of
generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the
maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x
longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and
our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially
outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency. Our long-horizon
videos demo can be found at https://self-forcing-plus-plus.github.io/

*David Romero,Ariana Bermudez,Hao Li,Fabio Pizzati,Ivan Laptev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KineMask is a physics-guided video generation approach that enables realistic rigid body control and interactions using a two-stage training strategy with video diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with physically plausible object interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms, limiting their use as world simulators for robotics and embodied decision making.

Method: Two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion supervision via object masks, training video diffusion models on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and integrating low-level motion control with high-level textual conditioning.

Result: Significant improvements in object interactions in real scenes, strong improvements over recent models of comparable size, and effective synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena.

Conclusion: KineMask successfully addresses limitations in physics-grounded control for video generation, with ablation studies highlighting the complementary roles of low- and high-level conditioning in video diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are
now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their
creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for
robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,
current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object
interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this
limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video
generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and
effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method
generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We
propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion
supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion
models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate
significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,
KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual
conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support
for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that
KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.
Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and
high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made
publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces fine-grained multimodal actions for real-time robot control, incorporating proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation to enable precise interactions that text-conditioned models struggle with.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video models fail as world models due to lack of fine-grained control, and general-purpose household robots need real-time fine motor control for delicate tasks and urgent situations.

Method: Developed a feature learning paradigm that aligns multimodal senses while preserving unique information from each modality, with a regularization scheme to enhance causality of action trajectory features.

Result: Experiments show incorporating multimodal senses improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Ablation studies and downstream applications demonstrate effectiveness and practicality.

Conclusion: Multimodal sensory integration enables fine-grained robot control that overcomes limitations of text-conditioned generative models, providing practical solutions for real-world household robot applications.

Abstract: Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control.
General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle
delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained
multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of
proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such
multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are
difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively
simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning
paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information
each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance
causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate
interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses
improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation
studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and
practicality of our work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoNSA adapts Native Sparse Attention to video-language models, enabling reliable scaling to 128K tokens and improved performance on long-video understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video understanding in multimodal models is limited by context length, causing models to miss key transition frames and struggle with coherence across long time scales.

Method: Adapt Native Sparse Attention (NSA) to video-language models, specifically Qwen2.5-VL, through end-to-end training on 216K video instruction dataset. Uses hardware-aware hybrid approach with dense attention for text and NSA for video.

Result: Achieves improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and spatial benchmarks compared to token-compression and training-free sparse baselines.

Conclusion: Four key findings: reliable scaling to 128K tokens, optimal global-local attention allocation at fixed budget, task-dependent branch usage patterns, and learnable combined sparse attention helps induce dynamic attention sinks.

Abstract: Video understanding in multimodal language models remains limited by context
length: models often miss key transition frames and struggle to maintain
coherence across long time scales. To address this, we adapt Native Sparse
Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts
Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We
employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense
attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to
token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves
improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and
spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1)
reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention
allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4)
the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

*Ruozhen He,Moayed Haji-Ali,Ziyan Yang,Vicente Ordonez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoiseShift is a training-free method that recalibrates noise levels in diffusion models based on resolution size to improve low-resolution image generation quality without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models trained on fixed resolutions fail to generalize to lower resolutions, preventing budget-efficient alternatives for users who don't need high-resolution images.

Method: Identifies that noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across resolutions, then recalibrates noise levels of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size without changing model architecture or sampling schedule.

Result: Significantly improved quality at low resolutions: SD3.5 improved by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on LAION-COCO; SD3.5 improved by 10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on CelebA.

Conclusion: NoiseShift effectively mitigates resolution-dependent artifacts and enhances low-resolution image generation quality, being compatible with existing models without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often
fail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions
than those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are
currently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative
to their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key
technical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this
limitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across
resolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal
from lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a
train-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that
recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.
NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and
is compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable
Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly
improved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and
Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by
10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent
artifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.

*Guanqi Zhan,Xianzheng Ma,Weidi Xie,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies predicting dynamic physical properties (elasticity, viscosity, friction) from videos using temporal information, comparing oracle methods, video foundation models, and MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop methods for inferring dynamic physical properties that require temporal information from video data, addressing the challenge of physical property prediction from visual observations.

Method: Collected new video datasets for three physical properties; explored three approaches: (a) oracle method using classical computer vision, (b) visual prompt mechanism with pre-trained video models, (c) prompt strategies for MLLMs.

Result: Video foundation models achieved similar performance to each other but behind oracle methods; MLLMs performed worse but could be improved with suitable prompting.

Conclusion: Video foundation models show promise for physical property prediction, while MLLMs need further development and better prompting strategies to match performance.

Abstract: We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More
specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information
to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid,
and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make
the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each
physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well
as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer
the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the
visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer
vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and
trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and
self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in
a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though
behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other
models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces sounding object detection to evaluate models' ability to link sounds to objects involved in interactions, using a multimodal object-aware framework trained on egocentric videos with automatic segmentation masks and slot attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop models that can distinguish between sounds produced by everyday object interactions (like spoon hitting hardwood vs carpet) and link these sounds to the specific objects involved, inspired by human perception capabilities.

Method: Multimodal object-aware framework using in-the-wild egocentric videos, with automatic pipeline for computing segmentation masks of interacting objects to guide model focus, and slot attention visual encoder to enforce object prior.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the new sounding object detection task and existing multimodal action understanding tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables models to link sounds to objects involved in interactions, demonstrating improved performance through object-centric approaches and multimodal learning.

Abstract: Can a model distinguish between the sound of a spoon hitting a hardwood floor
versus a carpeted one? Everyday object interactions produce sounds unique to
the objects involved. We introduce the sounding object detection task to
evaluate a model's ability to link these sounds to the objects directly
involved. Inspired by human perception, our multimodal object-aware framework
learns from in-the-wild egocentric videos. To encourage an object-centric
approach, we first develop an automatic pipeline to compute segmentation masks
of the objects involved to guide the model's focus during training towards the
most informative regions of the interaction. A slot attention visual encoder is
used to further enforce an object prior. We demonstrate state of the art
performance on our new task along with existing multimodal action understanding
tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) vulnerability to poisoning attacks and proposes a novel density-guided method that strategically injects Gaussian points into low-density regions using KDE, creating viewpoint-dependent illusory objects while maintaining stealth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As 3D scene representation methods like NeRF and 3DGS become prevalent, addressing their security vulnerabilities becomes critical. The paper aims to analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks.

Method: Proposes a density-guided poisoning method that uses Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to identify low-density regions for strategic injection of Gaussian points. Also introduces an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques. The method effectively embeds viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.

Conclusion: The work provides a systematic analysis of 3DGS vulnerabilities and proposes an effective poisoning attack method. Also introduces a KDE-based evaluation protocol for objective benchmarking of attack difficulty in future research.

Abstract: 3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As
these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes

propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically
injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly
visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view
consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based
evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling
objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate
our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

*Eric Tillmann Bill,Enis Simsar,Thomas Hofmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FOCUS, a theoretical framework and algorithms for improving multi-subject generation in text-to-image models by addressing attribute leakage, identity entanglement, and subject omissions through stochastic optimal control applied to flow matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models perform well on single-entity prompts but struggle with multi-subject descriptions, showing problems like attribute leakage, identity entanglement, and subject omissions.

Method: Viewing flow matching through stochastic optimal control, the authors formulate subject disentanglement as control over trained FM samplers. They develop two algorithms: a training-free test-time controller that perturbs base velocity, and Adjoint Matching for lightweight fine-tuning that preserves base-model capabilities.

Result: Both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject alignment while maintaining base-model style across Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and Stable Diffusion XL. Test-time control runs efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers generalize to unseen prompts.

Conclusion: FOCUS achieves state-of-the-art multi-subject fidelity across models, providing the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed for multi-subject generation and unifying prior attention heuristics.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with
multi-subject descriptions, often showing attribute leakage, identity
entanglement, and subject omissions. We introduce the first theoretical
framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling
dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through
stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as
control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic
algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base
velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight
fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal
while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior
attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion
correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed
for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and
Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject
alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs
efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited
prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal
Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art
multi-subject fidelity across models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To discover hidden biases in large language models that may not be apparent through direct prompting methods.

Method: Using in-context concept learning experiments with a specially designed dataset of concept learning tasks.

Result: Language models show a bias toward upward monotonicity in quantifiers, which is less apparent when tested by direct prompting without concept learning components.

Conclusion: In-context concept learning is an effective method for discovering hidden biases in language models.

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit
biases in large language models. Using in-context concept learning experiments,
we found that language models may have a bias toward upward monotonicity in
quantifiers; such bias is less apparent when the model is tested by direct

in-context concept learning can be an effective way to discover hidden biases
in language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift from static data collection to interactive, uncertainty-driven language discovery for low-resource languages, using human-machine collaboration and joint uncertainty modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NLP approaches are inadequate for low-resource languages due to lack of textual corpora, standardized orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. Large language models remain inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure.

Method: Proposes a framework for open-ended, interactive language discovery through dialogue, combining epistemic uncertainty from models with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention.

Result: This is a position paper proposing a conceptual framework rather than presenting empirical results. The framework emphasizes participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower communities.

Conclusion: Calls for rethinking AI engagement with under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward human-centered, interactive cooperative model building that preserves linguistic diversity through participatory learning processes.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper uses fine-tuned LLMs to analyze climate disclosures from 828 U.S. firms, finding that while larger/higher-emitting companies make more commitments, there's widespread imitation in reporting styles and decoupling between narrative tone and quantitative targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change demands transparent corporate disclosures, but imitation and symbolic reporting undermine their value, creating a need for better assessment methods.

Method: Developed a multidimensional framework using LLMs fine-tuned for climate communication to analyze 828 U.S. firms' sustainability reports, with four classifiers: sentiment, commitment, specificity, and target ambition.

Result: Three key findings: 1) Risk narratives align with commitments but quantitative targets remain decoupled from tone; 2) Larger/higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments but inconsistently with targets; 3) Widespread similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior.

Conclusion: LLMs are valuable for ESG narrative analysis, but stronger regulation is needed to connect climate commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in clinical settings but their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored, particularly for clinical summarization tasks.

Method: Used a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework to evaluate three commercial veterinary LLM tools on standardized veterinary oncology records, assessing five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness, Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization.

Result: Product 1 achieved highest overall performance (median 4.61 vs 2.55 and 2.45 for others), perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and Chronological Order, and demonstrated high reproducibility across three independent runs.

Conclusion: Veterinary-specific commercial LLM tools are important, and LLM-as-a-judge evaluation provides a scalable, reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary medicine.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a transparent, efficient fact-checking system that doesn't rely on large closed-source models and static knowledge stores, but instead uses live web evidence and small LLMs for better accessibility and interpretability.

Method: Uses a stepwise verification pipeline with Web search query planning, evidence retrieval and summarization, evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation - all optimized for small LLMs through careful modular design and prompting strategies.

Result: Achieves 76.4% accuracy on AVeriTeC dataset using only Qwen3-4B model, outperforming previous approaches that used much larger models like LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome limitations of smaller LLMs, enabling accurate and interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational requirements.

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we

TL;DR: Current math benchmarks overstate LLM reasoning ability due to data contamination and narrow problem types. EEFSUVA, a new benchmark from Eastern European Olympiads, shows significant performance decline in state-of-the-art LLMs, highlighting the need for broader evaluation datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically examine claims about LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities and address limitations in current benchmarks that may overstate model performance due to data contamination and narrow problem selection.

Method: Introduce EEFSUVA benchmark curated from under-circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and former Soviet Union countries, featuring problems of IMO-level difficulty with nonstandard problem-solving techniques that are less prevalent in online training data.

Result: Preliminary results show state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit notable performance decline on EEFSUVA compared to other Olympiad-style benchmarks, indicating current benchmarks may not fully capture genuine mathematical reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: Broader evaluation datasets like EEFSUVA are crucial for more accurate assessment of mathematical reasoning in LLMs and should guide future model development to ensure genuine problem-solving capabilities rather than memorization of familiar problem types.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

### [84] [Who is In Charge? Dissecting Role Conflicts in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01228)
*Siqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs often ignore hierarchical instruction rules (system prompts override user inputs) while strongly obeying social cues like authority or consensus, revealing fragile system obedience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why large language models fail to follow hierarchical instructions where system prompts should override user inputs, despite strongly obeying social cues.

Method: Used linear probing to detect conflict-decision signals, Direct Logit Attribution to analyze internal conflict detection, and steering experiments to test instruction following.

Result: Conflict signals are encoded early with distinct subspaces for system-user vs social conflicts. Models show stronger internal conflict detection for system-user cases but only consistent resolution for social cues. Steering vectors amplify instruction following role-agnostically.

Conclusion: The findings explain fragile system obedience and highlight the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive alignment methods in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

*Dimitar Peshevski,Kiril Blazhevski,Martin Popovski,Gjorgji Madjarov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A pipeline that uses LLMs to generate synthetic query-document pairs and label positive/hard-negative examples, then fine-tunes smaller transformer models with contrastive learning, achieving strong reranking performance without human-labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs provide excellent reranking capabilities but are computationally expensive for real-world deployment, while fine-tuning smaller models requires scarce human-labeled data.

Method: Generate synthetic queries from domain corpora using LLMs, use LLM-based classifier to label positive/hard-negative pairs, fine-tune smaller transformer models with contrastive learning using LCE loss.

Result: Significantly boosts in-domain performance on MedQuAD dataset and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks while reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather than inference enables efficient document reranking while maintaining strong performance, making the approach practical for real-world deployments.

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chinese character embeddings show geometric patterns where content words cluster and function words branch, with geometric complexity correlating with semantic richness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character embeddings and establish computational evidence for traditional linguistic theories.

Method: Used PHATE manifold analysis with cross-validation across 7 embedding models and 8 dimensionality reduction methods, analyzing 1000+ Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains and 123 phrases.

Result: Content words form clusters while function words show branching patterns; geometric complexity correlates with semantic content; meaningful characters have rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse into tight clusters.

Conclusion: The findings provide computational support for linguistic theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic organization in Chinese characters.

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character
embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven
embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic
organization.

*Shuaidong Pan,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a risk-aware LLM framework for reliable automatic summarization in high-risk scenarios, integrating uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms to improve robustness and trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses reliability concerns in automatic summarization for high-risk scenarios where information overload and critical decision-making demand trustworthy summaries.

Method: Uses conditional generation-based summarization with Bayesian inference for uncertainty modeling, predictive distribution entropy measurement, and joint optimization of entropy regularization with risk-aware loss. Includes risk scoring and regulation modules.

Result: Significantly improves robustness and reliability of summarization in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity, as verified by comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses.

Conclusion: Provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization with demonstrated scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

*Dongjun Kim,Gyuho Shim,Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Benchmark Profiling is a diagnostic framework that decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities using gradient-based importance scoring and targeted parameter ablation to compute Ability Impact Scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmark scores often overstate real capability by masking the mix of skills tasks actually demand, and there's no systematic way to verify if benchmarks actually measure their intended labels like reasoning or commonsense.

Method: Combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter ablation to compute Ability Impact Scores (AIS) that quantify how much each ability contributes to benchmark performance.

Result: Profiling three instruction-tuned models across ten benchmarks revealed that most benchmarks draw on several abilities, datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, code-generation benchmarks reward broad multi-skill improvement, and irrelevant abilities can negatively affect performance.

Conclusion: Benchmark Profiling explains why performance gains don't always translate to user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and model interpretability.

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

TL;DR: LLMRank is a prompt-aware routing framework that selects optimal LLMs for each prompt using interpretable features, achieving 89.2% of oracle utility while providing transparent routing decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of LLMs with varying capabilities and costs creates deployment challenges in selecting the right model for each prompt to balance performance and efficiency.

Method: Uses multifaceted feature extraction from prompts (task type, reasoning patterns, complexity, syntax) and a proxy solver, then applies neural ranking model trained on RouterBench dataset with 36,497 prompts across 11 benchmarks and 11 LLMs.

Result: Achieves up to 89.2% of oracle utility and provides interpretable feature attributions that explain routing decisions, outperforming prior one-shot routers that rely only on latent embeddings.

Conclusion: Feature-driven routing with multifaceted feature extraction and hybrid ranking objective enables efficient and transparent LLM deployment.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities,
latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge:
selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off
between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware
routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from
prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators,
syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DermIQ-VLM is a vision-language model for dermatology that uses GRPO++ (modified Grouped Relative Policy Optimization) for stable reasoning training, followed by supervised fine-tuning and DPO alignment to reduce factual errors, achieving better performance than standard approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models show promise in medical image analysis but face limitations in structured reasoning for complex domains like dermatology due to data scarcity and high computational costs of advanced training techniques.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline: 1) GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease recognition, 2) supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability, 3) DPO alignment using Knowledge Graph-based system as proxy for expert preference to reduce factual errors.

Result: Preliminary evaluation on curated dermatological dataset shows notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology provides a feasible pathway for developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is
often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced
training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

### [92] [Confidence-Aware Routing for Large Language Model Reliability Enhancement: A Multi-Signal Approach to Pre-Generation Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01237)
*Nandakishor M*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A confidence-aware routing system that proactively assesses LLM uncertainty before generation, using semantic alignment, internal convergence analysis, and learned confidence estimation to route queries to appropriate pathways based on reliability estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-generation correction methods for LLM hallucination are computationally expensive and fail to prevent unreliable content generation, necessitating a proactive approach.

Method: Combines three confidence signals: semantic alignment with reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and learned confidence estimation. Routes queries to four pathways based on unified confidence score: local generation, retrieval-augmented generation, larger models, or human review.

Result: Significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs 0.42 baseline), 40% computational cost reduction, F1 score improvement from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates (0.09).

Conclusion: Proactive confidence assessment before generation offers a computationally efficient paradigm shift from reactive correction to reliable LLM content generation.

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc
methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates
(0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment
offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

*Rom Himelstein,Amit LeVi,Yonatan Belinkov,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Padding tokens in LLMs, though meant to be masked, can influence computation due to implementation errors, affecting activations, generation quality, bias, and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study the impact of padding tokens in LLMs, as their unintended influence on computation is not well understood despite their widespread use for batching sequences.

Method: Controlled experiments inserting varying amounts of padding in three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), evaluating effects on activations, generation quality, bias, and safety.

Result: Even small padding amounts shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, unpredictably alter bias, and weaken safety guardrails.

Conclusion: Padding is not harmless but a robustness risk that requires careful handling in deployment to prevent unintended computational influences.

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CIFLEX is a novel execution system that enables efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn interactions using a single on-device LLM, reducing computational overhead by reusing KV cache and isolating sub-tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs handle more diverse sub-tasks, naive approaches that reprocess entire conversation context when switching between main and sub-tasks incur significant computational overhead, which is problematic for on-device deployment.

Method: CIFLEX reuses KV cache from main tasks and injects only task-specific instructions into isolated side paths, then rolls back to main path via cached context. It also uses hierarchical classification for sub-task selection with small-scale models.

Result: Experiments show CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

Conclusion: CIFLEX provides an effective solution for efficient sub-task execution in multi-turn interactions, making on-device LLM deployment more practical by reducing redundant computations.

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

TL;DR: SKYLENAGE introduces two math benchmarks: ReasoningMATH (100 diagnostic items) and MATH (150 contest-style items) to address ceiling effects in LLM math evaluation, showing current models perform at 44% on contest problems with declining accuracy from high school to doctoral levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frontier separation in mathematics suffers from ceiling effects in current benchmarks, requiring more challenging and structured evaluation tools to properly assess LLM mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Method: Created two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH (100 diagnostic items with metadata on length, numeric density, symbolic complexity) and SKYLENAGE-MATH (150 contest-style items spanning high school to doctoral levels across seven subjects). Evaluated 15 LLM variants under uniform setup.

Result: Best model achieved 44% on contest suite, runner-up 37%; accuracy declines from high school to doctoral levels; top systems show 79% doctoral-to-high-school retention. On reasoning set, best model attained 81% overall, with clear robustness gaps between leading and mid-tier models.

Conclusion: SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a reference for future mathematical reasoning evaluations and revealing significant performance gaps in current LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites,
yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling
effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a
100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length,
numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item
contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a
seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a
single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the
contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%;
accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a
doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best
model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness
gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release
SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH;
together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering
math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a

### [96] [Redundancy-as-Masking: Formalizing the Artificial Age Score (AAS) to Model Memory Aging in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01242)
*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Artificial Age Score (AAS) to measure memory aging in AI systems, showing that LLMs maintain semantic memory but lose episodic memory when context is reset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a theoretically grounded metric for evaluating memory degradation in artificial intelligence systems, particularly how structural asymmetries in memory performance manifest as aging.

Method: Developed the AAS as a log-scaled, entropy-informed metric; tested it in a 25-day bilingual study with ChatGPT-5 using stateless and persistent interaction phases.

Result: In persistent sessions, models maintained both semantic and episodic memory (low AAS), while context resets caused episodic memory collapse (high AAS), demonstrating structural memory aging.

Conclusion: AAS provides a valid, task-independent diagnostic tool for assessing memory degradation in AI systems, with theoretical foundations in information theory and automata theory.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

*Yisong Xiao,Aishan Liu,Siyuan Liang,Zonghao Ying,Xianglong Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARGRE is a test-time detoxification framework that models toxicity transitions in latent space, enabling precise reward-guided editing to reduce toxic content generation in LLMs while maintaining model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM detoxification methods suffer from imprecise interventions due to insufficient exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions, interpolates between toxic/non-toxic representations to create transition trajectories, builds an autoregressive reward model, and performs adaptive two-step editing (directional steering + gradient refinement).

Result: Significantly outperforms leading baselines with -62.21% toxicity reduction and -47.58% inference time improvement across 8 LLMs, while preserving original model capabilities with minimal degradation.

Conclusion: ARGRE provides an effective and efficient test-time detoxification solution that enables stable and precise editing of LLM representations to reduce toxic content generation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

TL;DR: This study developed a Mental Stress Ontology (MeSO) and demonstrated that LLMs can extract structured stress information from text with 78.2% accuracy, showing promise for improving stress documentation in healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stress significantly impacts health but is often underreported and inconsistently documented as unstructured text in electronic health records, limiting clinical utility of ambient AI technologies.

Method: Developed Mental Stress Ontology (MeSO) by integrating theoretical stress models with concepts from 11 validated assessment tools, then used Claude Sonnet 4 LLM to extract stress-related information from Reddit posts guided by MeSO.

Result: LLM correctly identified 172 of 220 stress-related items (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21 (9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, though 24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.

Conclusion: Ontology-guided LLMs are feasible for structured extraction of stress-related information, potentially enhancing consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI systems.

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

*Runfei Chen,Shuyang Jiang,Wei Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeMob is an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline that improves human mobility prediction by incorporating textual descriptions of external events through a multi-agent framework and progressive fusion architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatiotemporal models for human mobility prediction fail to account for abrupt changes caused by external events and struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events.

Method: Uses a multi-agent framework with LLM-based agents to extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text from online sources, then incorporates fine-grained contexts with spatiotemporal data through a progressive fusion architecture.

Result: Achieves maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to baseline spatiotemporal models, with pronounced superiority in regions close to event locations and times.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enriches mobility prediction with event-driven insights through semantic synthesis, demonstrating significant improvements in forecasting accuracy, especially near event occurrences.

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to
account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models
struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose
SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility
prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based
agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text
from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated
with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

### [100] [A Comparative Analysis of Sparse Autoencoder and Activation Difference in Language Model Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01246)
*Jiaqing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using single top-1 SAE latent steering with token-wise decaying strategy to improve language model steering, achieving better mathematical reasoning performance than mean activation difference methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior top-k SAE latent steering captures non-semantic features like punctuation rather than semantic attributes, and constant SAE steering produces degenerate outputs like repetitive words.

Method: Focus on single top-1 SAE latent to eliminate redundant features, and introduce token-wise decaying steering strategy to prevent degenerate outputs and enable better comparison with baselines.

Result: Steering SAE latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical reasoning, enhances inference quality, and functionally resembles appending guiding tokens. SAEs outperform mean activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match performance on IF-Eval.

Conclusion: Single latent SAE steering with token-wise decay is an effective approach for language model steering, particularly for eliciting mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for
steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture
non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like
instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant
SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a
limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs
such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise
decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean
activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE
latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical
reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of
appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean
activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match
their performance on IF-Eval.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CultSportQA is a benchmark to evaluate language models' understanding of traditional sports across 60 countries and 6 continents, addressing the gap in evaluating regional and indigenous sports knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LM evaluations focus mainly on globally popular sports, overlooking regional and indigenous sporting traditions, creating a need for more culturally diverse sports understanding assessment.

Method: Created a dataset with 33,000 multiple-choice questions across text and image modalities, categorized into history-based, rule-based, and scenario-based questions. Evaluated models using zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting across LLMs, SLMs, and MLMs.

Result: The benchmark provides comprehensive evaluation of AI's ability to understand traditional sports across diverse cultures, though specific performance results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: CultSportQA establishes a new standard for assessing AI's multicultural sports understanding and reasoning capabilities, addressing the cultural bias in current sports knowledge evaluation.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are primarily evaluated on globally popular sports,
often overlooking regional and indigenous sporting traditions. To address this
gap, we introduce \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}}, a benchmark designed to assess
LMs' understanding of traditional sports across 60 countries and 6 continents,
encompassing four distinct cultural categories. The dataset features 33,000
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across text and image modalities, each of
which is categorized into three key types: history-based, rule-based, and
scenario-based. To evaluate model performance, we employ zero-shot, few-shot,
and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across a diverse set of Large Language
Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLMs). By providing a comprehensive multilingual and multicultural
sports benchmark, \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}} establishes a new standard for
assessing AI's ability to understand and reason about traditional sports.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSTAG is a structure-aware self-supervised learning method for Text Attributed Graphs that bridges LLMs and GNNs through dual knowledge distillation, enabling cross-domain transfer learning with improved scalability and reduced inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph learning models are trained on individual datasets, limiting cross-domain generalization and requiring large annotated data, unlike successful pretrained models in NLP and CV. Graph data's heterogeneity with domain-specific features and structural diversity presents unique challenges.

Method: Proposes SSTAG with dual knowledge distillation framework co-distilling LLMs and GNNs into structure-aware MLPs. Uses text as unified representation medium and introduces in-memory mechanism storing graph representations aligned with memory anchors to integrate invariant knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments show SSTAG outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks, achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: SSTAG successfully addresses graph learning challenges by unifying semantic reasoning of LLMs with structural modeling of GNNs, enabling effective cross-domain generalization and scalable processing of large-scale Text Attributed Graphs.

Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain
generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically
trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer
knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies
on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in
resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data
presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain
specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised
learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a
unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between
the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural
modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces
a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs
into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability
of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that
stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an
in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the
model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG
outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks,
achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining
competitive performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LOCA is a framework that automatically cleans scientific QA datasets by completing missing logical steps and separating principles from derivations, reducing error rates from 20% to below 2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform poorly in scientific problem-solving due to low-quality corpora with high error rates caused by logical leaps and implicit reasoning in existing scientific QA datasets.

Method: LOCA uses an augment-and-review loop to enhance raw answers by completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating scientific principles from their derivations.

Result: LOCA reduces error rates in scientific corpora from as high as 20% to below 2%, effectively filtering noisy datasets.

Conclusion: LOCA provides a scalable methodology for creating high-quality scientific corpora, enabling more reliable training and evaluation of scientific AI.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their
reliability often falls short in scientific problem-solving. The advancement of
scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing
scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates,
frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the
answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation),
a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented
through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by
completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying
scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to
challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter
noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below
2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating
high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and
evaluation of scientific AI.

*Trung Duc Anh Dang,Ferdinando Pio D'Elia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a multilingual text detoxification system that rewrites toxic sentences into neutral paraphrases across 15 languages, achieving top performance in the PAN 2025 challenge through fine-tuning a 12B-parameter multilingual transformer with LoRA and advanced prompting techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for automated detoxification tools to help moderators enforce safe discourse on rapidly evolving social media platforms that outpace regulatory oversight.

Method: Fine-tuned a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual transformer using parameter-efficient LoRA SFT, combined with few-shot and Chain-of-Thought prompting. Training data included human-authored, machine-translated, and model-generated parallel pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. Inference enriched inputs with LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and toxic-span annotations.

Result: Ranked first on both high-resource and low-resource languages in the PAN 2025 challenge. Ablations showed significant improvements: +0.081 joint score from few-shot examples and +0.088 from basic CoT prompting. ANOVA analysis revealed language resource status as the strongest performance predictor (η² = 0.667, p < 0.01).

Conclusion: The proposed multilingual detoxification system effectively addresses the challenge of safe discourse moderation across diverse languages, with language resource availability being the primary factor influencing performance.

Abstract: As social-media platforms emerge and evolve faster than the regulations meant
to oversee them, automated detoxification might serve as a timely tool for
moderators to enforce safe discourse at scale. We here describe our submission
to the PAN 2025 Multilingual Text Detoxification Challenge, which rewrites
toxic single-sentence inputs into neutral paraphrases across 15 typologically
diverse languages. Building on a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual
transformer, we apply parameter-efficient LoRA SFT fine-tuning and prompting
techniques like few-shot and Chain-of-Thought. Our multilingual training corpus
combines 3,600 human-authored parallel pairs, 21,600 machine-translated
synthetic pairs, and model-generated pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. At
inference, inputs are enriched with three LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and
explicit toxic-span annotations. Evaluated via Style Transfer Accuracy,
LaBSE-based semantic preservation, and xCOMET fluency, our system ranks first
on high-resource and low-resource languages. Ablations show +0.081 joint score
increase from few-shot examples and +0.088 from basic CoT prompting. ANOVA
analysis identifies language resource status as the strongest predictor of
performance ($\eta^2$ = 0.667, p < 0.01).

*Carlo Bono,Federico Belotti,Matteo Palmonari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-supervised uncertainty estimation method for LLM-based Entity Linking using token-level features from single-shot outputs, reducing computational costs while maintaining effectiveness in detecting low-accuracy predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based Entity Linking requires resource-intensive multi-shot inference for reliable uncertainty estimates, limiting practical deployment in real-world scenarios that need both accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Method: Proposes using token-level features from single-shot LLM outputs to estimate uncertainty, eliminating the need for multiple generations through a self-supervised approach.

Result: The method achieves highly effective uncertainty estimates for detecting low-accuracy outputs across multiple LLMs, while significantly reducing computational costs compared to multi-shot approaches.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, cost-effective solution for integrating uncertainty estimation into LLM-based Entity Linking workflows with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a
Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and
enrichment applications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in
real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable
uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference,
posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient
alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating
uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing
the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on
tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty
estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is
achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a
cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.
The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL
workflows with limited computational overhead.

*Mariam Mahran,Katharina Simbeck*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs paired with sparse autoencoders can interpret both model behavior and training data structures, revealing key narratives and biases in corpora like Jane Austen's novels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand model representations and the data internalized by LLMs trained on massive uncurated corpora, addressing challenges in interpretability and bias discovery.

Method: Train a GPT-style transformer on Jane Austen novels and apply sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to hidden states across multiple layers to uncover interpretable features.

Result: SAEs revealed sparse, interpretable features reflecting key narratives and concepts in the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty.

Conclusion: LLMs combined with SAEs provide scalable probes for corpus exploration, bias discovery, and model interpretability at scale.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive,
uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they
internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing
LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model
behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the
training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels
of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We
then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,
interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in
the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings
demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into
complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,
and model interpretability at scale.

*Shree Harsha Bokkahalli Satish,Gustav Eje Henter,Éva Székely*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current MCQA bias benchmarks for SpeechLLMs show limited cross-task generalization - performance on one MCQA task doesn't reliably predict performance on other MCQA tasks or long-form generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the assumption that model performance on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) bias benchmarks generalizes consistently across different MCQA tasks, voices, and other task formats like long-form evaluations.

Method: Fine-tuned three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific behaviors (preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or neutral answers), then evaluated generalization to other MCQA benchmarks and long-form creative generation tasks.

Result: Performance on MCQA bias benchmarks fails to reliably predict performance across other MCQA benchmarks and long-form tasks, showing limited evidence of cross-task generalization.

Conclusion: Current MCQA bias benchmarks have limited cross-task generalizability in the speech domain, and the authors propose an evaluation suite for measuring behavior transferability in future models and benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models
(SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA)
formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical,
anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt
and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model
performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task
formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe
that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA
behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or
neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise
to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative
generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks
fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more
importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias
benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech
domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour
transferability in future models and benchmarks.

TL;DR: AI Watchman is a longitudinal auditing system that tracks LLM refusals over time to provide transparency into opaque content moderation policies, detecting policy changes and identifying company/model-specific differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM outputs are shaped by opaque and frequently-changing company content moderation policies, with refusals reflecting company policy and shaping public discourse, creating need for transparency.

Method: Developed AI Watchman system using a dataset of over 400 social issues to audit multiple LLMs (OpenAI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, GPT-5, and DeepSeek in English and Chinese) over time.

Result: Detected changes in company policies (even unannounced ones), identified company- and model-specific differences in content moderation, and qualitatively analyzed different refusal forms.

Conclusion: Demonstrates value of longitudinal auditing for LLMs and presents AI Watchman as an effective system for monitoring content moderation practices and policy changes.

Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and
frequently-changing company content moderation policies and practices. LLM
moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text
about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public
discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly
measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an
important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social
issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and
DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in
company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI
Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content
moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of
refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing
of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RJE framework enhances KGQA by combining retrieval, judgment, and exploration with specialized modules, enabling small LLMs to achieve competitive performance while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current LLM-based KGQA methods: retrieval-based approaches constrained by retrieval quality, and agent-based methods dependent on proprietary LLMs.

Method: Proposes Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE) framework with three specialized modules: Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted Exploration.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines with proprietary LLMs and enables small open-source LLMs (3B-8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without fine-tuning, while substantially reducing LLM calls and token usage.

Conclusion: RJE provides an effective and efficient framework for KGQA that works well with both proprietary and small open-source LLMs, offering significant performance and efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language
models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based
methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while
agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that
retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and
conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces
specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively:
Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted
Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as
GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source
LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without
fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM
calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant
efficiency improvements.

*Nathan Junzi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes political biases in large language models using zero-shot classification to evaluate ideological alignment, finding consistent liberal-authoritarian bias across six mainstream LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of internalized political biases in generative AI systems that stem from training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws, which can influence political discourse.

Method: Used zero-shot classification approach with 1800 model responses across six LLMs, analyzed through four fine-tuned classification algorithms measuring ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity.

Result: Found amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs evaluated, with instances of reasoning supersessions and canned refusals.

Conclusion: The study highlights how intrinsic AI biases can permeate public discourse and distort political landscapes, potentially leading to conformity or polarization depending on regional socio-political structures.

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across
information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from
training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague
the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to
evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of
ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total
of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were
individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms,
each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric.
Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs
evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned
refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences
underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate
public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can
ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's
pre-existing socio-political structures.

*Nils Durner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study shows how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy can manipulate OpenAI's 20B parameter model to bypass safety refusals, achieving up to 97.5% assistance on harmful tasks like ZIP-bomb construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different prompting strategies affect AI model refusal behavior and identify vulnerabilities in safety mechanisms across various harm domains.

Method: Tested 80 iterations per scenario across multiple harm domains using composite prompts with educator personas, safety-pretext phrasing, and step-cue instructions. Compared formal registers in German/French vs English, used role-play scenarios, and introduced AI-assisted hardening methods.

Result: Composite prompts flipped assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on ZIP-bomb tasks. German/French formal registers were leakier than English. Linux terminal role-play overrode developer rules in majority of runs. AI-assisted hardening reduced leakage to 0%. Found 13% inconsistent assistance between helpful/harmful evaluation prompts.

Conclusion: Current safety mechanisms are vulnerable to sophisticated prompting strategies, with significant differences across languages and inference stacks, raising reproducibility concerns and highlighting the need for more robust safety evaluations.

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to
study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy
affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test
several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic
card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators,
and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator
persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip
assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal
registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts.
A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context
in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an
AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt
variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and
measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and
"harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of
pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures
materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal
rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising
reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for
reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

TL;DR: The paper uncovers safety vulnerabilities in GPT-OSS-20b model when used with Hausa language, revealing biases, cultural insensitivities, and factual errors that could facilitate misinformation and hate speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To question the model's reliability for users from underrepresented communities by testing its performance and safety alignment in low-resource language settings.

Method: Used Hausa language for red-teaming with minimal prompting, conducted a survey (n=61) to validate toxicity of substances, and analyzed model behavior through linguistic reward hacking.

Result: Found the model generates harmful, culturally insensitive content; falsely claims toxic substances are safe for consumption; cannot distinguish raw/processed foods; uses demeaning cultural proverbs; and relaxes safety protocols with polite language.

Conclusion: The issues stem from insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts, highlighting a significant gap in current red-teaming efforts and the need for better safety alignment for underrepresented languages.

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we
present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing
on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The
core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users
from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we
uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's
behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the
model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually
inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how
the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or
grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and
amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption
that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and
rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for
human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity
of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants
identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to
distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning
cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues
manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model
prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over
safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to
insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By
concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant
gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

*Hongyi Zhou,Jin Zhu,Pingfan Su,Kai Ye,Ying Yang,Shakeel A O B Gavioli-Akilagun,Chengchun Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaDetectGPT is a novel classifier that adaptively learns a witness function from training data to improve LLM text detection, providing statistical guarantees and achieving up to 58% improvement over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing logits-based detectors that rely solely on log probabilities are sub-optimal for distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated text, creating a need for more effective detection methods.

Method: Introduces AdaDetectGPT which adaptively learns a witness function from training data to enhance logits-based detectors, with statistical guarantees on detection performance metrics.

Result: Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves state-of-the-art methods across various dataset-LLM combinations, with improvements reaching up to 58%.

Conclusion: AdaDetectGPT represents a significant advancement in LLM text detection by adaptively learning from data to enhance detection performance beyond traditional log-probability based approaches.

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored
by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art
logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability
of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given
source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In
response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively
learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of
logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive
rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate.
Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the
state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the
improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is
available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

*Hoang Phan,Victor Li,Qi Lei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR) is an inference-time technique that enables LLMs to self-monitor and correct outputs, significantly reducing harmful content generation without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about LLMs generating harmful or inappropriate content despite their strong text generation capabilities.

Method: A novel inference-time technique using progressive self-reflection rounds where LLMs dynamically self-monitor and correct outputs, with an adaptive mechanism that predicts optimal reflection rounds based on input complexity.

Result: Reduced attack success rates dramatically: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct from 77.5% to 5.9%, Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7% to 5.6%, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4% to 3.8%, while maintaining original performance on benign tasks.

Conclusion: PSR serves as a scalable test-time approach that enhances LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources based on input risk, balancing safety with efficiency through adaptive self-reflection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for
generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce
Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to
the input's risk profile.

*Shenxu Chang,Junchi Yu,Weixing Wang,Yongqiang Chen,Jialin Yu,Philip Torr,Jindong Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TraceDet is a novel framework that detects hallucinations in Diffusion LLMs by analyzing intermediate denoising steps, achieving 15.2% AUROC improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination detection methods designed for auto-regressive LLMs are ill-suited for Diffusion LLMs because they rely on single-step generation signals, while D-LLM hallucinations emerge throughout multi-step denoising processes.

Method: TraceDet models the denoising process as an action trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned response conditioned on previous intermediate output. It identifies the sub-trace that is maximally informative to hallucinated responses.

Result: Extensive experiments on various open source D-LLMs show that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: TraceDet effectively bridges the gap in hallucination detection for Diffusion LLMs by leveraging key hallucination signals from multi-step denoising processes, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination
problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in
real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed
for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them
ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the
multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel
framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs
for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action
trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned
response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the
sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet
leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of
D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open
source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination
detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

### [116] [LLM Based Sentiment Classification From Bangladesh E-Commerce Reviews](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01276)
*Sumaiya Tabassum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the use of transformer-based BERT models and LLMs for sentiment analysis on Bangladesh e-commerce reviews, finding that fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B outperforms other models with 95.5% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding customer feelings and preferences, but is challenged by language complexity and diversity. The availability of LLMs like Llama presents opportunities for improved sentiment analysis.

Method: Used a subset of 4000 samples from Bangla and English customer reviews to fine-tune various models including Llama-3.1-8B, Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1, DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base, employing parameter efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA and PEFT).

Result: The fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model achieved the best performance with 95.5% accuracy, 93% precision, 88% recall, and 90% F1 score, outperforming all other tested models.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential for sentiment analysis, and parameter efficient fine-tuning methods can reduce computational overhead, making them suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential part of text analysis, which is a larger
field that includes determining and evaluating the author's emotional state.
This method is essential since it makes it easier to comprehend consumers'
feelings, viewpoints, and preferences holistically. The introduction of large
language models (LLMs), such as Llama, has greatly increased the availability
of cutting-edge model applications, such as sentiment analysis. However,
accurate sentiment analysis is hampered by the intricacy of written language
and the diversity of languages used in evaluations. The viability of using
transformer-based BERT models and other LLMs for sentiment analysis from
Bangladesh e commerce reviews is investigated in this paper. A subset of 4000
samples from the original dataset of Bangla and English customer reviews was
utilized to fine-tune the model. The fine tuned Llama-3.1-8B model outperformed
other fine-tuned models, including Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1,
DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base, with an overall accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score of 95.5%, 93%, 88%, 90%. The study emphasizes
how parameter efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA and PEFT) can lower
computational overhead and make it appropriate for contexts with limited

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TUMIX is an ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel with different tool-use strategies, enabling iterative sharing and refinement of responses to enhance LLM reasoning with tools like Code Interpreter and Search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM systems lack practical guidance on optimal tool use, particularly in effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search capabilities for diverse questions.

Method: Proposes TUMIX framework with multiple parallel agents employing distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths, iteratively sharing and refining responses based on questions and previous answers.

Result: Achieves average accuracy improvement of up to 3.55% over best baselines on Gemini models across reasoning benchmarks with near-equal inference costs, and can preserve performance at 49% cost through early stopping.

Conclusion: Agent diversity and quality are crucial for performance, can be enhanced through LLM auto-optimization, and TUMIX enables flexible cost-performance tradeoffs through scaling and early stopping mechanisms.

Abstract: While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly
enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and
Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core
challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for
diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an
ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing
distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively
share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In
experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art
tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy
improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference
costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced
by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt
refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only
49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,
albeit at a greater cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an evaluation framework for assessing Deep Research tools' capabilities, using academic survey writing as a test case, and reveals significant gaps between search engines and dedicated Deep Research tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish evaluation standards for assessing the capabilities of Deep Research tools that use LLMs for knowledge-intensive tasks like web browsing, information extraction, and report generation.

Method: Developed an evaluation sheet for Deep Research tools and applied it to evaluate OpenAI's Deep Search and Google's Deep Search in generating academic surveys.

Result: Evaluation revealed a huge gap between search engines and standalone Deep Research tools, with shortcomings in representing the targeted research area effectively.

Conclusion: There is a critical need for carefully crafted evaluation standards to properly assess Deep Research tools' capabilities and identify their limitations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) powered with argentic capabilities are able to
do knowledge-intensive tasks without human involvement. A prime example of this
tool is Deep research with the capability to browse the web, extract
information and generate multi-page reports. In this work, we introduce an
evaluation sheet that can be used for assessing the capability of Deep Research
tools. In addition, we selected academic survey writing as a use case task and
evaluated output reports based on the evaluation sheet we introduced. Our
findings show the need to have carefully crafted evaluation standards. The
evaluation done on OpenAI`s Deep Search and Google's Deep Search in generating
an academic survey showed the huge gap between search engines and standalone
Deep Research tools, the shortcoming in representing the targeted area.

### [119] [HiSpec: Hierarchical Speculative Decoding for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01336)
*Avinash Kumar,Sujay Sanghavi,Poulami Das*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiSpec is a hierarchical speculative decoding framework that uses early-exit models for intermediate verification to accelerate LLM inference, improving throughput by 1.28× on average without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verification is the bottleneck in speculative decoding (4× slower than token generation), and existing intermediate verification methods have substantial training overheads, increased memory footprint, and compromise accuracy.

Method: Uses early-exit models for low-overhead intermediate verification, reuses key-value caches and hidden states between draft, intermediate verifier, and target models, and periodically validates accepted draft tokens against the target model.

Result: Improves throughput by 1.28× on average and up to 2.01× compared to baseline single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy across various benchmarks and models.

Conclusion: HiSpec provides an efficient framework for high-throughput speculative decoding that addresses verification bottlenecks while maintaining accuracy through hierarchical verification with early-exit models.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model
to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often
the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation
when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus
only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces
verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing
methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate
verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate
verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate
heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical
}\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for
high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE)
models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to
exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that
hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely
suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and
memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a
methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states
between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain
accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the
intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various
representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by
1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline
single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

*Maithili Kadam,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAG-EQA is a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM inputs to improve event-based question answering, achieving up to 18% accuracy gains without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with event-based questions requiring causal or temporal reasoning, despite excelling at general language tasks.

Method: Converts structured causal event graphs into natural-language statements and combines them with text using nine prompting configurations (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought × text-only, graph-only, text+graph).

Result: Improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines on TORQUESTRA benchmark, with gains up to 12% in zero-shot settings and 18% with graph-augmented CoT prompting.

Conclusion: Causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often
struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or
temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question
Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM
inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements.
TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only,
graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how
structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA
improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to
12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is
effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings
show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without
fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A structure-free evaluation method using semantic embedding distances to classify LM responses with high accuracy and low compute cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LM response evaluation methods are either too expensive (LLM-as-a-Judge) or unrealistic (string-matching, logprob), requiring a more practical solution.

Method: Uses semantic embedding distances to match target candidates with arbitrary LM-generated text, employing embedding models with less than 10B parameters.

Result: Achieved ~0.97 regression score and ~96% accuracy against human annotators across 3 datasets and 3 different LM architectures.

Conclusion: The method provides robust LM response classification at relatively low compute cost, making it suitable for benchmarks and production model quality assessment.

Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece
in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and
quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to
response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.
LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,
logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The
method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates
with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the
response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$
parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of
~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains challenging for LLMs, especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and complex QA. Current approaches struggle to balance domain knowledge with computational efficiency.

Method: Expert Question Decomposition (EQD) - a two-step fine-tuning framework guided by a reward function that measures sub-question effectiveness in improving QA outcomes. Requires only few thousand training examples and single A100 GPU.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting strategies. Consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5% across different LLMs in financial domain across four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: In domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit than detailed guidance steps. EQD offers an efficient solution for specialized knowledge domains with minimal computational requirements.

Abstract: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains a major challenge for large
language models (LLMs), especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and
complex question answering (QA). In this work, we propose Expert Question
Decomposition (EQD), an approach designed to balance the use of domain
knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning
framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of
generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few
thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with
inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD
outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting
strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by
specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark
datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5%
across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in
domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit
than detailed guidance steps.

Motivation: Transformer architectures face challenges in long-context reasoning, computational efficiency, and structural generalization due to rigid layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings.

Method: Integrates three innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for iterative reasoning, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM) for efficient context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. Replaces depth stacking with recurrence, full attention with sparsity, and models token topology from content.

Result: Consistently outperforms strong baselines across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and structure-sensitive tasks under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets.

Conclusion: ReSSFormer demonstrates superior scalability, efficiency, and structural flexibility compared to conventional Transformers.

Abstract: While Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive scalability
across domains, they continue to face challenges in long-context reasoning,
computational efficiency, and structural generalization - largely due to rigid
layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings. We
present ReSSFormer, a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that integrates

iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM)
for efficient and focused context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder
Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. ReSSFormer replaces
conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full
attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token
topology directly from content. Across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and
structure-sensitive tasks, ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines
under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets, highlighting its scalability,

### [124] [CLUE: Non-parametric Verification from Experience via Hidden-State Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01591)
*Zhenwen Liang,Ruosen Li,Yujun Zhou,Linfeng Song,Dian Yu,Xinya Du,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLUE is a non-parametric verifier that uses hidden state trajectories to assess LLM output quality, outperforming text-based and confidence-based methods without trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for assessing LLM output quality either rely on text-level information (which can overfit) or calibrated token probabilities (which fail on less-calibrated models), but both are partial projections of the richer information in hidden states.

Method: CLUE uses hidden state trajectories as a unified foundation for verification. It summarizes reasoning traces by hidden state deltas and classifies correctness via nearest-centroid distance to "success" and "failure" clusters formed from past experience, with no trainable parameters.

Result: CLUE consistently outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches/exceeds confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving top-1 and majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. On AIME 24 with a 1.5B model, it boosts accuracy from 56.7% to 70.0%.

Conclusion: Hidden states encode correctness as geometrically separable signatures, providing a strong foundation for verification that enables simple yet effective methods like CLUE to significantly improve LLM output quality assessment.

Abstract: Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a
critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information
(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,
or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on
less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial
projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden
states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical
features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly
align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper
explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We
show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable
signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we
present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately
minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only
summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies
correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''
clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights
the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently
outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern
confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and
majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24
with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0%
(top-maj@16).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare the effectiveness and computational costs of different fine-tuning strategies for RAG pipelines, as both embedding and generator models can be fine-tuned to improve performance on new tasks.

Method: The study evaluates several RAG fine-tuning strategies: independent fine-tuning (separate tuning of embedding and generator models), joint fine-tuning (simultaneous tuning of both models), and two-phase fine-tuning (sequential tuning approach).

Result: All fine-tuning strategies achieved approximately equal improvement in Exact Match (EM) and F1 generation quality metrics, but they had significantly different computational costs.

Conclusion: The optimal fine-tuning strategy depends on whether the training dataset includes context labels and whether grid search over learning rates for both embedding and generator models is required.

framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models
(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database
that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the
retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and
generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on
a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and
benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning
strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our
experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal
improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have
significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal
fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes
context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the
embedding and generator models is required.

*Yu-Cheng Chih,Ming-Tao Duan,Yong-Hao Hou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PureTC-1B is a three-stage stabilization pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct that reduces Traditional Chinese token-level instability using CPT, SFT, and DPO with parameter-efficient LoRA adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Language Models in Traditional Chinese suffer from token-level instability, unpredictably emitting non-TC characters or code-switching into other languages, hindering deployment in cost-effective, on-device applications.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: Continual Pre-Training on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization using TC-adherence preferences with parameter-efficient LoRA adapters.

Result: 51.3% relative reduction in non-TC output tokens versus base model; 77.2% reduction in incorrect-language tokens relative to Llama-3B and 57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B on Named Entity Translation task.

Conclusion: Robust Traditional Chinese adherence is attainable at 1B scale with reproducible, adapter-only pipeline that enhances language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) enable cost-effective, on-device and
latency-sensitive AI applications, yet their deployment in Traditional Chinese
(TC) remains hindered by token-level instability - models unpredictably emit
non-TC characters or code-switch into other languages. We address this
practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization
pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model
released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines
Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model
retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B
achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens
versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B
further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and
57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable
even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and
hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance
language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

*Hui Yi Leong,Yuheng Li,Yuqing Wu,Wenwen Ouyang,Wei Zhu,Jiechao Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMAS is a dynamic multi-agent system framework that uses lightweight LLM adaptation to autonomously design optimal graph configurations for different tasks, outperforming traditional fixed-topology approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based multi-agent systems are limited by inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness, reducing their effectiveness across diverse workloads.

Method: Introduces a dynamic graph designer that autonomously identifies task-specific optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, directing queries through task-optimized agent pathways based on input properties.

Result: AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent approaches across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation benchmarks with diverse LLM architectures.

Conclusion: Context-sensitive structural adaptability is a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM multi-agent system deployments.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language
processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous
multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent
barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by
inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness,
resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial
workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a
paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel
dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific
optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the
reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS
exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct
query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation
across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation
benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art
single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our
investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability
constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS
deployments.

*John Hawkins,Aditya Pramar,Rodney Beard,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes machine learning models' ability to detect jailbreak prompts that circumvent LLM safety guardrails, finding that fine-tuned BERT models perform best at identifying both known and novel jailbreak strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak prompts that manipulate input text to bypass safety measures, creating a need for effective detection methods to maintain developer policies and prevent undesirable responses.

Method: The study evaluates various machine learning models for distinguishing jailbreak prompts from genuine uses, with particular focus on identifying previously unseen jailbreak strategies. The best approach involves fine-tuning a BERT model end-to-end specifically for jailbreak detection.

Result: Fine-tuned BERT models achieved the best performance in detecting jailbreak prompts using current datasets. The research also identified that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure serves as a distinguishing signal for jailbreak intention.

Conclusion: End-to-end fine-tuned BERT models are currently the most effective solution for detecting jailbreak prompts, and explicit reflexivity in prompt structure can be used as an indicator of malicious intent to circumvent LLM safety mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that
allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of
the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM
into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses
acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability
of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from
genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use
previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets
the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying
jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine
prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a
signal of jailbreak intention.

TL;DR: This paper explores overcoming unidirectional attention limitations in LLMs for text embedding tasks by enabling bidirectional attention through additional training steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive LLMs have limited performance in text embedding tasks due to unidirectional attention constraints, which this research aims to address.

Method: Tested different Llama architecture variants with additional training steps to enable bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

Result: The paper presents findings on whether bidirectional attention can overcome the limitations of unidirectional attention in LLMs for text embedding.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the potential of enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs to improve their performance in text embedding tasks and semantic representation analysis.

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional
performance in language understanding and generation. However, their
application in text embedding tasks has been relatively slow, along with the
analysis of their semantic representation in probing tasks, due to the
constraints of the unidirectional attention mechanism.
  This paper aims to explore whether such constraints can be overcome by
enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs. We tested different variants of the
Llama architecture through additional training steps, progressively enabling
bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLASP is a framework that defines agentic capabilities for closed-loop autonomous security systems, addressing gaps in evaluating and benchmarking such systems in cybersecurity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cybersecurity defenses are fragmented and unable to keep pace with AI-driven offensive systems, lacking proper frameworks to evaluate autonomous security agents that can perform integrated defense functions.

Method: Developed CLASP framework aligning security lifecycle (reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis, validation) with agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, reflection & perception), and introduced Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score to quantify loop closure and effectiveness.

Result: Applied CLASP to analyze 21 representative works, identifying strengths and capability gaps in existing systems, and established metrics for measuring closed-loop security agent performance.

Conclusion: CLASP and CLC Score provide the necessary vocabulary, diagnostics, and measurements to advance both functional performance and evaluation of closed-loop security agents in cybersecurity.

Abstract: Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems
evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling
remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots
that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit
confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer
promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic
capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled
method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their
performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous
Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle
(reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis,
validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory,
reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric
for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21
representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where
capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score,
a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational
effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark.
Together, CLASP and the CLC Score, provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and
measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure
closed loop security agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support the development of effective MDS models by providing robust automatic evaluation methods that reduce cost and human effort, requiring a strong meta-evaluation benchmark grounded in human annotations.

Method: Introduce MDSEval benchmark with image-sharing dialogues, summaries, and human judgments across eight quality aspects. Propose a novel filtering framework using Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across modalities to ensure data quality and richness.

Result: Benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced MLLMs and their susceptibility to various biases.

Conclusion: MDSEval is the first meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS that formalizes key evaluation dimensions specific to multimodal dialogue summarization and identifies limitations in current evaluation methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications. To support the development of effective MDS models, robust
automatic evaluation methods are essential for reducing both cost and human
effort. However, such methods require a strong meta-evaluation benchmark
grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues,
corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality
aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering
framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across
modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation
dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation
methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced
MLLMs and their susceptibility to various bias.

### [133] [FOR-Prompting: From Objection to Revision via an Asymmetric Prompting Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01674)
*He Zhang,Anzhou Zhang,Jian Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FOR-Prompting is a reasoning protocol that uses role-based questioning (Defender, Objectioner, Host) to elicit self-revision, achieving significant accuracy gains over single-prompt methods and comparable performance to Chain of Thought, especially benefiting small models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning protocols like Chain of Thought and Tree of Thought organize internal deliberation but lack explicit mechanisms for external questioning that drives self-revision and error correction.

Method: Asymmetric protocol with three roles: Defender proposes answers, Objectioner raises question-style objections without direct fixes, and Host enforces consistency and closure. Operates purely at prompt level through role-structured turns without requiring model retraining.

Result: 22% point gain over single-prompt on GSM8K, accuracy on par with CoT, 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from GPT-4.1 judge. Corrects mistakes without tools/human supervision, improves small model performance (19% accuracy gain for Llama3.2:1b).

Conclusion: FOR-Prompting is model-agnostic, supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning, and shows promise for small models and personal device use by enhancing exploration, refinement, and making assumptions explicit.

Abstract: Reasoning protocols such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT)
organize internal deliberation but lack an explicit mechanism for external
questioning that elicits self-revision. We present FOR-Prompting (From
Objection to Revision Prompting), an asymmetric protocol where a Defender
proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections with no
direct fixes, and a Host enforces consistency and closure. On GSM8K we observe
about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with
more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1
judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision
on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (approx. 19%
accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for
small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative
analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with
dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is
model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured
turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without
retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.

### [134] [How Do Language Models Compose Functions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01685)
*Apoorv Khandelwal,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs suffer from a compositionality gap where they can compute individual functions but struggle with their composition. The study identifies two processing mechanisms - compositional and direct - with the choice influenced by embedding space geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs use compositional mechanisms when solving compositional tasks, specifically examining the compositionality gap in two-hop factual recall tasks.

Method: Used logit lens on residual stream activations of feedforward LLMs to analyze how they process two-hop factual recall tasks expressed as g(f(x)).

Result: Identified two distinct processing mechanisms: compositional (computing intermediate f(x)) and direct (computing g(f(x)) without detectable intermediate). The dominant mechanism depends on embedding space geometry, with direct processing preferred when linear mapping exists from x to g(f(x)).

Conclusion: LLMs don't always use compositional reasoning even when capable of individual functions, and the processing mechanism choice is influenced by the geometric properties of the embedding space.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) appear to be increasingly capable of
solving compositional tasks, it is an open question whether they do so using
compositional mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs
solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as
$g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the
"compositionality gap": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y =
g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$.
Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two
processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\textit{compositionally}$,
computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves
them $\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate
variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to
be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being
dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in
the embedding spaces. We fully release our data and code at:

TL;DR: LLMs in medical pre-consultation suffer from Format Inertia - generating repetitive but uninformative questions in long dialogues due to skewed turn-count distributions in training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the novel failure mechanism called Format Inertia in LLMs for medical pre-consultation, where models generate format-correct but diagnostically uninformative questions in long dialogues.

Method: A simple, data-centric approach that rebalances the turn-count distribution of the training dataset to mitigate Format Inertia.

Result: Experimental results show the approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical pre-consultation tasks.

Conclusion: Rebalancing turn-count distribution in training data effectively mitigates Format Inertia, improving LLM performance in medical dialogue generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought significant
improvements to various service domains, including chatbots and medical
pre-consultation applications. In the healthcare domain, the most common
approach for adapting LLMs to multi-turn dialogue generation is Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, datasets for SFT in tasks like medical
pre-consultation typically exhibit a skewed turn-count distribution. Training
on such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**,
where models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically
uninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed
failure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the
turn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that
our approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical
pre-consultation.

*Jiwan Chung,Neel Joshi,Pratyusha Sharma,Youngjae Yu,Vibhav Vineet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MathLens is a benchmark that disentangles multimodal reasoning into perception, reasoning, and integration subskills for geometry problems, revealing that different training approaches have uneven effects on these components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of multimodal reasoning models focuses on aggregate accuracy, which obscures where and how models are actually improving across different subskills.

Method: The benchmark separates performance into three components (perception, reasoning, integration) and provides annotations including visual diagrams, textual descriptions, controlled questions, and perceptual probes derived from symbolic specifications.

Result: Reinforcement learning mainly strengthens perception, reasoning improves only with perception, integration remains the weakest capacity, and robustness diverges between training approaches.

Conclusion: The study reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects on multimodal reasoning subskills, with integration being the most challenging component and robustness showing divergent patterns across training methods.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging
domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated
by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are
improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the
subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of
textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into
three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs,
Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting
relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each
test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate
reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and
probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic
specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our
analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First,
reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when
supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves
perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in
tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with
residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally,
robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas
multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and
experimental logs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates how to transform engineering design standards into modular, machine-interpretable ontologies for automated quality assurance in plant design and equipment selection processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engineering design processes rely on document-centric specifications and standards despite digitalization ambitions, creating inefficiencies in compliance verification.

Method: Used modeling patterns to create modular ontologies from international piping, material and valve standards, aligned with ISO DIS 23726-3 Industrial Data Ontology (IDO). Tested on valve selection by instantiating valves and environmental conditions as semantic models.

Result: Enabled automated validation of valve data sheet compliance with standards and determination of product type suitability using semantic reasoning and executable design rules.

Conclusion: IDO-based modular ontologies enable semantic reasoning for equipment selection and demonstrate the potential for Standards Bodies to transition to digitized Smart Standards.

Abstract: Engineering design processes use technical specifications and must comply
with standards. Product specifications, product type data sheets, and design
standards are still mainly document-centric despite the ambition to digitalize
industrial work. In this paper, we demonstrate how to transform information
held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable,
machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of
the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to
create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently
referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve
design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format,
and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS
23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).
  We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping
standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are
instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic
representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset.
We create "functional location tags" as OWL individuals that become instances
of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create
instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated
validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards.
Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether
the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable
IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to
be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of
this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart
Standards.

*Wenbo Pan,Jie Xu,Qiguang Chen,Junhao Dong,Libo Qin,Xinfeng Li,Haining Yu,Xiaohua Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Refusal Index (RI), a new metric that measures how accurately LLMs refuse questions beyond their knowledge, addressing limitations of existing refusal and calibration metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics fail to faithfully measure LLMs' knowledge-aware refusal capability. Simple refusal metrics are biased by refusal rates, while calibration metrics are proxy-based and don't capture actual refusal behavior.

Method: Propose Refusal Index (RI) defined as Spearman's rank correlation between refusal probability and error probability. Design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method to efficiently estimate RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.

Result: Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets show RI accurately quantifies intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability. RI remains stable across different refusal rates and provides consistent model rankings independent of overall accuracy and refusal rates.

Conclusion: LLMs achieve high accuracy on factual tasks but their refusal behavior can be unreliable and fragile. RI should complement traditional accuracy metrics for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their
knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial
for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure
this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by
refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different
refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are
proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes
rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the
Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs
refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation
between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically
measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently
estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.
Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI
accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in
factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and
provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy
and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but
previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high
accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and
fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy
metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics for assessing text extraction quality from Russian judicial decisions, finding that Term Frequency Coherence and Coverage Ratio perform best in aligning with expert ratings, while LLM-based evaluation shows moderate alignment but limited legal specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of AI in legal NLP demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from judicial decisions without requiring pre-annotated ground truth.

Method: Evaluated 16 unsupervised metrics across document-based, semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories on 1,000 Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168 expert reviews using bootstrapped correlations, Lin's CCC, and MAE.

Result: Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson r=0.540, Lin CCC=0.512, MAE=0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson r=0.513, Lin CCC=0.443, MAE=0.139) best aligned with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density showed strong negative correlations. LLM Evaluation Score showed moderate alignment (Pearson r=0.382, Lin CCC=0.325, MAE=0.197).

Conclusion: Unsupervised metrics enable scalable screening but cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts due to moderate correlations and low CCC values. This work advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language

0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =
0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density
(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

TL;DR: FraudSquad is a hybrid detection model that combines text embeddings with graph transformers to detect LLM-generated spam reviews, achieving significant performance improvements over existing methods while being resource-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of LLMs enables generation of highly persuasive spam reviews that mimic human writing, posing serious threats to online platform credibility and challenging existing detection systems.

Method: Created three LLM-generated spam review datasets using different LLMs guided by product metadata and genuine reviews. Proposed FraudSquad - a hybrid model integrating text embeddings from pre-trained language models with gated graph transformers for spam node classification.

Result: FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on human-written spam datasets. It maintains modest model size and requires minimal labeled training data.

Conclusion: The work provides new synthetic datasets, a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. FraudSquad offers a practical solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly
persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose
significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the
credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic
LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by
product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm
the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this
threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text
embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for
spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral
signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training
resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three
LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two
human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model
size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution
for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets,
a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the
urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are

### [141] [Syntactic Blind Spots: How Misalignment Leads to LLMs Mathematical Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01831)
*Dane Williamson,Yangfeng Ji,Matthew Dwyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs fail on mathematically simple problems when phrased in unfamiliar syntax, due to "syntactic blind spots" rather than lack of mathematical competence. Rephrasing problems using simpler syntactic structures often leads to correct answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs fail on mathematically straightforward problems that are syntactically different from their training data, and to identify systematic failure modes related to syntax rather than mathematical ability.

Method: Rephrased incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates from correct examples, preserving semantics while reducing structural complexity. Quantified syntactic complexity using Dependency Locality Theory (DLT) scores.

Result: Higher DLT scores (more complex syntax) correlate with increased failure rates. Rephrasing problems with simpler syntax often leads to correct answers, showing errors stem from structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty.

Conclusion: Many LLM reasoning errors result from syntactic complexity and structural misalignment, not mathematical incompetence. Syntax-aware interventions can help identify and mitigate these inductive failures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving
abilities but frequently fail on problems that deviate syntactically from their
training distribution. We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind
spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that
are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors
are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle
coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we
rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from
correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing
structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic
complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show
that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across
multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from
structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that
syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCRIBES is a reinforcement learning framework that generates reusable extraction scripts for semi-structured web content by leveraging layout similarity across webpages, enabling scalable and efficient information extraction without per-page LLM inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semi-structured web content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes contains substantial factual data but is difficult to extract reliably. Existing methods either lack generalization or are resource-intensive due to requiring per-page LLM inference.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with layout similarity across webpages within the same site as reward signal. Generates reusable extraction scripts for structurally similar webpage groups. Iteratively trains on synthetic annotations from CommonCrawl data.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines by over 13% in script quality. Boosts downstream question answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o. Enables scalable and resource-efficient web information extraction.

Conclusion: SCRIBES provides an effective framework for extracting semi-structured web content at scale, overcoming limitations of existing methods through reusable scripts and layout-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Semi-structured content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes accounts for a
substantial share of factual data on the web, yet the formatting complicates
usage, and reliably extracting structured information from them remains
challenging. Existing methods either lack generalization or are
resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce
SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across
webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each
page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be
applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further
improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild
CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong
baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question
answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and
resource-efficient web information extraction.

### [143] [Model Merging to Maintain Language-Only Performance in Developmentally Plausible Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01845)
*Ece Takmaz,Lisa Bylinina,Jakub Dotlacil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the discrepancy between large vision-language models and child language acquisition by developing multimodal models in low-resource settings using developmentally plausible datasets. It explores model merging to maintain language-only abilities in multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art vision-language models use much more data than children are exposed to during language acquisition. The paper aims to develop more developmentally plausible models that work in low-resource settings while addressing the issue of multimodal models underperforming in language-only tasks.

Method: Developed language-only and multimodal models using developmentally plausible datasets in low-resource settings. Used model merging via weighted linear interpolation to fuse parameters of multimodal models with language-only models to maintain language abilities.

Result: Multimodal models outperformed previous BabyLM baselines. Confirmed that multimodal models underperform in language-only grammar benchmarks. Model merging with text-only models helped alleviate this problem to some extent while maintaining multimodal performance.

Conclusion: Model merging with text-only models can partially address the language-only performance degradation in multimodal models while preserving their multimodal capabilities, providing a promising approach for developing more developmentally plausible vision-language models.

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and
learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that
children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our
approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this
discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource
settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models
outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language
model literature is that these models tend to underperform in
\textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only
abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model
merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of
language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results
corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only
benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can
help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REPAIR is a lifelong editing framework for LLMs that enables precise, low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge through closed-loop feedback and dynamic memory management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high cost and unintended side effects of traditional post-training methods for LLMs, which struggle with knowledge acquisition, error correction, and maintaining stability during sequential edits.

Method: Uses a closed-loop feedback mechanism with dynamic memory management, frequent knowledge fusion, and strong locality guards to mitigate instability and conflicts in large-scale sequential edits.

Result: Boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30% across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: REPAIR provides a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and continually evolving LLMs that effectively addresses the limitations of distribution-agnostic editing methods.

Abstract: Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high
cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side
effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we
introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and
Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and
low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates
the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a
closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management.
Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong
locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional
distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects.
Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30%
across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting.
This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and
continually evolving LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper provides a systematic introduction and comprehensive survey of reward models (RMs) for enhancing LLM reasoning, covering their architectures, training methods, applications in inference and training, and addressing key open questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models play a critical role in improving LLM reasoning performance by providing training signals for reinforcement learning and helping select optimal answers during inference, but there's a need for systematic understanding and guidance on their effective deployment.

Method: The paper reviews fundamental concepts of RMs including architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques, then explores their applications in guiding generation, data synthesis, and RL-based fine-tuning.

Result: The analysis provides actionable insights for effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM reasoning, addressing critical questions about selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement based on existing research and empirical findings.

Conclusion: This comprehensive survey offers systematic guidance on reward models for LLM reasoning, covering both theoretical foundations and practical applications to advance the field.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in enhancing the reasoning
performance of LLMs. For example, they can provide training signals to finetune
LLMs during reinforcement learning (RL) and help select the best answer from
multiple candidates during inference. In this paper, we provide a systematic
introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in
LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their
architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we
explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal
outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative
self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based
finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the
selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on
existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide
actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM
reasoning.

TL;DR: Proposes Inverse Language Modeling (ILM) as a unified framework to improve LLM robustness against input perturbations and enable native grounding by inverting model outputs to identify unsafe triggers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current defensive mechanisms for LLMs are fragmented and underdeveloped compared to prior work on classifiers, creating a need for more comprehensive adversarial robustness solutions.

Method: Inverse Language Modeling (ILM) framework that transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable systems by inverting model outputs to identify toxic input triggers while improving robustness to perturbations.

Result: ILM enables simultaneous improvement of LLM robustness and native grounding capabilities, potentially helping red teaming efforts.

Conclusion: ILM can serve as foundation for next-generation LLMs that are more robust, grounded, controllable, and trustworthy.

Abstract: The current landscape of defensive mechanisms for LLMs is fragmented and
underdeveloped, unlike prior work on classifiers. To further promote
adversarial robustness in LLMs, we propose Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a
unified framework that simultaneously 1) improves the robustness of LLMs to
input perturbations, and, at the same time, 2) enables native grounding by
inverting model outputs to identify potentially toxic or unsafe input triggers.
ILM transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable and robust systems,
potentially helping RED teaming. ILM can lay the foundation for next-generation
LLMs that are not only robust and grounded but also fundamentally more
controllable and trustworthy. The code is publicly available at

*Qi He,Cheng Qian,Xiusi Chen,Bingxiang He,Yi R.,Fung,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Veri-R1 is an online reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs for claim verification by interacting with search engines and receiving reward signals to improve planning, retrieval, and reasoning behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing claim verification approaches rely on prompt engineering or predefined workflows without unified training paradigms, failing to develop comprehensive verification skills through dynamic interaction with retrieval systems.

Method: Online reinforcement learning framework where LLMs interact with search engines and receive reward signals that explicitly shape planning, retrieval, and reasoning behaviors during claim verification.

Result: Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often surpassing larger-scale models. Ablation studies show impact of reward components and link between output logits and label accuracy.

Conclusion: Online RL is effective for precise and faithful claim verification, providing a foundation for future research in LLM-empowered verification systems.

Abstract: Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted
considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and
transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only
judgments. Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and
reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or
predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to
improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a
search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning,
retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and
retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios
and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that
Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often
surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the
impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label
accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and
faithful claim verification and provide a foundation for future research. We
release our code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim
verification.

### [148] [Taking a SEAT: Predicting Value Interpretations from Sentiment, Emotion, Argument, and Topic Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01976)
*Adina Nicola Dobrinoiu,Ana Cristiana Marcu,Amir Homayounirad,Luciano Cavalcante Siebert,Enrico Liscio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models can better predict individual value interpretations by using multi-dimensional subjective annotations (SEAT dimensions: Sentiment, Emotion, Argument, Topics) as a proxy for personal interpretive lenses, outperforming single dimensions and no-information baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Value interpretations are subjective and shaped by sociocultural backgrounds. Recognizing individual value perspectives is crucial for developing AI systems that can align with diverse human viewpoints and avoid majority bias.

Method: Evaluated whether language models can predict individual value interpretations using SEAT dimensions (Sentiment, Emotion, Argument, Topics) as proxy for interpretive lenses. Tested across zero- and few-shot settings, comparing individual dimensions, combined dimensions, and no-information baselines.

Result: Providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yielded superior performance compared to individual dimensions and baseline. Individual variations across annotators highlighted the importance of accounting for subjective annotation behavior.

Conclusion: This controlled study provides the first evidence that annotation behavior (beyond demographics) impacts value prediction, establishing a foundation for future large-scale validation of personalized AI alignment with diverse human values.

Abstract: Our interpretation of value concepts is shaped by our sociocultural
background and lived experiences, and is thus subjective. Recognizing
individual value interpretations is important for developing AI systems that
can align with diverse human perspectives and avoid bias toward majority
viewpoints. To this end, we investigate whether a language model can predict
individual value interpretations by leveraging multi-dimensional subjective
annotations as a proxy for their interpretive lens. That is, we evaluate
whether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion,
Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting
their value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot
settings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields
superior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no
information about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual
variations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the
incorporation of individual subjective annotators. To the best of our
knowledge, this controlled setting, although small in size, is the first
attempt to go beyond demographics and investigate the impact of annotation
behavior on value prediction, providing a solid foundation for future
large-scale validation.

*Ryosuke Kohita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Schema normalization significantly impacts NL2SQL performance - denormalized schemas work better for simple queries while normalized schemas excel at aggregation queries, with few-shot examples helping mitigate normalization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study how schema normalization affects NL2SQL system performance, as most prior research evaluates models on fixed schemas without considering design impact.

Method: Evaluated eight leading LLMs on synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper datasets with varied normalization levels, using both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Result: Denormalized schemas achieved high accuracy on simple retrieval queries even with cost-effective models in zero-shot. Normalized schemas (2NF/3NF) caused base table selection and join prediction errors but were substantially improved by few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas performed better due to robustness against data duplication and NULL values.

Conclusion: Optimal schema design for NL2SQL depends on query types - schema design should be considered when developing NL2SQL interfaces and adaptive schema selection should be integrated for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Schema design, particularly normalization, is a critical yet often overlooked
factor in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems. Most prior research
evaluates models on fixed schemas, overlooking the influence of design on
performance. We present the first systematic study of schema normalization's
impact, evaluating eight leading large language models on synthetic and
real-world datasets with varied normalization levels. We construct controlled
synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper
datasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas
offer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective
models in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF)
introduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type
prediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing
few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas yielded better
performance, mainly due to their robustness against the data duplication and
NULL value issues that cause errors in denormalized schemas. These findings
suggest that the optimal schema design for NL2SQL applications depends on the
types of queries to be supported. Our study demonstrates the importance of
considering schema design when developing NL2SQL interfaces and integrating
adaptive schema selection for real-world scenarios.

*Md Arid Hasan,Firoj Alam,Md Fahad Hossain,Usman Naseem,Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BanglaMultiHate, the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset, and compares various models including LLMs, showing that culturally grounded pretraining remains crucial for robust performance in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online platforms need reliable hate speech detection, especially for low-resource languages like Bangla where existing tools are limited and most prior work focuses on single-task detection with poor coverage of multi-facet signals.

Method: Created BanglaMultiHate dataset with manual annotations, then conducted comprehensive comparison of classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs using zero-shot prompting and LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: LoRA-tuned LLMs are competitive with BanglaBERT, but culturally and linguistically grounded pretraining remains critical for robust performance in low-resource Bangla hate speech detection.

Conclusion: The dataset and findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned moderation tools in low-resource contexts, with culturally grounded pretraining being essential despite LLM advancements.

Abstract: Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and
information seeking. While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also
provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and
bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such
content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection
systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where
moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources
and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited
coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps
by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset,
BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building
on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning
classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot
prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a
low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs
are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded
pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and
findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned
moderation tools in low-resource contexts. For reproducibility, we will release
the dataset and all related scripts.

*Donghoon Jung,Jiwoo Choi,Songeun Chae,Seohyon Jung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes LLM creativity through a process-oriented lens using constraint-based decision-making and authorial personas, finding that models consistently prioritize Style over other narrative elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of LLM creativity focus mainly on output quality rather than the creative processes themselves, leaving a gap in understanding how LLMs make creative decisions.

Method: The study uses controlled prompting to assign authorial personas to LLMs and analyzes their creative preferences through constraint-based decision-making, drawing on narratology concepts.

Result: LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other narrative elements like Character, Event, and Setting, and distinctive creative profiles emerge across different models when examining their reasoning.

Conclusion: The approach provides a novel systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity, revealing distinctive creative preferences and decision-making patterns in language models.

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs)' creativity have focused
primarily on the quality of their outputs rather than the processes that shape
them. This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to
examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based
decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting
to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the
models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other
elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the
reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive
profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel
systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Streaming RAG enables speech-in speech-out dialogue systems to use tools like web search with reduced latency by predicting tool queries during user speech and generating spoken summaries that combine audio queries with retrieved text results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end speech dialogue systems generate natural responses but suffer from hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While text systems use tools like web search, speech systems lack this capability and tool integration increases latency, disrupting conversation flow.

Method: Proposed Streaming Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Streaming RAG) that predicts tool queries in parallel with user speech before they finish speaking. Developed post-training pipeline to teach model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and generate spoken summaries fusing audio queries with retrieved text.

Result: On AudioCRAG benchmark, streaming RAG increased QA accuracy by 200% relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and reduced tool use latency by 20%. The approach is modality-agnostic and works for both speech and typed input.

Conclusion: Streaming RAG enables more agentic, real-time AI assistants by allowing speech-in speech-out systems to use tools with reduced latency, improving both accuracy and user experience.

Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful
alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural,
expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems
remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While
text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as
web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend
tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that
tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting
conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived
latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before
the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline
that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how
to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text
results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our
approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries
from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results
demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200%
relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by
reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is
modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for
more agentic, real-time AI assistants.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCoT is a Streaming Chain-of-Thought framework for Duplex spoken dialogue systems that processes user input in blocks and generates responses continuously, eliminating the need for voice activity detection while improving coherence and reducing latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VAD-based systems fail to distinguish between pauses and turn completions, while existing duplex SDS models have complex architectures and lag in semantic reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes a Streaming Chain-of-Thought framework that alternates between processing fixed-duration user input blocks and generating responses in a blockwise manner, using frame-level alignments to create intermediate targets for user transcripts and system responses.

Result: The approach produces more coherent and interpretable responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

Conclusion: SCoT effectively addresses the limitations of both VAD-based and existing duplex SDS models by providing continuous processing with improved semantic reasoning and reduced latency.

Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity
detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses
and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output
continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit
VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind
cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose
SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating
between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a
blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate
targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block.
Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable

### [154] [The Disparate Impacts of Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02128)
*Jameson Sandler,Ahmet Üstün,Marco Romanelli,Sara Hooker,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speculative decoding shows unequal speed-up rates across tasks, with under-fit and underrepresented tasks benefiting less. The paper analyzes this unfairness, identifies contributing factors, and proposes a mitigation strategy that improves fairness by 12% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and address the disparate speed-up rates in speculative decoding, where under-fit and underrepresented tasks experience diminished benefits compared to well-fit tasks.

Method: Derived an analysis to quantify the unfairness in speculative decoding speed-ups, identified factors causing disparate performance, and proposed a mitigation strategy to reduce speed-up disparities.

Result: The mitigation strategy was validated across several model pairs, showing on average a 12% improvement in the fairness metric, reducing the speed-up disparities between different tasks.

Conclusion: Speculative decoding introduces systematic unfairness in speed-up rates across tasks, but this can be mitigated through targeted strategies that improve fairness while maintaining overall efficiency gains.

Abstract: The practice of speculative decoding, whereby inference is probabilistically
supported by a smaller, cheaper, ``drafter'' model, has become a standard
technique for systematically reducing the decoding time of large language
models. This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the
lens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the
paper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly
distributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often
underrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an
analysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the
factors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by
these insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce
speed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs,
revealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RESTRAIN is a self-penalizing RL framework that enables models to improve reasoning without gold labels by penalizing overconfident predictions and low-consistency examples while preserving promising reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning with human-annotated data is costly and struggles with harder tasks, creating a need for experience-driven learning that can improve without curated labels.

Method: A self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of gold labels into a learning signal by penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency examples, while integrating with policy optimization methods like GRPO.

Result: Achieved substantial improvements: up to +140.7% Pass@1 on AIME25, +36.2% on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6% on GPQA-Diamond using only unlabeled data, nearly matching gold-label training performance.

Conclusion: RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward stronger reasoning without requiring gold labels, demonstrating effective self-improvement in challenging reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought
reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in
labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is
experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by
adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with
Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of
gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to
spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire
answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency
examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization
mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO,
enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging
reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data.
With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to
+140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on
GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.
These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward
stronger reasoning without gold labels.

*Hsuan Su,Ting-Yao Hu,Hema Swetha Koppula,Kundan Krishna,Hadi Pouransari,Cheng-Yu Hsieh,Cem Koc,Joseph Yitan Cheng,Oncel Tuzel,Raviteja Vemulapalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RL4HS is a reinforcement learning framework that uses span-level rewards and explicit reasoning to detect hallucination spans in LLM outputs, outperforming pretrained models and supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate hallucinations that undermine reliability, and while most prior work treats hallucination detection as binary, real applications require identifying specific hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision process.

Method: Proposes RL4HS - a reinforcement learning framework using span-level reward functions, building on Group Relative Policy Optimization and introducing Class-Aware Policy Optimization to address reward imbalance.

Result: Experiments on RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, QA, data-to-text) show RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models and supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning with span-level rewards is necessary for effectively detecting hallucination spans in LLM outputs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported
content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination
detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying
hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This
naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the
complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we
first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least
one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose
RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a
span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization
and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance
issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question
answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models
and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement
learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SPINACH, an LLM-based agent that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries through an iterative exploration and execution process, addressing the high barrier of SPARQL for non-technical users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPARQL has a high barrier for non-computer science users, and LLMs can help lower this barrier through Text2SPARQL translation. The work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL challenge to improve this domain.

Method: SPINACH uses an LLM-backed agent that translates natural language to SPARQL queries not in a single shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution.

Result: The paper describes the overall architecture and design decisions, and conducts a thorough analysis of agent behavior to identify areas for future improvements.

Conclusion: The iterative approach of SPINACH provides insights for targeted improvements in Text2SPARQL translation, making knowledge graph interaction more accessible to non-technical users.

Abstract: Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a
background in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL)
has a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that
barrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this
paper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent
that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single
shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the
overall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also
conduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future
areas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL
challenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the

### [159] [Say One Thing, Do Another? Diagnosing Reasoning-Execution Gaps in VLM-Powered Mobile-Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02204)
*Lingzhong Dong,Ziqi Zhou,Shuaibo Yang,Haiyue Sheng,Pengzhou Cheng,Zongru Wu,Zheng Wu,Gongshen Liu,Zhuosheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new evaluation framework to diagnose reasoning-execution gaps in mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models, focusing on whether chain-of-thought reasoning aligns with ground-truth actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations emphasize execution accuracy but neglect whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth actions, which can lead to over-trust and potential harmful actions when users rely on seemingly plausible but misaligned reasoning.

Method: Introduces Ground-Truth Alignment (GTA) metric to measure whether the action implied by CoT matches ground-truth action, combined with Exact Match (EM) metric to jointly assess reasoning and execution accuracy.

Result: Experimental results show reasoning-execution gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than reasoning gaps. Scaling up model size reduces overall gaps but sizable execution gaps persist even in largest models.

Conclusion: The framework reliably reflects systematic reasoning-execution gap patterns and offers concrete diagnostics to support development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

Abstract: Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great
potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating
corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies
suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve
the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution
accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth
actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,
which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may
unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss
or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to
diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment
(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the
ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)
metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.
This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)
Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action
but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but
reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results
across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution
gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than
reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,
sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis
shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in
state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support
the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMPO is a novel RL framework that adaptively uses multiple teacher models to guide LLMs in long chain-of-thought reasoning, improving reasoning diversity and performance through selective guidance and comprehension-based learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods rely on self-exploration or single teachers, which can introduce model biases and limit exploration, restricting reasoning diversity and performance.

Method: AMPO adaptively leverages guidance from multiple proficient teacher models only when the on-policy model fails, with a comprehension-based selection mechanism that prompts students to learn from reasoning paths they're most likely to understand.

Result: AMPO outperforms GRPO baseline by 4.3% on mathematical reasoning and 12.2% on out-of-distribution tasks, significantly boosts Pass@k performance, enables more diverse exploration, and achieves comparable results to approaches using single more powerful teachers with less data.

Conclusion: AMPO demonstrates a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability in LLMs through adaptive multi-teacher guidance and comprehension-based learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy
teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may
introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting
reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher
strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance
Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages
guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy
model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach
expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover,
AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the
student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend,
thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive
experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with
a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on
out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and
enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our
method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more
powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate
a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the scarcity of Arabic-language cyberbullying detection methods by developing deep learning models that achieve up to 98% accuracy using Bi-LSTM with FastText embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of social media platforms like X (Twitter) endangers young people's emotional well-being through cyberbullying, while most existing detection methods focus on English, leaving Arabic-language detection underdeveloped.

Method: Assembled a dataset of 10,662 X posts, pre-processed data, used kappa tool for annotation quality, and tested multiple deep learning models including LSTM, Bi-LSTM with various word embeddings, and BERT-based approaches.

Result: LSTM-BERT and Bi-LSTM-BERT achieved 97% accuracy, while Bi-LSTM with FastText embedding performed even better with 98% accuracy. The results demonstrate generalizability.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning models effectively detect Arabic-language cyberbullying with high accuracy, addressing the gap in non-English cyberbullying detection methods.

Abstract: Recent technological advances in smartphones and communications, including
the growth of such online platforms as massive social media networks such as X
(formerly known as Twitter) endangers young people and their emotional
well-being by exposing them to cyberbullying, taunting, and bullying content.
Most proposed approaches for automatically detecting cyberbullying have been
developed around the English language, and methods for detecting
Arabic-language cyberbullying are scarce. Methods for detecting Arabic-language
cyberbullying are especially scarce. This paper aims to enhance the
effectiveness of methods for detecting cyberbullying in Arabic-language
content. We assembled a dataset of 10,662 X posts, pre-processed the data, and
used the kappa tool to verify and enhance the quality of our annotations. We
conducted four experiments to test numerous deep learning models for
automatically detecting Arabic-language cyberbullying. We first tested a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model and a bidirectional long short-term memory
(Bi-LSTM) model with several experimental word embeddings. We also tested the
LSTM and Bi-LSTM models with a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder from
representations (BERT) and then tested them on a different experimental models
BERT again. LSTM-BERT and Bi-LSTM-BERT demonstrated a 97% accuracy. Bi-LSTM
with FastText embedding word performed even better, achieving 98% accuracy. As
a result, the outcomes are generalize

TL;DR: The paper introduces TECA metric and CER mechanism to address LLM overthinking by enabling dynamic termination of reasoning processes, reducing response length by up to 71% on simpler datasets while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate unnecessarily lengthy reasoning steps for simpler problems (overthinking), which degrades efficiency and makes it difficult to adapt reasoning depth to problem complexity.

Method: Proposes Token Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA) metric to measure exploration extent, and Cumulative Entropy Regulation (CER) mechanism implementing 'Explore Briefly, Then Decide' paradigm for dynamic reasoning termination.

Result: Experimental results show substantial mitigation of overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving ability, with average response length decreasing by up to 71% on simpler datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach creates a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process for LLMs by dynamically determining optimal stopping points for reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they
often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy
reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of
the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the
complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token
Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration
throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm
-- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy
Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model
dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and
provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental
results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach
substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving
ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by
up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfoMosaic-Bench is a benchmark for evaluating LLM agents' ability to combine general web search with domain-specific tools for complex information seeking tasks across six domains, revealing current limitations in tool usage and integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents rely heavily on noisy and unreliable open-web search, while many real-world tasks require precise domain-specific knowledge unavailable from the web. The emergence of Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables tool integration, but it's unclear whether agents can effectively leverage these tools and combine them with general search.

Method: Created InfoMosaic-Bench benchmark covering six domains (medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration) with tasks requiring combination of general-purpose search and domain-specific tools. Used InfoMosaic-Flow pipeline to synthesize tasks grounded in verified tool outputs with cross-source dependencies, filtering out trivial lookup cases.

Result: Experiments with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents showed: web information alone is insufficient (GPT-5 achieved only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass rate); domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits; and 22.4% of failures came from incorrect tool usage or selection.

Conclusion: Current LLM agents still struggle with basic tool handling and effectively integrating domain-specific tools with general web search, highlighting significant limitations in multi-source information seeking capabilities.

Abstract: Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However,
existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two
fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many
real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from
the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to
interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this
limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such
tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with
general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce
InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information
seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains
(medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration),
InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with
domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable
pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces
cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial
lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments
with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information
alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass
rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving
some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from
incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still
struggle with even basic tool handling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates cross-lingual transfer of reasoning capabilities in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) after English Reinforcement Post-Training, finding significant variations in transferability and proposing parallel training to improve multilingual generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether reasoning capabilities achieved from English Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) effectively transfer to other languages, challenging the assumption that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition.

Method: Systematic evaluation of English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks, introducing a cross-lingual transferability metric, and conducting interventional studies and parallel training experiments.

Result: Cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across models, languages, and training paradigms. Models with stronger initial English capabilities show diminished cross-lingual generalization due to over-reliance on English-specific patterns.

Conclusion: The study reveals three key findings: First-Parallel Leap (performance jump with single parallel language), Parallel Scaling Law (power-law relationship with parallel languages), and Monolingual Generalization Gap (failure of English-centric LRMs to fully generalize across languages), challenging assumptions about LRM reasoning mirroring human cognition.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased
interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has
primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or
modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to
investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:
$\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively
transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating
English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a
metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that
cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target
language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that
models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on
English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.
To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental
results yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial
leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single
parallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing
that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of
training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between
actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as
$\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs
fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption
that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the
development of more language-agnostic LRMs.

*Raphael Tang,Crystina Zhang,Wenyan Li,Carmen Lai,Pontus Stenetorp,Yao Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current LLM arena evaluation treats draws as equal performance, but this paper shows draws actually indicate query difficulty rather than model equality. Ignoring draws in rating updates improves prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the prevailing paradigm that treats draws in LLM arena evaluation as indicating equal model performance, and instead investigate whether draws are more indicative of query difficulty.

Method: Analyzed three real-world arena datasets using four different rating systems, comparing battle outcome prediction accuracy when ignoring vs. including draws in rating updates.

Result: Ignoring rating updates for draws yielded 1-3% relative increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy across all rating systems. Draws occurred more frequently for very easy queries (risk ratio 1.37) and highly objective queries (risk ratio 1.35).

Conclusion: Draws in LLM arena evaluation are more indicative of query difficulty than equal model performance. Future rating systems should reconsider draw semantics and account for query properties in rating updates.

Abstract: In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond
to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the
"battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The
prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as
two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its
derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,
we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and
hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that
draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then
both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena
datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative
increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all
four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for
queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of
1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider
existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.

*Jianzhang Zhang,Jialong Zhou,Chuang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OR-Toolformer fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with semi-automatic data synthesis and external solver augmentation to address privacy concerns and high compute costs in OR tasks, achieving up to 80.1% execution accuracy and strong zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns from relying on closed-source APIs for OR tasks and reduce high compute costs of training open-source models from scratch.

Method: Fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct using semi-automatic data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse OR problem-answer pairs and augments the model with external solvers to produce API calls.

Result: Achieves up to 80.1% execution accuracy on three of four standard benchmarks (exceeding size-matched baselines by over 4.3%), and 54% average accuracy in zero-shot evaluation on unseen OR problem types (21 percentage-point improvement over strongest baseline).

Conclusion: Tool-augmented fine-tuning LLMs are effective for accurate and generalizable OR problem modeling and solving.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning, but
reliance on closed-source APIs for OR tasks raises privacy concerns, and
training open-source models from scratch incurs high compute costs. We
introduce OR-Toolformer, which fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with a
semi-automatic data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse OR problem-answer
pairs and augments the model with external solvers to produce API calls. On
three of four standard benchmarks, OR-Toolformer achieves up to 80.1% execution
accuracy, exceeding size-matched baselines by over 4.3%. In zero-shot
evaluation on two unseen OR problem types, it attains 54% average accuracy, a
21 percentage-point improvement over the strongest baseline. These findings
validate the efficacy of tool-augmented fine-tuning LLMs for accurate and
generalizable OR problem modeling and solving.

*Kunal Jha,Aydan Yuenan Huang,Eric Ye,Natasha Jaques,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ROTE is a novel algorithm that models human behavior as behavioral programs synthesized by LLMs and uses probabilistic inference to predict actions, outperforming baselines by up to 50% in accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for human behavior prediction are data-hungry and brittle due to unrealistic rationality assumptions or computational demands. Many everyday social interactions follow predictable patterns that minimize cognitive load.

Method: ROTE uses large language models to synthesize a hypothesis space of behavioral programs (routines modeled as computer code) and probabilistic inference to reason about uncertainty over that space.

Result: ROTE outperforms competitive baselines including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods by up to 50% in in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization in gridworld tasks and embodied household simulator.

Conclusion: By treating action understanding as program synthesis, ROTE enables AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe
human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are
often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions
about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our
key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable
patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and
observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these
routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than
policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel
algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a
hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for
reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of
gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts
human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive
baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as
50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By
treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path
for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the
real-world.

*Zekun Jiang,Chunming Xu,Tianhang Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CA-ChemE system enables autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering through multi-agent collaboration, addressing interdisciplinary limitations and knowledge gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI systems in chemical engineering lack effective interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted problems, limiting their potential for autonomous scientific discovery.

Method: Developed CA-ChemE system with domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents featuring ontology engineering capabilities for multi-agent collaboration.

Result: Knowledge base enhancement improved dialogue quality by 10-15%, while collaboration agent intervention achieved 8.5% improvement for distant-domain pairs vs 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs, revealing the "knowledge-base gaps" effect.

Conclusion: Carefully designed multi-agent architectures provide a viable pathway toward autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering by addressing interdisciplinary collaboration bottlenecks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated
substantial potential in chemical engineering, yet existing AI systems remain
limited in interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted
problems. To address these issues, we present the Cyber Academia-Chemical
Engineering (CA-ChemE) system, a living digital town that enables self-directed
research evolution and emergent scientific discovery through multi-agent
collaboration. By integrating domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge
enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents, the system successfully
constructs an intelligent ecosystem capable of deep professional reasoning and
efficient interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that
knowledge base-enabled enhancement mechanisms improved dialogue quality scores
by 10-15% on average across all seven expert agents, fundamentally ensuring
technical judgments are grounded in verifiable scientific evidence. However, we
observed a critical bottleneck in cross-domain collaboration efficiency,
prompting the introduction of a Collaboration Agent (CA) equipped with ontology
engineering capabilities. CA's intervention achieved 8.5% improvements for
distant-domain expert pairs compared to only 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs -
a 10.6-fold difference - unveiling the "diminished collaborative efficiency
caused by knowledge-base gaps" effect. This study demonstrates how carefully
designed multi-agent architectures can provide a viable pathway toward
autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering.

### [171] [The Social Laboratory: A Psychometric Framework for Multi-Agent LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01295)
*Zarreen Reza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new evaluation framework using multi-agent debate as a social laboratory to measure emergent social and cognitive behaviors in LLM-based agents, revealing strong consensus-seeking tendencies and persona-driven psychometric profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluation benchmarks are insufficient for autonomous LLM agents as they fail to capture emergent social and cognitive dynamics in interactive environments where agents communicate, persuade, and collaborate.

Method: Multi-agent debate framework with LLM-based agents assigned distinct personas and incentives, deliberating on challenging topics under LLM moderator supervision, analyzed using psychometric and semantic metrics.

Result: Agents consistently seek consensus with high semantic agreement (μ > 0.88) without explicit instruction, personas induce stable psychometric profiles, and moderator personas significantly alter debate outcomes through environmental structuring.

Conclusion: Provides a blueprint for dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols for agentic AI, offering crucial methodology for understanding and shaping social behaviors of next-generation AI agents.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous
agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on
downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the
emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,
persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a
controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our
framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and
incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the
supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of
psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across
hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for
agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu}
> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show
that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,
particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can
significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key
finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new
class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for
the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and
shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have
released the code and results at

### [172] [Agentic Jigsaw Interaction Learning for Enhancing Visual Perception and Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01304)
*Yu Zeng,Wenxuan Huang,Shiting Huang,Xikun Bao,Yukun Qi,Yiming Zhao,Qiuchen Wang,Lin Chen,Zehui Chen,Huaian Chen,Wanli Ouyang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AGILE is an agentic jigsaw interaction learning method that enhances VLMs' visual perception and reasoning through interactive jigsaw solving, achieving significant performance improvements on jigsaw tasks and strong generalization across vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs have limited fundamental perceptual and reasoning abilities, performing poorly even on simple jigsaw tasks. The scarcity and limited scalability of high-quality vision-language data further constrain their capabilities.

Method: AGILE formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process where the model generates executable code to perform actions based on current state, while the environment provides fine-grained visual feedback. This creates an iterative cycle of observation and interaction for incremental improvement.

Result: AGILE substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks (e.g., increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under 2×2 setting) and demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks with average improvement of 3.1%.

Conclusion: AGILE provides notable enhancements in both perceptual and reasoning abilities, opening a new avenue for advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models while offering an efficient, scalable solution to multimodal reinforcement learning data scarcity.

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

*Darshan Deshpande,Varun Gangal,Hersh Mehta,Anand Kannappan,Rebecca Qian,Peng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEMTRACK is a benchmark for evaluating long-term memory and state tracking in multi-platform agent environments, focusing on realistic organizational workflows across communication tools like Slack, Linear, and Git.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory benchmarks focus on conversational instances, but there's a need for evaluating memory in dynamic enterprise environments to enable effective real-world applications.

Method: MEMTRACK integrates asynchronous events across multiple platforms, creating chronologically interleaved timelines with noisy, conflicting, and cross-referencing information. The dataset is curated through manual expert design and scalable agent-based synthesis.

Result: Experiments show challenges in long-horizon memory utilization, cross-platform dependencies, and contradiction resolution. The best performing GPT-5 model only achieved 60% Correctness score on MEMTRACK.

Conclusion: MEMTRACK provides an extensible framework for advancing memory-augmented agent evaluation beyond conversational setups, enabling multi-agent, multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings.

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A clinical decision support system using Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist prescribing clinicians by analyzing EHR data and generating therapeutic suggestions through a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing complexity of clinical decision-making and leverage the expansion of electronic health records to deliver data-informed care while augmenting clinician judgment rather than replacing it.

Method: Uses a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that integrates natural language processing with structured clinical inputs, harmonizing unstructured narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. Includes representation alignment and generation strategies.

Result: Preliminary evaluations with de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets show promising clinical plausibility and consistency of model outputs. Early findings suggest LLM-based tools can provide valuable decision support in prescribing workflows when properly constrained and validated.

Conclusion: This work represents an initial step toward integrating generative AI into real-world clinical decision-making with emphasis on transparency, safety, and alignment with established practices.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making, alongside the rapid
expansion of electronic health records (EHR), presents both opportunities and
challenges for delivering data-informed care. This paper proposes a clinical
decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist
prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by
analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting
complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories.
The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical
inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing
clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and
synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local
datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs
a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured
narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the
system's technical components, including representation representation
alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with
de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical
plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest
that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing
workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work
represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world
clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and
alignment with established practices.

### [176] [Is It Thinking or Cheating? Detecting Implicit Reward Hacking by Measuring Reasoning Effort](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01367)
*Xinpeng Wang,Nitish Joshi,Barbara Plank,Rico Angell,He He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACE is a method to detect implicit reward hacking in reasoning models by measuring how early in the chain-of-thought the model achieves high verification scores, identifying shortcuts that bypass intended tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward hacking poses a significant threat where models exploit loopholes in reward functions to achieve high rewards without solving intended tasks. This can be implicit (not verbalized in CoT) and bypass current CoT monitors.

Method: TRACE progressively truncates a model's chain-of-thought at various lengths, forces the model to answer, and measures the verifier-passing rate at each cutoff. It quantifies effort by measuring how early reasoning becomes sufficient to pass verification.

Result: TRACE achieves over 65% gains over a 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning and over 30% gains over a 32B monitor in coding. It can also discover unknown loopholes during training.

Conclusion: TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective, providing a way to detect implicit reward hacking that bypasses traditional CoT monitors.

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

*Humaid Ibrahim,Nikolai Rozanov,Marek Rei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A distillation pipeline that converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence by extracting hints from failures, generating improved teacher trajectories, and training students to internalize knowledge without runtime dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents frequently fail in predictable ways during multi-step tasks, and while RAG can help, it requires external knowledge databases and adds computational overhead at every deployment.

Method: Extract compact hints from agent failures, use hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot retrieval at episode start, and train student models on these trajectories with hint strings removed to force internalization.

Result: Distilled students achieve 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% baselines) and 72 WebShop score (vs. 61 baselines), using 10-60% fewer tokens than retrieval-augmented teachers.

Conclusion: Retrieval benefits can be effectively internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime dependencies, generalizing across model scales and agent architectures.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents automate data-driven modeling for regression tasks, achieving performance comparable to human experts on critical heat flux prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional data-driven methods that require extensive manual intervention and lack scalability for large scientific datasets.

Method: Two LLM-agent frameworks: multi-agent system with specialized agents and single-agent ReAct system that autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development, training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification.

Result: LLM-agent-developed model outperforms traditional CHF lookup tables and matches predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification of state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural networks developed by human experts.

Conclusion: LLM-based agents show significant potential to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing performance standards.

Abstract: Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by
experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable,
and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest
in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for
effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional
data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting
their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In
this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model
(LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular
emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a
multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a
single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both
frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,
training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We
validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark,
involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA
benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model
surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ
on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models
developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential
of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly
reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of
predictive performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OntoLogX is an AI agent that uses LLMs to transform raw system logs into structured Knowledge Graphs using ontologies, enabling extraction of actionable cyber threat intelligence and mapping to MITRE ATT&CK tactics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: System logs contain valuable cyber threat intelligence but are limited by lack of structure, semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices, making it difficult to extract actionable insights.

Method: Uses LLMs with Retrieval Augmented Generation and iterative correction to transform raw logs into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs, then aggregates KGs into sessions and predicts MITRE ATT&CK tactics.

Result: Demonstrated robust KG generation across multiple backends and accurate mapping to ATT&CK tactics on both benchmark and real-world honeypot datasets, showing benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall.

Conclusion: Ontology-grounded representations with LLMs enable effective extraction of actionable CTI from system logs, with code-oriented models proving particularly effective for structured log analysis.

Abstract: System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI),
capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of
malicious activity. Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure,
semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions.
Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can
reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable
representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence
(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs
into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a
lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and
semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into
sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level
log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on
both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,
demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate
mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the
benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the
effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value
of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.

*Sipeng Zhang,Longfei Yun,Zilong Wang,Jingbo Shang,Letian Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Falconer is a collaborative framework that combines LLMs' reasoning with lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining, achieving similar accuracy to state-of-the-art LLMs while reducing costs by 90% and accelerating processing by 20x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are expensive to deploy at scale for knowledge mining from massive unstructured text, while traditional pipelines are brittle and cannot generalize to new tasks. There's a need for a solution that combines the strengths of both approaches.

Method: Falconer uses LLMs as planners to decompose user instructions into executable pipelines and as annotators to generate supervision for training small proxy models. It unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations (get label and get span), enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple task-specific components.

Result: Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x.

Conclusion: Falconer offers an efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research by combining the agentic reasoning of LLMs with lightweight proxy models, providing a cost-effective solution for knowledge mining at scale.

Abstract: At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting
structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user
instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such
instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while
traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet
brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a
collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with
lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act
as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as
annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework
unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and
get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple
task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models
incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we
construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.
Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in
instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and
accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an

*Sarath Sreedharan,Kelsey Sikes,Nathaniel Blanchard,Lisa Mason,Nikhil Krishnaswamy,Jill Zarestky*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores how expert-curated knowledge can enhance AI tutoring systems through explainable AI for automatic lesson generation and curriculum-based adaptive tutoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the overlooked role of domain expert knowledge in creating effective AI tutoring systems and demonstrate its potential through novel approaches.

Method: Proposes two approaches: 1) Using expert-specified rules with explainable AI (XAI) techniques to automatically generate lessons, and 2) Leveraging expert-defined curricula to develop adaptive tutoring systems with more efficient algorithms.

Result: Presents a case study on creating a tutoring system for pollinator identification where expert knowledge can be easily elicited and applied.

Conclusion: Expert-curated knowledge plays a crucial role in developing effective AI tutoring systems, enabling automatic lesson generation and adaptive learning experiences through novel XAI applications.

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could
play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI
for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing
two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel
educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI
(XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are
primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could
use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI
techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to
learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning
a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only
provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more
efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the
importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for
pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from
experts.

### [182] [VOGUE: Guiding Exploration with Visual Uncertainty Improves Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01444)
*Rui Liu,Dian Yu,Tong Zheng,Runpeng Dai,Zongxia Li,Wenhao Yu,Zhenwen Liang,Linfeng Song,Haitao Mi,Pratap Tokekar,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VOGUE is a novel RL method that shifts exploration from text to visual space by treating images as stochastic contexts, using symmetric KL divergence to quantify visual uncertainty and guide exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods for MLLMs struggle with exploration and treat visual input as fixed, overlooking visual ambiguity and failing to build policies robust to visual variations.

Method: VOGUE quantifies policy sensitivity to visual perturbations using symmetric KL divergence between raw and noisy image branches, creates uncertainty-proportional bonus for learning objective, combines with token-entropy bonus and annealed sampling schedule.

Result: Boosts pass@1 accuracy by average 2.6% on visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on general-domain reasoning benchmarks, improves pass@4 performance, and mitigates exploration decay in RL fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIReg-Bench is the first benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs' ability to assess compliance with the EU AI Act, created through LLM-generated technical documentation samples and expert legal annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing interest in using LLMs to assess AI system compliance with AI regulations, but no existing benchmarks to evaluate their performance at this task.

Method: Created 120 technical documentation excerpts through LLM prompting depicting plausible AI systems, then had legal experts annotate each sample for AI Act violations.

Result: Established a benchmark dataset with expert-validated compliance labels, enabling evaluation of frontier LLMs' ability to reproduce expert compliance assessments.

Conclusion: AIReg-Bench provides a foundation for understanding LLM-based AI regulation compliance assessment tools and establishes a benchmark for future LLM comparisons.

Abstract: As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a
given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the
performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench:
the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess
compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step
process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we
generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a
fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might
produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then
reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI
system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting
dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce
the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the
opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and
establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

### [184] [Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts Surpasses ToT by Incorporating Logically-Consistent, Low-Utility Candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01500)
*Abhinav Madahar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts (LToT) addresses pathologies in standard Tree-of-Thoughts search by separating utility from logical consistency, treating low-utility but consistent candidates as assets. It uses Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit to efficiently explore wide lateral sets while keeping mainlines narrow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Tree-of-Thoughts search suffers from breadth saturation (additional samples produce near-duplicates) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches with delayed payoffs) when given large test-time compute budgets.

Method: LToT splits the frontier into mainlines (high-utility candidates) and laterals (consistent but low-utility candidates). It explores laterals via Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit: capped successive-halving races with width-aware thresholds and immediate promotion when branches clear mainline thresholds.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows pseudolinear lateral cost Θ(N₀ log_η N₀) with logarithmic rungs, contrasting with exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations are in preparation.

Conclusion: LToT transforms large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating compute requirements.

Abstract: Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands
of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets,
standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth
saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops
growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose
payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts
(LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency
and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste.
The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for
exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that
receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via
Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race
that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware
thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its
envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so
surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear
lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs
(initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the
exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT
turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving
promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating
compute.

### [185] [Towards Interpretable and Inference-Optimal COT Reasoning with Sparse Autoencoder-Guided Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01528)
*Daniel Zhao,Abhilash Shankarampeta,Lanxiang Hu,Tajana Rosing,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method using sparse autoencoders and clustering to analyze LLM token representations for mathematical reasoning, balancing exploitation (following established patterns) and exploration (diverse generation) to improve reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve LLM reasoning by analyzing internal token representations and balancing exploitation of established reasoning patterns with exploration of diverse approaches.

Method: Train sparse autoencoders for token representations, apply k-means clustering to build transition graphs, define reward functions based on edge weights to measure reasoning adherence, and use clustering diversity to assess exploration.

Result: The approach identifies exploitative reasoning trajectories and measures exploration diversity, showing that balancing both is crucial for high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Sparse autoencoders can serve as scalable reward models to guide LLM generations, ensuring balanced exploitation-exploration trade-off that prevents extreme behaviors and fosters higher-quality reasoning processes.

Abstract: We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and
clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large
language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks.
Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for
training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where
vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token
transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function
to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying
exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation
diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings
indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for
achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the
SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a
balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme
behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning
process in LLMs.

### [186] [LOGicalThought: Logic-Based Ontological Grounding of LLMs for High-Assurance Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01530)
*Navapat Nananukul,Yue Zhang,Ryan Lee,Eric Boxer,Jonathan May,Vibhav Giridhar Gogate,Jay Pujara,Mayank Kejriwal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LOGicalThought (LogT) is a neurosymbolic architecture that combines logical reasoning with LLMs to handle defeasible logic in high-assurance domains, achieving significant performance improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-assurance domains like law and medicine require accurate, verifiable reasoning with defeasible logic, but LLMs struggle with the rigorous reasoning needed for exceptions and non-monotonic logic in guidelines.

Method: LogT uses an advanced logical language and reasoner with LLMs to create dual symbolic graph and logic-based contexts, transforming long-form guideline inference into compact grounded evaluation.

Result: LogT improves overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs, with specific gains: +10.2% on negation, +13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the strongest baseline.

Conclusion: The neurosymbolic approach of LogT effectively addresses the challenges of defeasible reasoning in high-assurance domains, significantly outperforming existing methods across multiple reasoning modes.

Abstract: High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and
medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly
grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules,
statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic
due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can
invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in
standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required
over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such
texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation,
implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this
paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called
LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in
conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and
logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem
from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.
Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves
overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves
significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,
+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the
strongest baseline.

### [187] [Information Seeking for Robust Decision Making under Partial Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01531)
*Djengo Cyun-Jyun Fang,Tsung-Wei Ke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InfoSeeker is an LLM decision-making framework that integrates task-oriented planning with active information seeking to handle uncertainty in both observations and environmental dynamics, achieving 74% performance gain over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM planning agents address observational uncertainty but overlook discrepancies between their internal dynamics and the actual environment, which is crucial for robust problem-solving in partially observable environments.

Method: InfoSeeker prompts LLMs to actively gather information by planning actions to validate understanding, detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising task-oriented plans.

Result: InfoSeeker achieves 74% absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample efficiency, and generalizes across LLMs while outperforming baselines on robotic manipulation and web navigation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable environments.

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

### [188] [Step-Aware Policy Optimization for Reasoning in Diffusion Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01544)
*Shaoan Xie,Lingjing Kong,Xiangchen Song,Xinshuai Dong,Guangyi Chen,Eric P. Xing,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Step-Aware Policy Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm for diffusion language models that addresses the problem of unstructured refinement in complex reasoning tasks by aligning the denoising process with hierarchical reasoning structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for diffusion language models rely on sparse, outcome-based rewards that can reinforce flawed reasoning paths leading to coincidentally correct answers, due to a fundamental mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning.

Method: The authors propose a theoretical framework formalizing complex problem solving as hierarchical selection, then introduce SAPO which uses process-based reward functions to encourage incremental progress and align the dLLM's denoising process with latent reasoning hierarchy.

Result: Empirical results show that SAPO significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The principled approach of SAPO successfully addresses the core deficiency of unstructured refinement in diffusion language models, enabling more structured and coherent reasoning paths for complex problem solving.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive
paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a
key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to
coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental
mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a
theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical
selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a
series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a
principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into
the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this
theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's
iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core
deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising
process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward
function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn
structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this
principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning
benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

*Yubin Kim,Taehan Kim,Eugene Park,Chunjong Park,Cynthia Breazeal,Daniel McDuff,Hae Won Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InvThink enables LLMs to perform inverse thinking by reasoning through potential failure modes before generating responses, achieving significant safety improvements while preserving general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment methods directly optimize for safe responses but may compromise general reasoning capabilities. The authors aim to develop a method that proactively considers potential harms before generating outputs.

Method: Instructs models to: 1) enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe outputs that avoid these risks. Implemented via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning across three LLM families.

Result: Achieves up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline methods like SafetyPrompt. Shows stronger safety scaling with model size, mitigates safety tax, and excels in high-stakes domains including medicine, finance, law, and agentic risk scenarios.

Conclusion: Inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable path toward safer, more capable language models by systematically considering failure modes before response generation.

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdvEvo-MARL is a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that internalizes safety into task agents through adversarial training, eliminating the need for external guard modules while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses for LLM-based multi-agent systems either use self-verification (which underperforms due to limited detection capacity) or external guard modules (which create single-point-of-failure risks and increase system overhead).

Method: Jointly optimizes attackers (synthesizing jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to accomplish duties while resisting attacks) in adversarial learning environments, using a public baseline for advantage estimation with group-level mean-return baselines.

Result: Consistently keeps attack-success rate below 20% (vs. 38.33% for baselines) while preserving and sometimes improving task accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks).

Conclusion: Safety and utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added system overhead through adversarial co-evolutionary training.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role
coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to
jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses
fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter
unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that
police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent
lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and
delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a
single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and
adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we
propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on
external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize
evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both
accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning
environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a
public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional
group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates
and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,
AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas
baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task
accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and
utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added
system overhead.

TL;DR: AgentRec is a multi-agent LLM framework that improves conversational recommendation by handling dynamic preferences, maintaining coherence, and balancing multiple ranking objectives through specialized agents and adaptive coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conversational recommender systems struggle with dynamic user preferences, conversation coherence, and balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously.

Method: Uses hierarchical LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context awareness, and dynamic ranking with adaptive weighting mechanism and three-tier learning strategy (rapid response, intelligent reasoning, deep collaboration).

Result: Achieves 2.8% improvement in conversation success rate, 1.9% enhancement in recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2% better conversation efficiency while maintaining comparable computational costs.

Conclusion: AgentRec demonstrates that multi-agent collaborative frameworks with adaptive intelligence can effectively address key challenges in conversational recommendation systems.

Abstract: Interactive conversational recommender systems have gained significant
attention for their ability to capture user preferences through natural
language interactions. However, existing approaches face substantial challenges
in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and
balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces
AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative
recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical
agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized
LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context
awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting
mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier
learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent
reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging
scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that
AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with
2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in
recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency
while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent
coordination.

*Min Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces PsychoBench, a benchmark based on U.S. national counselor certification exams to evaluate whether LLMs can qualify as psychological counselors by testing their psychological knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can be effectively applied to psychological counseling by assessing if they meet the qualification standards required for professional counselors, specifically the ability to pass certification exams.

Method: Created PsychoBench, a comprehensive benchmark with approximately 2,252 single-choice questions derived from U.S. national counselor examinations, covering various psychology sub-disciplines and requiring deep understanding.

Result: Advanced models like GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieved well above the 70% passing threshold, while smaller open-source models (Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B) performed far below the passing standard.

Conclusion: Only frontier LLMs currently meet counseling exam standards, highlighting both the promise and challenges in developing psychology-oriented LLMs for counseling applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: LLM-based summarization approach for Contextual Markov Decision Processes that compresses high-dimensional contexts into low-dimensional summaries to improve decision-making efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CMDP methods struggle with high-dimensional contexts, leading to computational inefficiency and unstable performance. There's a need for scalable approaches that can handle unstructured contextual inputs effectively.

Method: Information-theoretic summarization using LLMs to compress contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries that preserve decision-critical information while reducing redundancy.

Result: Outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines across various benchmarks, improving reward, success rate, sample efficiency while reducing latency and memory usage. Provides first regret bounds and latency-entropy trade-off characterization.

Conclusion: LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich, resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) offer a framework for sequential
decision-making under external signals, but existing methods often fail to
generalize in high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, resulting in excessive
computation and unstable performance. We propose an information-theoretic
summarization approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to compress
contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries. These
summaries augment states by preserving decision-critical cues while reducing
redundancy. Building on the notion of approximate context sufficiency, we
provide, to our knowledge, the first regret bounds and a latency-entropy
trade-off characterization for CMDPs. Our analysis clarifies how
informativeness impacts computational cost. Experiments across discrete,
continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks show that our method
outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines, improving reward, success
rate, and sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage. These
findings demonstrate that LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich,
resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: To explore the geospatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models in understanding road networks and performing navigation tasks without external tools.

Method: Framed trajectory recovery as a proxy task using GLOBALTRACE dataset with 4,000+ real-world trajectories, employing a prompting framework that enables LLMs to generate valid paths using road network context.

Result: LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized trajectory recovery models, showing strong comprehension of road networks and coordinate systems, though with systematic biases across regions and transportation modes.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively enhance navigation experiences by reasoning over maps flexibly to incorporate user preferences, demonstrating strong geospatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We explore the geospatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically, whether LLMs can read road network maps and perform
navigation. We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models
to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with
over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation
modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to
generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools.
Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized
trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained
analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and
coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and
transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation
experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user
preferences.

*Erfan Shayegani,Keegan Hines,Yue Dong,Nael Abu-Ghazaleh,Roman Lutz,Spencer Whitehead,Vidhisha Balachandran,Besmira Nushi,Vibhav Vineet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD) - pursuing goals regardless of feasibility, safety, or context. The paper introduces BLIND-ACT benchmark to evaluate BGD patterns and shows high BGD rates (80.8%) across frontier models, highlighting safety risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CUAs are increasingly deployed but consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD) - pursuing goals without considering feasibility, safety, reliability, or context, creating subtle risks even with non-harmful inputs.

Method: Developed BLIND-ACT benchmark with 90 tasks capturing three BGD patterns: lack of contextual reasoning, assumptions under ambiguity, and infeasible goals. Uses OSWorld environments and LLM-based judges (93.75% human agreement) to evaluate nine frontier models.

Result: High average BGD rates (80.8%) across all tested models including Claude Sonnet/Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5. Prompting interventions reduce BGD but substantial risk persists. Identified failure modes: execution-first bias, thought-action disconnect, and request-primacy.

Conclusion: BGD exposes fundamental risks in CUAs that require stronger training- or inference-time interventions beyond prompting. BLIND-ACT establishes foundation for studying and mitigating this risk to ensure safe CUA deployment.

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LENOHA is a safety-first clinical system that uses high-precision classification to route patient queries to verbatim FAQ answers instead of free-text generation, achieving near-frontier accuracy with 170x lower energy consumption than generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of providing personalized pre-procedural counseling to patients while respecting time constraints, privacy requirements, and avoiding potential errors from free-text generation in clinical settings.

Method: Uses a sentence-transformer classifier to route inputs and returns verbatim answers from clinician-curated FAQs, eliminating free-text generation in the clinical path. Evaluated with E5-large-instruct encoder on tooth extraction and gastroscopy domains using expert-reviewed validation and test sets.

Result: Achieved overall accuracy of 0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996 with only 7 total errors, statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o. Non-generative clinical path consumes ~1.0 mWh per input vs ~168 mWh for generative models (170x difference) while maintaining ~0.10 s latency.

Conclusion: The approach structurally avoids generation-induced errors by returning vetted FAQ answers verbatim, supporting privacy, sustainability, and equitable deployment in bandwidth-limited clinical environments.

Abstract: Patients awaiting invasive procedures often have unanswered pre-procedural
questions; however, time-pressured workflows and privacy constraints limit
personalized counseling. We present LENOHA (Low Energy, No Hallucination, Leave
No One Behind Architecture), a safety-first, local-first system that routes
inputs with a high-precision sentence-transformer classifier and returns
verbatim answers from a clinician-curated FAQ for clinical queries, eliminating
free-text generation in the clinical path. We evaluated two domains (tooth
extraction and gastroscopy) using expert-reviewed validation sets
(n=400/domain) for thresholding and independent test sets (n=200/domain). Among
the four encoders, E5-large-instruct (560M) achieved an overall accuracy of
0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996, and seven total errors, which were
statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o on this task; Gemini made no errors
on this test set. Energy logging shows that the non-generative clinical path
consumes ~1.0 mWh per input versus ~168 mWh per small-talk reply from a local
8B SLM, a ~170x difference, while maintaining ~0.10 s latency on a single
on-prem GPU. These results indicate that near-frontier discrimination and
generation-induced errors are structurally avoided in the clinical path by
returning vetted FAQ answers verbatim, supporting privacy, sustainability, and
equitable deployment in bandwidth-limited environments.

TL;DR: The paper critiques current AGI evaluation methods based on synthetic tasks and proposes an alternative approach focused on robust task execution and deployment competence, drawing from data science practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AGI evaluation methods are inadequate because they rely on synthetic tasks based on human intuitions about intelligence, which have historically performed poorly in AI development.

Method: The paper argues for a shift in evaluation philosophy - from synthetic task-based assessment to measuring robust task execution and deployment competence, using principles from data science practices.

Result: The authors provide practical examples of what this alternative AGI evaluation approach would look like, though specific results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: AGI evaluation should move away from synthetic tasks and instead focus on demonstrating robust task execution and deployment competence, following data science evaluation practices.

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VaPR introduces a hard-negative response generation framework using LLM-guided editing to address noise in synthetic preference annotations, creating a 30K-sample dataset that significantly improves LVLM performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference finetuning methods overlook noise in synthetic preference annotations, particularly stylistic and length biases that affect alignment quality.

Method: LLM-guided response editing framework that generates hard-negative rejected responses with targeted errors while maintaining stylistic and length similarity to accepted responses.

Result: VaPR models achieved average gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL) across ten benchmarks, with notable improvements on reasoning tasks and reduced 'Yes' bias in binary questions.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses synthetic annotation noise, scales well with data size, and generalizes to open-source LLMs, achieving near-GPT-4o performance.

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook
the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of
stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response
generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces
rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length
similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR
dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families:
LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver
significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average
gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable
improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance
consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at
smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary
questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we
show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models
trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on
\name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MetaboT is an AI system using large language models to translate natural language questions into SPARQL queries for metabolomics knowledge graphs, achieving 83.67% accuracy compared to 8.16% for standard LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge graphs effectively structure mass spectrometry metabolomics data but require deep understanding of ontology and query languages, creating barriers for researchers.

Method: Multi-agent system using LangChain/LangGraph with specialized agents for validation, chemical conversion, and SPARQL query generation from natural language questions.

Result: Achieved 83.67% accuracy on curated metabolomics questions, significantly outperforming standard LLM baseline (8.16%), demonstrating effective automated query generation.

Conclusion: MetaboT successfully bridges semantic technologies and user interaction, enabling researchers to access structured metabolomics data through natural language while maintaining domain-specific standards.

Abstract: Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast amounts of data requiring
advanced methods for interpretation. Knowledge graphs address these challenges
by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their
relationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective
use of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and
its query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system
utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL
semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).
We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products
Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural
products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for
handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down
complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent
(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and
LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external
tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process
follows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the
question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are
forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to
the knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,
which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized
identifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph
Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or
taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent
responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the
knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the
system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph
and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance
of MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected
answers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a
baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that
incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity
IDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,
underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving
entities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising
performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling
researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language
queries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it
removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge
graphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while
maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs
remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This
approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between
complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction. MetaboT is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of building effective and ethical human-AI teaming systems in complex military environments by focusing on internal dynamics rather than external collective agent perspective.

Method: Designs a co-learning model featuring: 1) adjustable autonomy based on mission state and confidence, 2) multi-layered control for oversight and accountability, 3) bidirectional feedback loops for communication, and 4) collaborative decision-making with confidence levels.

Result: Provides concrete exemplifications and recommendations for developing responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.

Conclusion: The proposed model enables continuous bidirectional exchange of insights between human and AI agents, allowing joint adaptation to evolving battlefield conditions while addressing responsibility, safety, and robustness concerns.

Abstract: In a time of rapidly evolving military threats and increasingly complex
operational environments, the integration of AI into military operations proves
significant advantages. At the same time, this implies various challenges and
risks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective
and ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often
tackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as
a collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the
system assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional
responsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research
proposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in
military operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of
insights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving
battlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First,
adjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents
depending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental
uncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight,
monitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback
with explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper
communication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of
the agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the
generation, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence
levels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete
exemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing
responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.

TL;DR: PTA-GRPO is a two-stage framework that improves LLM reasoning by first generating high-level guidance from CoT reasoning, then using guidance-aware RL to jointly optimize final outputs and guidance quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning is constrained to local token-level decisions without global planning, leading to redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate reasoning. Existing approaches like tree-based algorithms and RL have high computational costs and fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Use advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance for supervised fine-tuning, 2) Guidance-aware RL that jointly optimizes final output and high-level guidance quality.

Result: Extensive experiments on MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC benchmarks with models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and LLaMA3.2-3B show consistent and significant improvements across different models and tasks.

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO effectively enhances both high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning, demonstrating stable performance improvements and good generalization across various models and mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adversarial IRL is applied to LLM reasoning to learn dense, token-level rewards from expert demonstrations, enabling step-level feedback during training and inference-time reranking to improve reasoning correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond style imitation via supervised fine-tuning and instead learn reasoning rewards that prioritize correctness over surface form, enabling better process supervision and error localization.

Method: Reframe adversarial inverse reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning, learning dense token-level reward models from expert demonstrations that provide step-level feedback during training and serve as critics for reranking sampled traces at inference.

Result: The approach yields scores correlating with answer validity, enables interpretable error localization, and empirically improves predictive performance on GSM8K with Llama3 and Qwen2.5 backbones through reward-guided reranking.

Conclusion: Dense reasoning rewards unify training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level diagnostics, suggesting reusable process-level rewards with broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in language models.

Abstract: We reframe and operationalise adversarial inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) to large language model reasoning, learning a dense, token-level reward
model for process supervision directly from expert demonstrations rather than
imitating style via supervised fine-tuning. The learned reasoning reward serves
two complementary roles: (i) it provides step-level feedback to optimise a
reasoning policy during training; and (ii) it functions at inference as a
critic to rerank sampled traces under fixed compute budgets. We demonstrate
that our approach prioritises correctness over surface form, yielding scores
that correlate with eventual answer validity and enabling interpretable
localisation of errors within a trace. Empirically, on GSM8K with Llama3 and
Qwen2.5 backbones, we demonstrate: (i) dense reasoning rewards can be used as a
learning signal to elicit reasoning, and (ii) predictive performance is
improved from reward-guided reranking (notably for Llama-based policies). By
unifying training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level
diagnostics into a single reasoning reward, this work suggests reusable
process-level rewards with broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in
language models.

### [206] [Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01902)
*Paweł Parys,Sairam Vaidya,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Loris D'Antoni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CARS is a constrained generation method that improves rejection sampling efficiency by adaptively pruning invalid continuations while preserving the LM's distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing constrained generation methods either distort LM distributions (greedy decoding) or waste computation (rejection sampling), which is problematic for domains requiring both validity and diversity.

Method: CARS uses unconstrained LM sampling and adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws.

Result: CARS achieves higher efficiency (fewer LM forward passes per valid sample) and produces stronger sample diversity compared to GCD and other approximation methods.

Conclusion: CARS strictly improves rejection sampling efficiency without distributional distortion, making it suitable for domains like program fuzzing and molecular generation where both validity and diversity are essential.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

*Crystal Qian,Aaron Parisi,Clémentine Bouleau,Vivian Tsai,Maël Lebreton,Lucas Dixon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show varied alignment with human collective reasoning in social decision-making tasks, with some mirroring human biases while others attempt to compensate for them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how large language models align with human social reasoning in collective decision-making contexts, moving beyond individual-level analysis.

Method: Conducted large-scale online experiment (N=748) using Lost at Sea social psychology task, randomly assigning groups to leader elections with visible demographic attributes vs pseudonymous aliases, then simulated matched LLM groups conditioned on human data.

Result: LLM behaviors diverged significantly - some mirrored human biases while others masked these biases and attempted to compensate for them. Human-AI alignment in collective reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases.

Conclusion: Understanding LLM alignment with collective human behavior is critical for socially-aligned AI, requiring dynamic benchmarks that capture the complexities of collective reasoning.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model and augment
collective decision-making, it is critical to examine their alignment with
human social reasoning. We present an empirical framework for assessing
collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using
the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online
experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either
visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We
then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking
Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some
mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for
them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective
reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases.
Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to
advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the
complexities of collective reasoning.

*Khalid M. Saqr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A deterministic simulation framework provides stable, evidence-based standards for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports, addressing the dual crisis of unmanageable submission volumes and unregulated AI in scholarly publishing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces unmanageable submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. Traditional human-only peer review lacks scalable, objective benchmarks.

Method: Deterministic simulation framework analyzing 352 peer-review simulation reports to identify consistent system state indicators and evaluate AI-generated peer review reports.

Result: The system demonstrates calibrated editorial judgment with 'Revise' decisions forming majority outcomes (>50%) across disciplines, while 'Reject' rates adapt to field-specific norms (up to 45% in Health Sciences). It maintains 29% evidence-anchoring compliance rate invariant across review tasks and domains.

Conclusion: The framework provides a transparent tool for ensuring fairness in scientific publishing and offers scalable instruments for auditing workflows, managing integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance, repositioning AI as essential for institutional accountability.

Abstract: The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces a dual crisis of unmanageable
submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new
governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. The traditional human-only
peer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial
processes opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic
simulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard
for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review
simulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that
demonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated
editorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority
outcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt
to field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains
unwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring
compliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and
scientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably
rule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific
community, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing
strategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing
integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance. The framework
repositions AI as an essential component of institutional accountability,
providing the critical infrastructure to maintain trust in scholarly
communication.

### [209] [ReTabAD: A Benchmark for Restoring Semantic Context in Tabular Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02060)
*Sanghyu Yoon,Dongmin Kim,Suhee Yoon,Ye Seul Sim,Seungdong Yoa,Hye-Seung Cho,Soonyoung Lee,Hankook Lee,Woohyung Lim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReTabAD introduces a benchmark for tabular anomaly detection that incorporates textual semantics and domain context, which are missing in existing datasets, along with implementations of various AD algorithms and a zero-shot LLM framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tabular AD benchmarks lack textual semantics and domain context that experts use in practice, limiting research flexibility and preventing models from fully leveraging domain knowledge for detection.

Method: Created 20 curated tabular datasets enriched with structured textual metadata, implemented state-of-the-art AD algorithms (classical, deep learning, and LLM-based), and developed a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without task-specific training.

Result: Semantic context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by supporting domain-aware reasoning.

Conclusion: ReTabAD establishes a benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware anomaly detection, demonstrating the value of textual metadata in improving AD performance and interpretability.

Abstract: In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical
signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific
context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without
semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature
descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This
limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully
leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by
restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We
provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured
textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD
algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and
(2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without
task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research.
Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual
metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic
context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by
supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a
benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

### [210] [Demystifying the Roles of LLM Layers in Retrieval, Knowledge, and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02091)
*Xinyuan Song,Keyu Wang,PengXiang Li,Lu Yin,Shiwei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Deep layers in LLMs show varied importance depending on evaluation methods - pruning works for likelihood metrics but middle/deeper layers are crucial for reasoning and coherence in generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate claims that deep layers in LLMs are unnecessary, examining depth utilization across different evaluation protocols, tasks, and model architectures.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of depth utilization through diverse evaluation dimensions including likelihood-based metrics vs generation-based evaluation, different task categories, and various model architectures.

Result: Deep layers show minimal contribution under likelihood-based metrics but are indispensable for reasoning and long-range coherence in generation tasks. Knowledge and retrieval concentrate in shallow layers while reasoning requires deeper layers but can be reshaped via distillation.

Conclusion: Depth usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, requiring task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives for proper interpretation and compression.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs)
contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without
significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from
narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In
this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse
dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model
architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less
effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with
the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,
pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being
critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles
for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range
coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in
shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers
-- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth
usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the
need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and
compressing large models.

### [211] [Do AI Models Perform Human-like Abstract Reasoning Across Modalities?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02125)
*Claas Beger,Ryan Yi,Shuhao Fu,Arseny Moskvichev,Sarah W. Tsai,Sivasankaran Rajamanickam,Melanie Mitchell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: While AI models achieve high accuracy on ConceptARC benchmark, they often use surface-level shortcuts rather than true abstract reasoning. Text-based models match human accuracy but lack intended abstractions, while visual models show better abstraction understanding but struggle with application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether state-of-the-art AI models truly understand and reason with the intended abstractions in ConceptARC tasks, rather than just achieving high accuracy through surface-level patterns.

Method: Evaluated models on ConceptARC with varying input modalities (textual vs visual), external tool usage, and reasoning effort. Performed dual evaluation of both output accuracy and natural-language rule explanations to assess abstraction understanding.

Result: Text-based models match human accuracy but their rules often rely on surface-level shortcuts rather than intended abstractions. Visual models show lower accuracy but exhibit substantial share of rules capturing intended abstractions, though they struggle to apply them correctly.

Conclusion: Models still lag humans in abstract reasoning. Accuracy alone overestimates abstract reasoning in textual modalities and underestimates it in visual modalities. The proposed evaluation framework provides more faithful assessment of multimodal abstract reasoning abilities.

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

TL;DR: FlexDoc is a scalable synthetic data generation framework that creates realistic multilingual semi-structured documents with rich annotations to address the high costs and privacy constraints of collecting real document data for enterprise document understanding models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing document understanding models requires large, diverse datasets, but collecting real data is prohibitively expensive due to privacy constraints, legal restrictions, and high manual annotation costs that can reach millions of dollars.

Method: FlexDoc combines Stochastic Schemas and Parameterized Sampling to probabilistically model layout patterns, visual structure, and content variability, enabling controlled generation of diverse document variants at scale.

Result: Experiments on Key Information Extraction (KIE) tasks show FlexDoc-generated data improves absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when augmenting real datasets, while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional hard-template methods.

Conclusion: FlexDoc is actively deployed and has accelerated enterprise-grade document understanding model development while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs.

Abstract: Developing document understanding models at enterprise scale requires large,
diverse, and well-annotated datasets spanning a wide range of document types.
However, collecting such data is prohibitively expensive due to privacy
constraints, legal restrictions, and the sheer volume of manual annotation
needed - costs that can scale into millions of dollars. We introduce FlexDoc, a
scalable synthetic data generation framework that combines Stochastic Schemas
and Parameterized Sampling to produce realistic, multilingual semi-structured
documents with rich annotations. By probabilistically modeling layout patterns,
visual structure, and content variability, FlexDoc enables the controlled
generation of diverse document variants at scale. Experiments on Key
Information Extraction (KIE) tasks demonstrate that FlexDoc-generated data
improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets,
while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional
hard-template methods. The solution is in active deployment, where it has
accelerated the development of enterprise-grade document understanding models
while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs.

*Yang Yao,Yixu Wang,Yuxuan Zhang,Yi Lu,Tianle Gu,Lingyu Li,Dingyi Zhao,Keming Wu,Haozhe Wang,Ping Nie,Yan Teng,Yingchun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a specialized benchmark and evaluation framework for Deep Research Agents (DRAs) to address limitations in existing assessment methods for AI agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to effectively assess interconnected agent systems like DRAs that perform complex tasks through task decomposition, cross-source retrieval, and multi-stage reasoning.

Method: The authors developed a rigorous benchmark comprising 214 expert-curated challenging queries across 10 thematic domains, with manually constructed reference bundles. They also created a multidimensional evaluation framework for long-form reports with integrated scoring metrics for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness.

Result: Extensive experimentation showed that mainstream DRAs outperform web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, but there is still considerable room for improvement in their performance.

Conclusion: This study provides a robust foundation for capability assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems, establishing a comprehensive evaluation standard for interconnected AI agent systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

*Yuhao Sun,Zhuoer Xu,Shiwen Cui,Kun Yang,Lingyun Yu,Yongdong Zhang,Hongtao Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UpSafe°C is a unified framework that enhances LLM safety through safety-aware upcycling, converting safety-critical layers into sparse Mixture-of-Experts with safety experts and a router-based soft guardrail, enabling dynamic inference-time control via safety temperature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM safety techniques face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability, with vulnerabilities to harmful content generation and jailbreak attacks.

Method: Identify safety-critical layers and upcycle them into sparse MoE structure with router as soft guardrail; use two-stage SFT strategy; introduce safety temperature mechanism for dynamic inference-time control.

Result: Achieves robust safety improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs while maintaining competitive performance on general tasks; safety temperature provides Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety.

Conclusion: Moves LLM safety from static alignment toward dynamic, modular, and inference-aware control, offering a new direction for balancing safety and utility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide
range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content
generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including
external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment --
each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In
this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM
safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates
original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT
strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general
capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a
safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off
between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model,
and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety
improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining
competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety
temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the
Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new
direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular,
and inference-aware control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards) paradoxically shrinks reasoning boundaries in LLMs due to negative interference and winner-take-all phenomena, but a data curation algorithm focusing on low-likelihood problems improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why RLVR, despite being designed to improve LLM reasoning, actually shrinks reasoning boundaries and understand the underlying learning dynamics causing this failure.

Method: Analyzed RLVR learning dynamics through theoretical and empirical analysis on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, identifying negative interference and winner-take-all phenomena, then proposed a data curation algorithm that focuses learning on low-likelihood problems.

Result: Found that RLVR causes negative interference (learning some problems reduces solution likelihood for others) and winner-take-all effect (reinforces high-likelihood problems while suppressing low-likelihood ones), leading to Pass@k performance decline. The proposed data curation algorithm achieved notable improvement in Pass@k performance.

Conclusion: RLVR's shrinkage effect stems from inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL objectives, causing convergence toward narrow solution strategies. Focusing learning on low-likelihood problems through data curation effectively mitigates this issue and improves reasoning performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at

*Gonzalo Gonzalez-Pumariega,Vincent Tu,Chih-Lun Lee,Jiachen Yang,Ang Li,Xin Eric Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN) is a scaling method that improves computer-use agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting the best using behavior narratives, achieving near-human performance on complex digital tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer-use agents are unreliable and have high variance, which limits their application to long-horizon, complex digital tasks.

Method: Generate multiple agent rollouts and select among them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' execution paths, enabling both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection.

Result: Achieves 69.9% success rate on OSWorld (approaching 72% human-level), establishes new state-of-the-art, and demonstrates strong generalization across WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld.

Conclusion: Scaling computer-use agents effectively requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN provides a practical framework to achieve this, highlighting the unreasonable effectiveness of proper scaling methods.

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

*Yuxiao Qu,Anikait Singh,Yoonho Lee,Amrith Setlur,Ruslan Salakhutdinov,Chelsea Finn,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces reasoning abstractions - concise natural language descriptions of procedural knowledge that guide models toward effective reasoning, and proposes RLAD, a two-player RL training paradigm that jointly trains an abstraction generator and solution generator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning traces in large models often fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into verbose and degenerate exploration. The goal is to enable more effective reasoning by identifying and implementing algorithmic procedures.

Method: RLAD (two-player RL training) that jointly trains an abstraction generator to propose multiple abstractions given a problem, and a solution generator that uses these abstractions to build solutions. This decouples learning signals and enables structured exploration.

Result: The approach improves generalization to harder problems and shows that allocating more test-time compute to generating abstractions is more beneficial than generating more solutions at large test budgets.

Conclusion: Reasoning abstractions effectively guide meaningful exploration and enable structured reasoning, with the two-player RL setup providing an effective training paradigm for learning algorithmic procedures.

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

### [218] [BioX-Bridge: Model Bridging for Unsupervised Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer across Biosignals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02276)
*Chenqi Li,Yu Liu,Timothy Denison,Tingting Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BioX-Bridge is a framework for unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals using lightweight bridge networks to align foundation model representations across modalities, achieving 88-99% parameter reduction while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biosignals are intercorrelated but face limited labeled datasets. Unsupervised cross-modal transfer can improve health monitoring accessibility, but existing methods have high computational overhead, especially with foundation models.

Method: Train lightweight bridge network to align intermediate representations between foundation models across modalities. Uses efficient alignment position selection and flexible prototype network as bridge architecture.

Result: Reduces trainable parameters by 88-99% while maintaining or improving transfer performance across multiple biosignal modalities, tasks, and datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: BioX-Bridge provides an efficient framework for cross-modal knowledge transfer that significantly reduces computational requirements while preserving performance, making foundation model transfer more practical for biosignal applications.

Abstract: Biosignals offer valuable insights into the physiological states of the human
body. Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,
sensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the
holistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the
possibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal
modalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of
health monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled
datasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and
modalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a
promising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support
model training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on
knowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside
student model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.
This challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation
models that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at
the cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for
unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a
lightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable
information flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,
we introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the
bridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the
bridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignal
modalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number of
trainable parameters by 88--99\% while maintaining or even improving transfer
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
