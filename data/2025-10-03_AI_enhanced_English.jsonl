Knowledge graphs address these challenges\nby structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their\nrelationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective\nuse of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and\nits query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system\nutilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL\nsemantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products\nKnowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural\nproducts (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for\nhandling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down\ncomplex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent\n(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and\nLangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external\ntools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process\nfollows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the\nquestion is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are\nforwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to\nthe knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,\nwhich identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized\nidentifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph\nAgent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or\ntaxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent\nresponsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the\nknowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the\nsystem executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph\nand returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance\nof MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected\nanswers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a\nbaseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that\nincorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity\nIDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,\nunderscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving\nentities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising\nperformance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling\nresearchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language\nqueries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it\nremoves technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge\ngraphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while\nmaintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs\nremain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular\nframework for question answering that is powered by two large language models\n(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database\nthat are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the\nretrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and\ngenerator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on\na new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and\nbenefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning\nstrategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our\nexperiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal\nimprovement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have\nsignificantly different computational costs.
