### [2] [A Multimodal RAG Framework for Housing Damage Assessment: Collaborative Optimization of Image Encoding and Policy Vector Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09721)
*Jiayi Miao,Dingxin Lu,Zhuqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal RAG framework for post-disaster housing damage assessment that combines visual building damage analysis with text retrieval from insurance policies, achieving 9.6% improvement in retrieval accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate housing damage evaluation after natural disasters is crucial for insurance claims and resource planning, requiring effective integration of visual damage assessment with policy information retrieval.

Method: Two-branch multimodal encoder with ResNet+Transformer for images and BERT for text, cross-modal attention for alignment, modal attention gating for generation control, and multi-task optimization with comparison, retrieval, and generation losses.

Result: Superior performance in retrieval accuracy and damage severity classification, with 9.6% improvement in Top-1 retrieval accuracy.

Conclusion: The MM-RAG framework effectively integrates visual and textual information for comprehensive post-disaster damage assessment, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy through multimodal collaborative learning.

Abstract: After natural disasters, accurate evaluations of damage to housing are
important for insurance claims response and planning of resources. In this
work, we introduce a novel multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG)
framework. On top of classical RAG architecture, we further the framework to
devise a two-branch multimodal encoder structure that the image branch employs
a visual encoder composed of ResNet and Transformer to extract the
characteristic of building damage after disaster, and the text branch harnesses
a BERT retriever for the text vectorization of posts as well as insurance
policies and for the construction of a retrievable restoration index. To impose
cross-modal semantic alignment, the model integrates a cross-modal interaction
module to bridge the semantic representation between image and text via
multi-head attention. Meanwhile, in the generation module, the introduced modal
attention gating mechanism dynamically controls the role of visual evidence and
text prior information during generation. The entire framework takes end-to-end
training, and combines the comparison loss, the retrieval loss and the
generation loss to form multi-task optimization objectives, and achieves image
understanding and policy matching in collaborative learning. The results
demonstrate superior performance in retrieval accuracy and classification index
on damage severity, where the Top-1 retrieval accuracy has been improved by
9.6%.

*Taylor Archibald,Tony Martinez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ensemble framework using Gemini 2.0 Flash with multiple augmented image variants and custom Needleman-Wunsch aligner improves transcription accuracy by 4% on historical documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To stabilize LLM-based text extraction from noisy historical documents by reducing errors and providing confidence scores for transcriptions.

Method: Transcribe multiple augmented variants of each document image using Gemini 2.0 Flash, then fuse outputs with a custom Needleman-Wunsch style aligner to produce consensus transcription and confidence score.

Result: 4 percentage point improvement in transcription accuracy on a dataset of 622 Pennsylvania death records; padding and blurring most effective for accuracy, grid warp best for confidence separation.

Conclusion: The approach is simple, scalable, and immediately deployable to other document collections and transcription models for improved historical document processing.

Abstract: We present a novel ensemble framework that stabilizes LLM based text
extraction from noisy historical documents. We transcribe multiple augmented
variants of each image with Gemini 2.0 Flash and fuse these outputs with a
custom Needleman Wunsch style aligner that yields both a consensus
transcription and a confidence score. We present a new dataset of 622
Pennsylvania death records, and demonstrate our method improves transcription
accuracy by 4 percentage points relative to a single shot baseline. We find
that padding and blurring are the most useful for improving accuracy, while
grid warp perturbations are best for separating high and low confidence cases.
The approach is simple, scalable, and immediately deployable to other document
collections and transcription models.

*Kaikai Zhao,Zhaoxiang Liu,Peng Wang,Xin Wang,Zhicheng Ma,Yajun Xu,Wenjing Zhang,Yibing Nan,Kai Wang,Shiguo Lian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MITS is the first large-scale multimodal benchmark dataset for Intelligent Traffic Surveillance (ITS), containing 170,400 real-world traffic images with comprehensive annotations and 5 million QA pairs, which significantly improves LMM performance in ITS applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-domain large multimodal models (LMMs) underperform in ITS applications due to the lack of dedicated multimodal datasets specifically designed for traffic surveillance tasks.

Method: Created MITS dataset with 170,400 real-world ITS images annotated with 8 main categories and 24 subcategories, plus generated high-quality captions and 5 million instruction-following QA pairs covering five critical ITS tasks. Fine-tuned mainstream LMMs on this dataset.

Result: MITS dramatically improved LMM performance: LLaVA-1.5 increased from 0.494 to 0.905 (+83.2%), LLaVA-1.6 from 0.678 to 0.921 (+35.8%), Qwen2-VL from 0.584 to 0.926 (+58.6%), and Qwen2.5-VL from 0.732 to 0.930 (+27.0%).

Conclusion: MITS effectively bridges the gap in ITS multimodal data and significantly enhances LMM performance for traffic surveillance applications, providing valuable open-source resources for both ITS and LMM research communities.

Abstract: General-domain large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved significant
advances in various image-text tasks. However, their performance in the
Intelligent Traffic Surveillance (ITS) domain remains limited due to the
absence of dedicated multimodal datasets. To address this gap, we introduce
MITS (Multimodal Intelligent Traffic Surveillance), the first large-scale
multimodal benchmark dataset specifically designed for ITS. MITS includes
170,400 independently collected real-world ITS images sourced from traffic
surveillance cameras, annotated with eight main categories and 24 subcategories
of ITS-specific objects and events under diverse environmental conditions.
Additionally, through a systematic data generation pipeline, we generate
high-quality image captions and 5 million instruction-following visual
question-answer pairs, addressing five critical ITS tasks: object and event
recognition, object counting, object localization, background analysis, and
event reasoning. To demonstrate MITS's effectiveness, we fine-tune mainstream
LMMs on this dataset, enabling the development of ITS-specific applications.
Experimental results show that MITS significantly improves LMM performance in
ITS applications, increasing LLaVA-1.5's performance from 0.494 to 0.905
(+83.2%), LLaVA-1.6's from 0.678 to 0.921 (+35.8%), Qwen2-VL's from 0.584 to
0.926 (+58.6%), and Qwen2.5-VL's from 0.732 to 0.930 (+27.0%). We release the
dataset, code, and models as open-source, providing high-value resources to
advance both ITS and LMM research.

### [5] [Decomposing Visual Classification: Assessing Tree-Based Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09732)
*Sary Elmansoury,Islam Mesabah,Gerrit Großmann,Peter Neigel,Raj Bhalwankar,Daniel Kondermann,Sebastian J. Vollmer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Tree-based reasoning for VLMs underperforms standard zero-shot prompting despite achieving high accuracy in understanding tree structure, though adding image descriptions improves both methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether structured, tree-based reasoning can enhance VLM performance on fine-grained tasks and large hierarchical label spaces, which is currently understudied.

Method: Introduces a framework that decomposes classification into interpretable decisions using decision trees, evaluated on fine-grained (GTSRB) and coarse-grained (CIFAR-10) datasets. Also explores enhancing tree prompts with LLM-generated classes and image descriptions.

Result: Tree-based reasoning consistently underperforms standard zero-shot prompting despite 98.2% accuracy in understanding tree knowledge. Adding image descriptions enhances performance for both tree-based and zero-shot methods.

Conclusion: Highlights limitations of structured reasoning in visual classification and offers insights for designing more interpretable VLM systems.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) excel at zero-shot visual classification, but
their performance on fine-grained tasks and large hierarchical label spaces is
understudied. This paper investigates whether structured, tree-based reasoning
can enhance VLM performance. We introduce a framework that decomposes
classification into interpretable decisions using decision trees and evaluates
it on fine-grained (GTSRB) and coarse-grained (CIFAR-10) datasets. Although the
model achieves 98.2% accuracy in understanding the tree knowledge, tree-based
reasoning consistently underperforms standard zero-shot prompting. We also
explore enhancing the tree prompts with LLM-generated classes and image
descriptions to improve alignment. The added description enhances the
performance of the tree-based and zero-shot methods. Our findings highlight
limitations of structured reasoning in visual classification and offer insights
for designing more interpretable VLM systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSI is a system that learns controllable world models through a 3-step cycle: probabilistic prediction, structure extraction, and integration, enabling improved video modeling and state-of-the-art computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create richly controllable and flexibly promptable world models that can extract meaningful structures from data and use them for improved prediction and understanding.

Method: Three-step cycle: 1) Build probabilistic graphical model (Psi) as random-access autoregressive sequence model, 2) Extract low-dimensional structures via causal inference, 3) Integrate structures as new token types for continual training.

Result: Trained on 1.4T video tokens; achieved state-of-the-art optical flow, self-supervised depth, object segmentation; enabled useful video prediction and understanding inferences; supported full cycle of predictive improvements.

Conclusion: PSI successfully creates universal prompting-like capabilities for world models, demonstrating that iterative structure integration enhances both modeling performance and control capabilities.

Abstract: We present Probabilistic Structure Integration (PSI), a system for learning
richly controllable and flexibly promptable world models from data. PSI
consists of a three-step cycle. The first step, Probabilistic prediction,
involves building a probabilistic graphical model Psi of the data, in the form
of a random-access autoregressive sequence model. Psi supports a complete set
of learned conditional distributions describing the dependence of any variables
in the data on any other set of variables. In step 2, Structure extraction, we
show how to extract underlying low-dimensional properties in the data,
corresponding to a diverse set of meaningful "intermediate structures", in a
zero-shot fashion via causal inference on Psi. Step 3, Integration, completes
the cycle by converting these structures into new token types that are then
continually mixed back into the training diet as conditioning signals and
prediction targets. Each such cycle augments the capabilities of Psi, both
allowing it to model the underlying data better, and creating new control
handles -- akin to an LLM-like universal prompting language. We train an
instance of Psi on 1.4 trillion tokens of internet video data; we use it to
perform a variety of useful video prediction and understanding inferences; we
extract state-of-the-art optical flow, self-supervised depth and object
segmentation; and we use these structures to support a full cycle of predictive
improvements.

### [7] [Images in Motion?: A First Look into Video Leakage in Collaborative Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09742)
*Md Fazle Rasul,Alanood Alqobaisi,Bruhadeshwar Bezawada,Indrakshi Ray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First analysis of video data leakage in federated learning via gradient inversion attacks, showing feature extractors provide some protection but leakage is still possible, with super-resolution techniques enhancing attack effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While gradient inversion attacks are known to threaten privacy in federated learning for images, text, and tabular data, their impact on video data remains unexplored despite video's sensitive nature and growing use in privacy-critical applications.

Method: Evaluated two video classification approaches: one using pre-trained feature extractors and another processing raw video frames with simple transformations. Tested gradient inversion attacks across scenarios with zero, one, or multiple reference frames, and applied image super-resolution techniques to enhance reconstructed videos.

Result: Feature extractors offer greater resilience against attacks but leakage is still possible when classifiers lack sufficient complexity. Super-resolution techniques significantly improve the quality of reconstructed videos from gradient inversion attacks.

Conclusion: Video data leakage in federated learning is a viable threat that warrants further investigation, as current protection methods are insufficient against determined attackers using advanced reconstruction techniques.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple entities to train a shared model
collaboratively. Its core, privacy-preserving principle is that participants
only exchange model updates, such as gradients, and never their raw, sensitive
data. This approach is fundamental for applications in domains where privacy
and confidentiality are important. However, the security of this very mechanism
is threatened by gradient inversion attacks, which can reverse-engineer private
training data directly from the shared gradients, defeating the purpose of FL.
While the impact of these attacks is known for image, text, and tabular data,
their effect on video data remains an unexamined area of research. This paper
presents the first analysis of video data leakage in FL using gradient
inversion attacks. We evaluate two common video classification approaches: one
employing pre-trained feature extractors and another that processes raw video
frames with simple transformations. Our initial results indicate that the use
of feature extractors offers greater resilience against gradient inversion
attacks. We also demonstrate that image super-resolution techniques can enhance
the frames extracted through gradient inversion attacks, enabling attackers to
reconstruct higher-quality videos. Our experiments validate this across
scenarios where the attacker has access to zero, one, or more reference frames
from the target environment. We find that although feature extractors make
attacks more challenging, leakage is still possible if the classifier lacks
sufficient complexity. We, therefore, conclude that video data leakage in FL is
a viable threat, and the conditions under which it occurs warrant further
investigation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is scalable and practical for real-world retail applications including automated inventory tracking, product monitoring, and checkout systems, offering cost-effective and robust object detection solutions.

Abstract: This study proposes a semi-supervised co-training framework for object
detection in densely packed retail environments, where limited labeled data and
complex conditions pose major challenges. The framework combines Faster R-CNN
(utilizing a ResNet backbone) for precise localization with YOLO (employing a
Darknet backbone) for global context, enabling mutual pseudo-label exchange
that improves accuracy in scenes with occlusion and overlapping objects. To
strengthen classification, it employs an ensemble of XGBoost, Random Forest,
and SVM, utilizing diverse feature representations for higher robustness.
Hyperparameters are optimized using a metaheuristic-driven algorithm, enhancing
precision and efficiency across models. By minimizing reliance on manual
labeling, the approach reduces annotation costs and adapts effectively to
frequent product and layout changes common in retail. Experiments on the
SKU-110k dataset demonstrate strong performance, highlighting the scalability
and practicality of the proposed framework for real-world retail applications
such as automated inventory tracking, product monitoring, and checkout systems.

*Moslem Yazdanpanah,Ali Bahri,Mehrdad Noori,Sahar Dastani,Gustavo Adolfo Vargas Hakim,David Osowiechi,Ismail Ben Ayed,Christian Desrosiers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Token Purging (PG) is a novel backpropagation-free test-time adaptation method for 3D point cloud classification that removes domain-shift-affected tokens before attention layers, achieving superior performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance degradation caused by distribution shifts in 3D point cloud classification without requiring iterative updates or backpropagation during test-time adaptation.

Method: Two variants: PG-SP (uses source statistics) and PG-SF (fully source-free using CLS-token-driven adaptation). Both remove tokens highly affected by domain shifts before they reach attention layers.

Result: PG-SP achieves +10.3% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art backpropagation-free methods. PG-SF sets new benchmarks for source-free adaptation. PG is 12.4x faster and 5.5x more memory efficient than baseline.

Conclusion: Token Purging provides an efficient and effective solution for test-time adaptation in 3D point cloud classification, offering superior performance while being significantly faster and more memory-efficient than existing approaches.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) is crucial for mitigating performance degradation
caused by distribution shifts in 3D point cloud classification. In this work,
we introduce Token Purging (PG), a novel backpropagation-free approach that
removes tokens highly affected by domain shifts before they reach attention
layers. Unlike existing TTA methods, PG operates at the token level, ensuring
robust adaptation without iterative updates. We propose two variants: PG-SP,
which leverages source statistics, and PG-SF, a fully source-free version
relying on CLS-token-driven adaptation. Extensive evaluations on ModelNet40-C,
ShapeNet-C, and ScanObjectNN-C demonstrate that PG-SP achieves an average of
+10.3\% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art backpropagation-free methods,
while PG-SF sets new benchmarks for source-free adaptation. Moreover, PG is
12.4 times faster and 5.5 times more memory efficient than our baseline, making
it suitable for real-world deployment. Code is available at

### [10] [Fine-Grained Cross-View Localization via Local Feature Matching and Monocular Depth Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09792)
*Zimin Xia,Chenghao Xu,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel cross-view localization method that directly matches ground-to-aerial image features using depth priors, supporting both metric and relative depth with scale-aware alignment for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods transform ground images to bird's-eye view, causing information loss from perspective distortion and height compression, which degrades alignment quality with aerial images.

Method: Directly establishes correspondences between ground and aerial images, lifts matched keypoints to BEV space using monocular depth prior, and uses scale-aware Procrustes alignment for pose estimation with optional scale recovery for relative depth.

Result: Achieves superior localization performance under challenging conditions (cross-area generalization, unknown orientation), learns accurate local feature correspondences with only weak pose supervision, and works with various relative depth models without per-model finetuning.

Conclusion: The method provides accurate, interpretable cross-view localization with flexibility for real-world deployment, overcoming limitations of traditional BEV transformation approaches.

Abstract: We propose an accurate and highly interpretable fine-grained cross-view
localization method that estimates the 3 Degrees of Freedom pose of a
ground-level image by matching its local features with a reference aerial
image. Previous methods typically transform the ground image into a bird's-eye
view (BEV) representation and then align it with the aerial image for
localization. However, this transformation often leads to information loss due
to perspective distortion or compression of height information, thereby
degrading alignment quality with the aerial view. In contrast, our method
directly establishes correspondences between ground and aerial images and lifts
only the matched keypoints to BEV space using monocular depth prior. Notably,
modern depth predictors can provide reliable metric depth when the test samples
are similar to the training data. When the depth distribution differs, they
still produce consistent relative depth, i.e., depth accurate up to an unknown
scale. Our method supports both metric and relative depth. It employs a
scale-aware Procrustes alignment to estimate the camera pose from the
correspondences and optionally recover the scale when using relative depth.
Experimental results demonstrate that, with only weak supervision on camera
pose, our method learns accurate local feature correspondences and achieves
superior localization performance under challenging conditions, such as
cross-area generalization and unknown orientation. Moreover, our method is
compatible with various relative depth models without requiring per-model
finetuning. This flexibility, combined with strong localization performance,
makes it well-suited for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: KidsVisionCheck is a free mobile app that uses AI and smartphone cameras to perform pediatric vision screening via red-eye reflex analysis, achieving 90% accuracy without specialist equipment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make pediatric vision screening more accessible worldwide by recreating the clinical Bruckner test using smartphones and AI, enabling early detection of visual impairments in children.

Method: Deep neural networks trained on ophthalmologist-labeled red-eye reflex images from children's pupils, with data collection optimized for mobile device usage.

Result: 90% accuracy on unseen test data, providing highly reliable vision screening performance without requiring specialist clinical equipment.

Conclusion: This represents a significant first step toward accessible pediatric vision screenings and early intervention for vision abnormalities globally using mobile technology.

Abstract: Numerous visual impairments can be detected in red-eye reflex images from
young children. The so-called Bruckner test is traditionally performed by
ophthalmologists in clinical settings. Thanks to the recent technological
advances in smartphones and artificial intelligence, it is now possible to
recreate the Bruckner test using a mobile device. In this paper, we present a
first study conducted during the development of KidsVisionCheck, a free
application that can perform vision screening with a mobile device using
red-eye reflex images. The underlying model relies on deep neural networks
trained on children's pupil images collected and labeled by an ophthalmologist.
With an accuracy of 90% on unseen test data, our model provides highly reliable
performance without the necessity of specialist equipment. Furthermore, we can
identify the optimal conditions for data collection, which can in turn be used
to provide immediate feedback to the users. In summary, this work marks a first
step toward accessible pediatric vision screenings and early intervention for
vision abnormalities worldwide.

*Tim Broedermannn,Christos Sakaridis,Luigi Piccinelli,Wim Abbeloos,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DGFusion is a depth-guided multimodal fusion method for semantic perception in autonomous vehicles that uses depth information to dynamically adapt sensor fusion based on spatially varying sensor reliability across scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sensor fusion approaches treat sensor data uniformly across spatial input, which limits performance in challenging conditions. Depth information can help condition fusion based on spatially varying sensor reliability.

Method: Proposes DGFusion network that treats multimodal segmentation as multi-task problem, using lidar measurements as input and ground truth for depth learning. Includes auxiliary depth head to learn depth-aware features encoded into local depth tokens that condition attentive cross-modal fusion with a global condition token.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art panoptic and semantic segmentation performance on challenging MUSES and DELIVER datasets.

Conclusion: Depth-guided fusion with spatially varying local depth tokens and robust depth loss effectively adapts sensor fusion to varying sensor reliability across scenes, improving semantic perception performance.

Abstract: Robust semantic perception for autonomous vehicles relies on effectively
combining multiple sensors with complementary strengths and weaknesses.
State-of-the-art sensor fusion approaches to semantic perception often treat
sensor data uniformly across the spatial extent of the input, which hinders
performance when faced with challenging conditions. By contrast, we propose a
novel depth-guided multimodal fusion method that upgrades condition-aware
fusion by integrating depth information. Our network, DGFusion, poses
multimodal segmentation as a multi-task problem, utilizing the lidar
measurements, which are typically available in outdoor sensor suites, both as
one of the model's inputs and as ground truth for learning depth. Our
corresponding auxiliary depth head helps to learn depth-aware features, which
are encoded into spatially varying local depth tokens that condition our
attentive cross-modal fusion. Together with a global condition token, these
local depth tokens dynamically adapt sensor fusion to the spatially varying
reliability of each sensor across the scene, which largely depends on depth. In
addition, we propose a robust loss for our depth, which is essential for
learning from lidar inputs that are typically sparse and noisy in adverse
conditions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art panoptic and semantic
segmentation performance on the challenging MUSES and DELIVER datasets. Code

### [13] [Patch-based Automatic Rosacea Detection Using the ResNet Deep Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09841)
*Chengyu Yang,Rishik Reddy Yesgari,Chengjun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patch-based rosacea detection using ResNet-18 achieves competitive accuracy while preserving patient privacy by focusing on localized skin patches instead of full facial images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rosacea requires early detection for effective treatment, and current methods using full facial images may compromise patient privacy while not optimally focusing on clinically relevant regions.

Method: Proposed patch-based strategies using ResNet-18 framework with various image patches extracted from facial images in different sizes, shapes, and locations. Investigated how localized visual information influences model performance.

Result: Patch-based strategies achieved competitive or superior accuracy and sensitivity compared to full-image methods. The approach guides the model to focus on clinically relevant regions, enhances robustness and interpretability, and protects patient privacy.

Conclusion: Patch-based automatic rosacea detection offers practical insights for improving automated dermatological diagnostics by balancing accuracy with privacy preservation and clinical relevance.

Abstract: Rosacea, which is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that manifests with
facial redness, papules, and visible blood vessels, often requirs precise and
early detection for significantly improving treatment effectiveness. This paper
presents new patch-based automatic rosacea detection strategies using the
ResNet-18 deep learning framework. The contributions of the proposed strategies
come from the following aspects. First, various image pateches are extracted
from the facial images of people in different sizes, shapes, and locations.
Second, a number of investigation studies are carried out to evaluate how the
localized visual information influences the deep learing model performance.
Third, thorough experiments are implemented to reveal that several patch-based
automatic rosacea detection strategies achieve competitive or superior accuracy
and sensitivity than the full-image based methods. And finally, the proposed
patch-based strategies, which use only localized patches, inherently preserve
patient privacy by excluding any identifiable facial features from the data.
The experimental results indicate that the proposed patch-based strategies
guide the deep learning model to focus on clinically relevant regions, enhance
robustness and interpretability, and protect patient privacy. As a result, the
proposed strategies offer practical insights for improving automated
dermatological diagnostics.

*Chengyu Yang,Rishik Reddy Yesgari,Chengjun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Privacy-preserving rosacea detection using synthetic data and clinical priors with a redness-informed mask to focus on diagnostically relevant facial areas while excluding identity-revealing features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rosacea is underdiagnosed and automated detection faces challenges due to diffuse symptoms, scarce labeled datasets, and privacy concerns with identifiable facial images.

Method: Constructs a fixed redness-informed mask to focus on central facial erythema regions (cheeks, nose, forehead), then trains ResNet-18 on masked synthetic images.

Result: Achieves superior performance over full-face baselines with notable gains in accuracy, recall and F1 score on real-world test data.

Conclusion: Synthetic data combined with clinical priors enables accurate and ethical dermatological AI systems for privacy-sensitive telemedicine and large-scale screening applications.

Abstract: Rosacea is a common but underdiagnosed inflammatory skin condition that
primarily affects the central face and presents with subtle redness, pustules,
and visible blood vessels. Automated detection remains challenging due to the
diffuse nature of symptoms, the scarcity of labeled datasets, and privacy
concerns associated with using identifiable facial images. A novel
privacy-preserving automated rosacea detection method inspired by clinical
priors and trained entirely on synthetic data is presented in this paper.
Specifically, the proposed method, which leverages the observation that rosacea
manifests predominantly through central facial erythema, first constructs a
fixed redness-informed mask by selecting regions with consistently high red
channel intensity across facial images. The mask thus is able to focus on
diagnostically relevant areas such as the cheeks, nose, and forehead and
exclude identity-revealing features. Second, the ResNet-18 deep learning
method, which is trained on the masked synthetic images, achieves superior
performance over the full-face baselines with notable gains in terms of

Conclusion: The study provides comprehensive analysis of component contributions to ULW framework performance, establishing the necessity and effectiveness of each element in laparoscopic image desmoking.

Abstract: To rigorously assess the effectiveness and necessity of individual components
within the recently proposed ULW framework for laparoscopic image desmoking,
this paper presents a comprehensive ablation study. The ULW approach combines a
U-Net based backbone with a compound loss function that comprises mean squared
error (MSE), structural similarity index (SSIM) loss, and perceptual loss. The
framework also incorporates a differentiable, learnable Wiener filter module.
In this study, each component is systematically ablated to evaluate its
specific contribution to the overall performance of the whole framework. The
analysis includes: (1) removal of the learnable Wiener filter, (2) selective
use of individual loss terms from the composite loss function. All variants are
benchmarked on a publicly available paired laparoscopic images dataset using
quantitative metrics (SSIM, PSNR, MSE and CIEDE-2000) alongside qualitative
visual comparisons.

TL;DR: WAVE-DETR is a multi-modal drone detector that fuses RGB visual and acoustic signals using Deformable DETR and Wav2Vec2 architectures, achieving significant performance improvements across all drone sizes in challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust UAV detection system that works effectively under challenging environmental conditions by leveraging both visual and acoustic information, overcoming limitations of single-modal approaches.

Method: Combines Deformable DETR for visual processing with Wav2Vec2 for acoustic feature extraction. Tests four fusion configurations: gated mechanism, linear layer, MLP, and cross attention to integrate acoustic embeddings with multi-resolution visual features.

Result: Gated fusion approach performed best, improving mAP by 11.1-15.3% for small drones and 3.27-5.84% overall across all drone sizes. Used Drone-vs-Bird dataset and new ARDrone dataset with 7,500+ synchronized image-audio segments.

Conclusion: Acoustic information significantly enhances drone detection performance, particularly for small drones. Multi-modal fusion proves effective for robust UAV detection in real-world scenarios across various environmental conditions.

Abstract: We introduce a multi-modal WAVE-DETR drone detector combining visible RGB and
acoustic signals for robust real-life UAV object detection. Our approach fuses
visual and acoustic features in a unified object detector model relying on the
Deformable DETR and Wav2Vec2 architectures, achieving strong performance under
challenging environmental conditions. Our work leverage the existing
Drone-vs-Bird dataset and the newly generated ARDrone dataset containing more
than 7,500 synchronized images and audio segments. We show how the acoustic
information is used to improve the performance of the Deformable DETR object
detector on the real ARDrone dataset. We developed, trained and tested four
different fusion configurations based on a gated mechanism, linear layer, MLP
and cross attention. The Wav2Vec2 acoustic embeddings are fused with the multi
resolution feature mappings of the Deformable DETR and enhance the object
detection performance over all drones dimensions. The best performer is the
gated fusion approach, which improves the mAP of the Deformable DETR object
detector on our in-distribution and out-of-distribution ARDrone datasets by
11.1% to 15.3% for small drones across all IoU thresholds between 0.5 and 0.9.
The mAP scores for medium and large drones are also enhanced, with overall
gains across all drone sizes ranging from 3.27% to 5.84%.

TL;DR: Surrogate supervision improves robustness of deep learning image registration by decoupling input and supervision domains, allowing training on heterogeneous data while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning-based deformable image registration is sensitive to variations in input characteristics like artifacts, field-of-view mismatch, and modality differences, limiting generalizability.

Method: Introduces surrogate supervision that applies estimated spatial transformations to surrogate images, separating input domain from supervision domain to enable training on heterogeneous inputs.

Result: Offers practical pathway to more robust medical image registration, enabling broader applicability in diverse biomedical imaging scenarios.

Conclusion: Surrogate supervision provides a principled framework for training robust and generalizable deep registration models without increasing complexity.

Abstract: Objective: Deep learning-based deformable image registration has achieved
strong accuracy, but remains sensitive to variations in input image
characteristics such as artifacts, field-of-view mismatch, or modality
difference. We aim to develop a general training paradigm that improves the
robustness and generalizability of registration networks. Methods: We introduce
surrogate supervision, which decouples the input domain from the supervision
domain by applying estimated spatial transformations to surrogate images. This
allows training on heterogeneous inputs while ensuring supervision is computed
in domains where similarity is well defined. We evaluate the framework through
three representative applications: artifact-robust brain MR registration,
mask-agnostic lung CT registration, and multi-modal MR registration. Results:
Across tasks, surrogate supervision demonstrated strong resilience to input
variations including inhomogeneity field, inconsistent field-of-view, and
modality differences, while maintaining high performance on well-curated data.
Conclusions: Surrogate supervision provides a principled framework for training
robust and generalizable deep learning-based registration models without
increasing complexity. Significance: Surrogate supervision offers a practical
pathway to more robust and generalizable medical image registration, enabling
broader applicability in diverse biomedical imaging scenarios.

*Barkin Buyukcakir,Jannick De Tobel,Patrick Thevissen,Dirk Vandermeulen,Peter Claes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework combining convolutional autoencoder and Vision Transformer improves dental age estimation accuracy and provides diagnostic insights, revealing data-centric limitations in tooth morphology variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the 'black box' nature of deep learning models in high-stakes forensic applications like dental age estimation, and to enhance both performance and transparency.

Method: Proposes a framework combining convolutional autoencoder (AE) with Vision Transformer (ViT) for automated staging of mandibular second and third molars, using latent space analysis and image reconstructions for diagnostic insights.

Result: Improved classification accuracy from 0.712 to 0.815 for tooth 37 and from 0.462 to 0.543 for tooth 38 over baseline ViT. Analysis revealed performance gap is data-centric due to high intra-class morphological variability in tooth 38 dataset.

Conclusion: The framework provides both enhanced accuracy and evidence for model uncertainty, serving as a more robust tool for forensic age estimation. Highlights insufficiency of single interpretability modes like attention maps and emphasizes need for multi-faceted diagnostic approaches.

Abstract: The practical adoption of deep learning in high-stakes forensic applications,
such as dental age estimation, is often limited by the 'black box' nature of
the models. This study introduces a framework designed to enhance both
performance and transparency in this context. We use a notable performance
disparity in the automated staging of mandibular second (tooth 37) and third
(tooth 38) molars as a case study. The proposed framework, which combines a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) with a Vision Transformer (ViT), improves
classification accuracy for both teeth over a baseline ViT, increasing from
0.712 to 0.815 for tooth 37 and from 0.462 to 0.543 for tooth 38. Beyond
improving performance, the framework provides multi-faceted diagnostic
insights. Analysis of the AE's latent space metrics and image reconstructions
indicates that the remaining performance gap is data-centric, suggesting high
intra-class morphological variability in the tooth 38 dataset is a primary
limiting factor. This work highlights the insufficiency of relying on a single
mode of interpretability, such as attention maps, which can appear anatomically
plausible yet fail to identify underlying data issues. By offering a
methodology that both enhances accuracy and provides evidence for why a model
may be uncertain, this framework serves as a more robust tool to support expert
decision-making in forensic age estimation.

### [19] [SCoDA: Self-supervised Continual Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09935)
*Chirayu Agrawal,Snehasis Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCoDA introduces self-supervised learning and geometric manifold alignment for source-free domain adaptation, outperforming existing methods by preserving crucial geometric information and avoiding supervised pre-training dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFDA methods discard important geometric information about the latent manifold when using cosine similarity over L2-normalized features, and rely on supervised pre-training which limits their effectiveness.

Method: Uses self-supervised pre-trained teacher model, geometric manifold alignment principle, composite objective with instance-level feature matching and Space Similarity Loss, and EMA updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Extensive experiments show SCoDA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SCoDA successfully addresses limitations of previous SFDA approaches by leveraging self-supervised learning and geometric manifold alignment, achieving superior performance without supervised pre-training.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) addresses the challenge of adapting a
model to a target domain without access to the data of the source domain.
Prevailing methods typically start with a source model pre-trained with full
supervision and distill the knowledge by aligning instance-level features.
However, these approaches, relying on cosine similarity over L2-normalized
feature vectors, inadvertently discard crucial geometric information about the
latent manifold of the source model. We introduce Self-supervised Continual
Domain Adaptation (SCoDA) to address these limitations. We make two key
departures from standard practice: first, we avoid the reliance on supervised
pre-training by initializing the proposed framework with a teacher model
pre-trained entirely via self-supervision (SSL). Second, we adapt the principle
of geometric manifold alignment to the SFDA setting. The student is trained
with a composite objective combining instance-level feature matching with a
Space Similarity Loss. To combat catastrophic forgetting, the teacher's
parameters are updated via an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the student's
parameters. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCoDA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods.

### [20] [Segment Anything for Cell Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09943)
*Zhu Chen,Mert Edgü,Er Jin,Johannes Stegmaier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot cell tracking framework using SAM2 foundation model for unsupervised microscopy image analysis without manual labeling or dataset-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods require costly manual labeling and lack generalizability across diverse microscopy datasets due to their dependence on specific training data.

Method: Integrate Segment Anything 2 (SAM2) foundation model into tracking pipeline as a fully-unsupervised approach that doesn't require training or fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy in both 2D and large-scale 3D time-lapse microscopy videos without dataset-specific adaptation.

Conclusion: Proposed zero-shot framework overcomes limitations of manual labeling and poor generalization, enabling effective cell tracking across diverse microscopy datasets.

Abstract: Tracking cells and detecting mitotic events in time-lapse microscopy image
sequences is a crucial task in biomedical research. However, it remains highly
challenging due to dividing objects, low signal-tonoise ratios, indistinct
boundaries, dense clusters, and the visually similar appearance of individual
cells. Existing deep learning-based methods rely on manually labeled datasets
for training, which is both costly and time-consuming. Moreover, their
generalizability to unseen datasets remains limited due to the vast diversity
of microscopy data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a zero-shot cell
tracking framework by integrating Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), a large foundation
model designed for general image and video segmentation, into the tracking
pipeline. As a fully-unsupervised approach, our method does not depend on or
inherit biases from any specific training dataset, allowing it to generalize
across diverse microscopy datasets without finetuning. Our approach achieves
competitive accuracy in both 2D and large-scale 3D time-lapse microscopy videos
while eliminating the need for dataset-specific adaptation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to extend existing 2D multi-camera tracking systems into 3D space using depth information and point-cloud reconstruction, achieving 3rd place in the 2025 AI City Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MTMC systems operate in 2D space, but 3D tracking requires rebuilding all components from scratch, which is impractical for existing systems. The paper aims to provide a way to upgrade 2D systems to 3D without complete overhaul.

Method: Utilizes depth information to reconstruct targets in point-cloud space, applies clustering and yaw refinement for 3D box recovery, and introduces enhanced online data association using local ID consistency for global ID assignment across frames.

Result: The framework was evaluated on the 2025 AI City Challenge's 3D MTMC dataset and achieved 3rd place on the leaderboard, demonstrating effective performance.

Conclusion: The approach successfully extends 2D multi-camera tracking systems into 3D space without requiring complete system replacement, providing a practical solution for upgrading existing surveillance infrastructure with 3D perception capabilities.

Abstract: Multi-Target Multi-Camera Tracking (MTMC) is an essential computer vision
task for automating large-scale surveillance. With camera calibration and depth
information, the targets in the scene can be projected into 3D space, offering
unparalleled levels of automatic perception of a 3D environment. However,
tracking in the 3D space requires replacing all 2D tracking components from the
ground up, which may be infeasible for existing MTMC systems. In this paper, we
present an approach for extending any online 2D multi-camera tracking system
into 3D space by utilizing depth information to reconstruct a target in
point-cloud space, and recovering its 3D box through clustering and yaw
refinement following tracking. We also introduced an enhanced online data
association mechanism that leverages the target's local ID consistency to
assign global IDs across frames. The proposed framework is evaluated on the
2025 AI City Challenge's 3D MTMC dataset, achieving 3rd place on the
leaderboard.

*Jeffrey Liu,Rongbin Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot workflow using visual-language verification with generic object detection and VLMs achieves state-of-the-art REC performance without task-specific training, outperforming trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) can be effectively solved without task-specific training by leveraging general-purpose vision-language models and proper workflow design.

Method: Reformulates REC as box-wise visual-language verification: uses COCO-clean YOLO-World detector for proposals, then a general-purpose VLM answers True/False queries for each region independently without fine-tuning.

Result: Surpasses zero-shot GroundingDINO baseline and exceeds reported results for trained GroundingDINO and GroundingDINO+CRG on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg datasets. Verification significantly outperforms selection-based prompting.

Conclusion: Workflow design, rather than task-specific pretraining, drives strong zero-shot REC performance, enabling competitive results without REC-specific training while supporting abstention and multiple matches.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is usually addressed with
task-trained grounding models. We show that a zero-shot workflow, without any
REC-specific training, can achieve competitive or superior performance. Our
approach reformulates REC as box-wise visual-language verification: given
proposals from a COCO-clean generic detector (YOLO-World), a general-purpose
VLM independently answers True/False queries for each region. This simple
procedure reduces cross-box interference, supports abstention and multiple
matches, and requires no fine-tuning. On RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, our
method not only surpasses a zero-shot GroundingDINO baseline but also exceeds
reported results for GroundingDINO trained on REC and GroundingDINO+CRG.
Controlled studies with identical proposals confirm that verification
significantly outperforms selection-based prompting, and results hold with open
VLMs. Overall, we show that workflow design, rather than task-specific
pretraining, drives strong zero-shot REC performance.

*Tianqi Wei,Xin Yu,Zhi Chen,Scott Chapman,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Random Projected Copy-and-Paste (RPCP) augmentation to address extreme pixel imbalance in wheat disease segmentation, particularly for rare insect damage classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme pixel-level imbalance in wheat disease segmentation causes overfitting to common classes and insufficient learning of rare insect damage classes, impairing overall segmentation performance.

Method: Extracts rare insect-damage patches, applies random geometric transformations, pastes them in appropriate regions avoiding overlaps, and uses random projection filters to refine features and ensure natural blending with background.

Result: Substantially improves segmentation performance on insect damage class while maintaining or slightly enhancing accuracy on other categories.

Conclusion: Targeted augmentation effectively mitigates extreme pixel imbalance, providing a straightforward yet effective solution for agricultural segmentation problems.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of foliar diseases and insect damage in wheat is
crucial for effective crop management and disease control. However, the insect
damage typically occupies only a tiny fraction of annotated pixels. This
extreme pixel-level imbalance poses a significant challenge to the segmentation
performance, which can result in overfitting to common classes and insufficient
learning of rare classes, thereby impairing overall performance. In this paper,
we propose a Random Projected Copy-and-Paste (RPCP) augmentation technique to
address the pixel imbalance problem. Specifically, we extract rare
insect-damage patches from annotated training images and apply random geometric
transformations to simulate variations. The transformed patches are then pasted
in appropriate regions while avoiding overlaps with lesions or existing damaged
regions. In addition, we apply a random projection filter to the pasted
regions, refining local features and ensuring a natural blend with the new
background. Experiments show that our method substantially improves
segmentation performance on the insect damage class, while maintaining or even
slightly enhancing accuracy on other categories. Our results highlight the
effectiveness of targeted augmentation in mitigating extreme pixel imbalance,
offering a straightforward yet effective solution for agricultural segmentation
problems.

### [24] [An HMM-based framework for identity-aware long-term multi-object tracking from sparse and uncertain identification: use case on long-term tracking in livestock](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09962)
*Anne Marthe Sophie Ngo Bibinbe,Chiron Bang,Patrick Gagnon,Jamie Ahloy-Dallaire,Eric R. Paquet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new HMM framework that combines uncertain identities with tracking to improve long-term multi-object tracking performance, particularly for applications like livestock monitoring where sporadic identifications are available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MOT approaches suffer from identity switches over time, making them unsuitable for long-term tracking. Real-world applications like livestock monitoring can provide sporadic identifications (e.g., from feeders), which can help maintain identity consistency.

Method: Proposes a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework that integrates uncertain identities with tracking. The approach combines tracking data with sporadic identity information to improve long-term tracking performance.

Result: The HMM framework improves ByteTrack's F1 score on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset with 21 identifications. It shows robustness to identification uncertainty and performance increases with more frequent identity updates. Also validated on MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks with both ByteTrack and FairMOT.

Conclusion: The proposed HMM framework effectively addresses long-term MOT challenges by leveraging sporadic identifications, demonstrating improved performance and robustness across multiple datasets and tracking methods.

Abstract: The need for long-term multi-object tracking (MOT) is growing due to the
demand for analyzing individual behaviors in videos that span several minutes.
Unfortunately, due to identity switches between objects, the tracking
performance of existing MOT approaches decreases over time, making them
difficult to apply for long-term tracking. However, in many real-world
applications, such as in the livestock sector, it is possible to obtain
sporadic identifications for some of the animals from sources like feeders. To
address the challenges of long-term MOT, we propose a new framework that
combines both uncertain identities and tracking using a Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) formulation. In addition to providing real-world identities to animals,
our HMM framework improves the F1 score of ByteTrack, a leading MOT approach
even with re-identification, on a 10 minute pig tracking dataset with 21
identifications at the pen's feeding station. We also show that our approach is
robust to the uncertainty of identifications, with performance increasing as
identities are provided more frequently. The improved performance of our HMM
framework was also validated on the MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark datasets using
both ByteTrack and FairMOT. The code for this new HMM framework and the new
10-minute pig tracking video dataset are available at:

Motivation: Event cameras offer low latency, low power, and high capture rates but need fusion with traditional frame capture to maximize benefits for video restoration and 3D reconstruction tasks.

Method: Systematic review of deep learning contributions to image/video enhancement, focusing on temporal enhancement (frame interpolation, motion deblurring) and spatial enhancement (super-resolution, low-light/HDR enhancement, artifact reduction).

Result: Comprehensive survey of event-stream fusion techniques that significantly benefit various video restoration tasks and 3D reconstruction, with compilation of open datasets for reproducible research.

Conclusion: The survey consolidates recent progress to inspire further research into leveraging event camera systems combined with deep learning for advanced visual media restoration and enhancement.

Abstract: Event camera sensors are bio-inspired sensors which asynchronously capture
per-pixel brightness changes and output a stream of events encoding the
polarity, location and time of these changes. These systems are witnessing
rapid advancements as an emerging field, driven by their low latency, reduced
power consumption, and ultra-high capture rates. This survey explores the
evolution of fusing event-stream captured with traditional frame-based capture,
highlighting how this synergy significantly benefits various video restoration
and 3D reconstruction tasks. The paper systematically reviews major deep
learning contributions to image/video enhancement and restoration, focusing on
two dimensions: temporal enhancement (such as frame interpolation and motion
deblurring) and spatial enhancement (including super-resolution, low-light and
HDR enhancement, and artifact reduction). This paper also explores how the 3D
reconstruction domain evolves with the advancement of event driven fusion.
Diverse topics are covered, with in-depth discussions on recent works for
improving visual quality under challenging conditions. Additionally, the survey
compiles a comprehensive list of openly available datasets, enabling
reproducible research and benchmarking. By consolidating recent progress and
insights, this survey aims to inspire further research into leveraging event

TL;DR: ISTASTrack is a transformer-based ANN-SNN hybrid tracker that uses ISTA adapters to effectively fuse RGB and event data for improved visual object tracking performance and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ANN-based RGB-Event tracking methods struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event streams, and hybrid ANN-SNN architectures face challenges in effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms.

Method: Two-branch model with vision transformer for RGB inputs and spiking transformer for event streams, plus ISTA adapters derived from sparse representation theory for bidirectional feature interaction and temporal downsampling attention module for temporal fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on RGB-Event tracking benchmarks (FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, FELT) while maintaining high energy efficiency.

Conclusion: ISTASTrack demonstrates the effectiveness and practicality of hybrid ANN-SNN designs for robust visual tracking, successfully bridging modality and paradigm gaps between ANN and SNN features.

Abstract: RGB-Event tracking has become a promising trend in visual object tracking to
leverage the complementary strengths of both RGB images and dynamic spike
events for improved performance. However, existing artificial neural networks
(ANNs) struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event
streams. Recent efforts toward hybrid architectures combining ANNs and spiking
neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution in RGB-Event
perception, yet effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose ISTASTrack, the first
transformer-based \textbf{A}NN-\textbf{S}NN hybrid \textbf{Track}er equipped
with \textbf{ISTA} adapters for RGB-Event tracking. The two-branch model
employs a vision transformer to extract spatial context from RGB inputs and a
spiking transformer to capture spatio-temporal dynamics from event streams. To
bridge the modality and paradigm gap between ANN and SNN features, we
systematically design a model-based ISTA adapter for bidirectional feature
interaction between the two branches, derived from sparse representation theory
by unfolding the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. Additionally, we
incorporate a temporal downsampling attention module within the adapter to
align multi-step SNN features with single-step ANN features in the latent
space, improving temporal fusion. Experimental results on RGB-Event tracking
benchmarks, such as FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, and FELT, have demonstrated that
ISTASTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high energy
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of hybrid ANN-SNN
designs for robust visual tracking. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate solar flare prediction is crucial for infrastructure protection, but current methods perform poorly due to severe class imbalance across flare classes.

Method: Multiple deep state space models with frequency & local-boundary-aware reliability loss (FLARE loss) to address class imbalance issues.

Result: Outperformed baseline approaches in both Gandin-Murphy-Gerrity score and true skill statistic metrics on multi-wavelength solar image dataset covering 11-year solar cycle.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses class imbalance in solar flare prediction and demonstrates superior performance and reliability compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable solar flare predictions are essential to mitigate
potential impacts on critical infrastructure. However, the current performance
of solar flare forecasting is insufficient. In this study, we address the task
of predicting the class of the largest solar flare expected to occur within the
next 72 hours. Existing methods often fail to adequately address the severe
class imbalance across flare classes. To address this issue, we propose a solar
flare prediction model based on multiple deep state space models. In addition,
we introduce the frequency & local-boundary-aware reliability loss (FLARE loss)
to improve predictive performance and reliability under class imbalance.
Experiments were conducted on a multi-wavelength solar image dataset covering a
full 11-year solar activity cycle. As a result, our method outperformed
baseline approaches in terms of both the Gandin-Murphy-Gerrity score and the
true skill statistic, which are standard metrics in terms of the performance
and reliability.

TL;DR: TUNI is an efficient RGB-thermal semantic segmentation model that integrates feature extraction and fusion in a unified encoder, achieving competitive performance with fewer parameters and real-time inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-T models use separate encoders pre-trained on RGB images, leading to limited thermal feature extraction, suboptimal cross-modal fusion, and redundant architecture that compromises real-time efficiency.

Method: Proposes TUNI with a unified RGB-T encoder that simultaneously performs multi-modal feature extraction and fusion, using large-scale pre-training with RGB and pseudo-thermal data. Includes an RGB-T local module with adaptive cosine similarity to emphasize salient consistent and distinct local features across modalities.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models on FMB, PST900 and CART datasets, with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Achieves 27 FPS inference speed on Jetson Orin NX.

Conclusion: TUNI demonstrates that unified feature extraction and fusion in a single encoder architecture can achieve both high performance and real-time efficiency for RGB-T semantic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: RGB-thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation improves the environmental
perception of autonomous platforms in challenging conditions. Prevailing models
employ encoders pre-trained on RGB images to extract features from both RGB and
infrared inputs, and design additional modules to achieve cross-modal feature
fusion. This results in limited thermal feature extraction and suboptimal
cross-modal fusion, while the redundant encoders further compromises the
model's real-time efficiency. To address the above issues, we propose TUNI,
with an RGB-T encoder consisting of multiple stacked blocks that simultaneously
perform multi-modal feature extraction and cross-modal fusion. By leveraging
large-scale pre-training with RGB and pseudo-thermal data, the RGB-T encoder
learns to integrate feature extraction and fusion in a unified manner. By
slimming down the thermal branch, the encoder achieves a more compact
architecture. Moreover, we introduce an RGB-T local module to strengthen the
encoder's capacity for cross-modal local feature fusion. The RGB-T local module
employs adaptive cosine similarity to selectively emphasize salient consistent
and distinct local features across RGB-T modalities. Experimental results show
that TUNI achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models on FMB,
PST900 and CART, with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Meanwhile,
it achieves an inference speed of 27 FPS on a Jetson Orin NX, demonstrating its
real-time capability in deployment. Codes are available at

*Masaki Akiba,Shumpei Takezaki,Daichi Haraguchi,Seiichi Uchida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel few-part-shot font generation model that creates complete fonts using only partial design elements instead of full characters, improving efficiency and providing insights into how partial details influence overall character structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional few-shot font generation requires entire character shapes for multiple character classes, which can be inefficient. This approach aims to streamline font creation by using only partial design elements as input.

Method: The paper proposes a model that designs complete fonts based on a set of partial shapes (design elements) rather than requiring full character shapes for reference.

Result: The model successfully generates entire fonts using only partial input shapes, demonstrating improved efficiency in font creation compared to traditional few-shot methods.

Conclusion: This approach not only enhances the efficiency of font generation but also provides valuable insights into how partial design details contribute to and influence the overall structure of characters in a font.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel model of few-part-shot font generation, which
designs an entire font based on a set of partial design elements, i.e., partial
shapes. Unlike conventional few-shot font generation, which requires entire
character shapes for a couple of character classes, our approach only needs
partial shapes as input. The proposed model not only improves the efficiency of
font creation but also provides insights into how partial design details
influence the entire structure of the individual characters.

*Jonas Kühne,Christian Vogt,Michele Magno,Luca Benini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An optimized Visual Inertial Odometry pipeline for micro/nano-UAVs using quantized feature tracking methods (SuperPoint, PX4FLOW, ORB) on RISC-V SoCs, achieving 3.65x RMSE reduction and real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between high-accuracy VIO pipelines requiring powerful systems and lightweight implementations suitable for microcontrollers on resource-constrained micro/nano-UAVs.

Method: Developed an efficient VIO pipeline incorporating state-of-the-art feature detection/tracking methods (SuperPoint, PX4FLOW, ORB) optimized and quantized for RISC-V SoCs, using rigid body motion model to reduce estimation errors.

Result: Achieved average 3.65x reduction in RMSE over baseline using ORB tracker on GAP9 SoC. PX4FLOW showed on-par accuracy with ORB at lower runtime for speeds below 24 pixels/frame.

Conclusion: The pipeline successfully enables high-accuracy VIO on ultra-low-power systems, making it suitable for real-time applications on micro- and nano-UAVs with significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is a widely used computer vision method that
determines an agent's movement through a camera and an IMU sensor. This paper
presents an efficient and accurate VIO pipeline optimized for applications on
micro- and nano-UAVs. The proposed design incorporates state-of-the-art feature
detection and tracking methods (SuperPoint, PX4FLOW, ORB), all optimized and
quantized for emerging RISC-V-based ultra-low-power parallel systems on chips
(SoCs). Furthermore, by employing a rigid body motion model, the pipeline
reduces estimation errors and achieves improved accuracy in planar motion
scenarios. The pipeline's suitability for real-time VIO is assessed on an
ultra-low-power SoC in terms of compute requirements and tracking accuracy
after quantization. The pipeline, including the three feature tracking methods,
was implemented on the SoC for real-world validation. This design bridges the
gap between high-accuracy VIO pipelines that are traditionally run on
computationally powerful systems and lightweight implementations suitable for
microcontrollers. The optimized pipeline on the GAP9 low-power SoC demonstrates
an average reduction in RMSE of up to a factor of 3.65x over the baseline
pipeline when using the ORB feature tracker. The analysis of the computational
complexity of the feature trackers further shows that PX4FLOW achieves on-par
tracking accuracy with ORB at a lower runtime for movement speeds below 24
pixels/frame.

TL;DR: MLANet: Hierarchical multi-level attention network for 3D face reconstruction from single in-the-wild images using CNN and semi-supervised training with 3DMM parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in 3D face reconstruction from 2D images due to lack of ground-truth labeled datasets and complexity of real-world environments.

Method: Uses hierarchical backbone network with multi-level attention mechanisms, semi-supervised training with 3DMM parameters, and differentiable renderer for end-to-end training.

Result: Extensive experiments on AFLW2000-3D and MICC Florence datasets show effectiveness in 3D face reconstruction and alignment tasks, evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: Proposed MLANet effectively reconstructs detailed 3D face models from single in-the-wild images using attention mechanisms and semi-supervised learning.

Abstract: Recovering 3D face models from 2D in-the-wild images has gained considerable
attention in the computer vision community due to its wide range of potential
applications. However, the lack of ground-truth labeled datasets and the
complexity of real-world environments remain significant challenges. In this
chapter, we propose a convolutional neural network-based approach, the
Hierarchical Multi-Level Attention Network (MLANet), for reconstructing 3D face
models from single in-the-wild images. Our model predicts detailed facial
geometry, texture, pose, and illumination parameters from a single image.
Specifically, we employ a pre-trained hierarchical backbone network and
introduce multi-level attention mechanisms at different stages of 2D face image
feature extraction. A semi-supervised training strategy is employed,
incorporating 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) parameters from publicly available
datasets along with a differentiable renderer, enabling an end-to-end training
process. Extensive experiments, including both comparative and ablation
studies, were conducted on two benchmark datasets, AFLW2000-3D and MICC
Florence, focusing on 3D face reconstruction and 3D face alignment tasks. The
effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated both quantitatively and
qualitatively.

*Jing Huang,Zhiya Tan,Shutao Gong,Fanwei Zeng,Jianshu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaV-CoT is a novel Language-aware Visual Chain-of-Thought framework that enhances multilingual visual question answering through multi-stage reasoning and multi-aspect reward optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches rely primarily on textual CoT with limited support for multilingual multimodal reasoning, constraining real-world deployment. There's a need for better interpretable multilingual visual reasoning frameworks.

Method: Multi-stage reasoning pipeline (Text Summary with BBox, Language Identification, Spatial Object-level Captioning, Logical Reasoning) with automated data curation and two-stage training combining SFT with Language-aware GRPO using multi-aspect rewards.

Result: Achieves up to 9.5% accuracy improvements over open-source baselines, surpasses 2x larger models by 2.6%, and outperforms proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-flash. Validated through online A/B testing.

Conclusion: LaV-CoT provides an effective framework for multilingual visual reasoning with strong performance improvements and real-world applicability, making it suitable for industrial deployment.

Abstract: As large vision language models (VLMs) advance, their capabilities in
multilingual visual question answering (mVQA) have significantly improved.
Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been proven to enhance interpretability
and complex reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on
textual CoT and provide limited support for multilingual multimodal reasoning,
constraining their deployment in real-world applications. To address this gap,
we introduce \textbf{LaV-CoT}, the first Language-aware Visual CoT framework
with Multi-Aspect Reward Optimization. LaV-CoT incorporates an interpretable
multi-stage reasoning pipeline consisting of Text Summary with Bounding Box
(BBox), Language Identification, Spatial Object-level Captioning, and
Step-by-step Logical Reasoning. Following this reasoning pipeline, we design an
automated data curation method that generates multilingual CoT annotations
through iterative generation, correction, and refinement, enabling scalable and
high-quality training data. To improve reasoning and generalization, LaV-CoT
adopts a two-stage training paradigm combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
with Language-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by
verifiable multi-aspect rewards including language consistency, structural
accuracy, and semantic alignment. Extensive evaluations on public datasets
including MMMB, Multilingual MMBench, and MTVQA show that LaV-CoT achieves up
to \(\sim\)9.5\% accuracy improvements over open-source baselines of similar
size and even surpasses models with 2$\times$ larger scales by \(\sim\)2.6\%.
Moreover, LaV-CoT outperforms advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o-0513
and Gemini-2.5-flash. We further conducted an online A/B test to validate our
method on real-world data, highlighting its effectiveness for industrial
deployment. Our code is available at this link:

*Sung-Lin Tsai,Bo-Lun Huang,Yu Ting Shen,Cheng Yu Yeo,Chiang Tseng,Bo-Kai Ruan,Wen-Sheng Lien,Hong-Han Shuai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework that uses LLMs to disambiguate color terms and refines text embeddings in CIELAB space to improve color accuracy in text-to-image generation without compromising image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with nuanced and compound color terms (e.g., Tiffany blue, lime green), producing misaligned colors that don't match human intent, which is critical for applications like fashion and product design.

Method: Uses LLM to disambiguate color-related prompts, then refines text embeddings based on spatial relationships of color terms in CIELAB color space to guide color blending operations without additional training or reference images.

Result: Experimental results show improved color alignment without compromising image quality, effectively bridging the gap between text semantics and visual generation.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free framework successfully enhances color fidelity in T2I generation by systematically resolving ambiguous color descriptions through LLM disambiguation and CIELAB space refinement.

Abstract: Accurate color alignment in text-to-image (T2I) generation is critical for
applications such as fashion, product visualization, and interior design, yet
current diffusion models struggle with nuanced and compound color terms (e.g.,
Tiffany blue, lime green, hot pink), often producing images that are misaligned
with human intent. Existing approaches rely on cross-attention manipulation,
reference images, or fine-tuning but fail to systematically resolve ambiguous
color descriptions. To precisely render colors under prompt ambiguity, we
propose a training-free framework that enhances color fidelity by leveraging a
large language model (LLM) to disambiguate color-related prompts and guiding
color blending operations directly in the text embedding space. Our method
first employs a large language model (LLM) to resolve ambiguous color terms in
the text prompt, and then refines the text embeddings based on the spatial
relationships of the resulting color terms in the CIELAB color space. Unlike
prior methods, our approach improves color accuracy without requiring
additional training or external reference images. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves color alignment without compromising
image quality, bridging the gap between text semantics and visual generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models have not been adequately tested for mathematical reasoning in UAV-based remote sensing applications, which require precise computations for distance, area, trajectory estimation, and spatial analysis.

Method: Created AVI-Math benchmark with 3,773 high-quality vehicle-related questions from UAV views, covering 6 mathematical subjects and 20 topics. Collected data at varying altitudes and multiple angles to reflect real-world scenarios. Benchmarked 14 prominent VLMs and explored Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning techniques.

Result: Despite success on previous multimodal benchmarks, current VLMs struggle significantly with mathematical reasoning tasks in AVI-Math. The benchmark reveals substantial limitations in VLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities for UAV imagery.

Conclusion: The study exposes critical limitations in VLMs' mathematical reasoning abilities and suggests Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning as promising approaches. The findings provide valuable insights for developing more trustworthy VLMs for real-world UAV applications.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is critical for tasks such as precise distance and
area computations, trajectory estimations, and spatial analysis in unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing, yet current vision-language models
(VLMs) have not been adequately tested in this domain. To address this gap, we
introduce AVI-Math, the first benchmark to rigorously evaluate multimodal
mathematical reasoning in aerial vehicle imagery, moving beyond simple counting
tasks to include domain-specific knowledge in areas such as geometry, logic,
and algebra. The dataset comprises 3,773 high-quality vehicle-related questions
captured from UAV views, covering 6 mathematical subjects and 20 topics. The
data, collected at varying altitudes and from multiple UAV angles, reflects
real-world UAV scenarios, ensuring the diversity and complexity of the
constructed mathematical problems. In this paper, we benchmark 14 prominent
VLMs through a comprehensive evaluation and demonstrate that, despite their
success on previous multimodal benchmarks, these models struggle with the
reasoning tasks in AVI-Math. Our detailed analysis highlights significant
limitations in the mathematical reasoning capabilities of current VLMs and
suggests avenues for future research. Furthermore, we explore the use of
Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning techniques, which show promise in
addressing the reasoning challenges in AVI-Math. Our findings not only expose
the limitations of VLMs in mathematical reasoning but also offer valuable
insights for advancing UAV-based trustworthy VLMs in real-world applications.

### [35] [BEVTraj: Map-Free End-to-End Trajectory Prediction in Bird's-Eye View with Deformable Attention and Sparse Goal Proposals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10080)
*Minsang Kong,Myeongjun Kim,Sang Gu Kang,Sang Hun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEVTraj is a novel trajectory prediction framework that operates directly in BEV space using real-time sensor data, eliminating dependency on pre-built HD maps while achieving comparable performance to map-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory prediction methods rely on pre-built HD maps (limited to specific regions) or local map construction modules (may miss critical details or introduce errors), creating limitations in adaptability and accuracy.

Method: Proposes BEVTraj framework that uses deformable attention to extract context from dense BEV features and introduces Sparse Goal Candidate Proposal (SGCP) module for end-to-end prediction without post-processing.

Result: Extensive experiments show BEVTraj achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art HD map-based models while offering greater flexibility by eliminating map dependency.

Conclusion: BEVTraj provides a flexible and effective solution for trajectory prediction that doesn't require pre-built maps, making it more adaptable to various environments and transient changes.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safe
and efficient navigation. To improve prediction accuracy, recent approaches
often rely on pre-built high-definition (HD) maps or real-time local map
construction modules to incorporate static environmental information. However,
pre-built HD maps are limited to specific regions and cannot adapt to transient
changes. In addition, local map construction modules, which recognize only
predefined elements, may fail to capture critical scene details or introduce
errors that degrade prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Bird's-Eye View Trajectory Prediction (BEVTraj), a novel trajectory
prediction framework that operates directly in the bird's-eye view (BEV) space
utilizing real-time sensor data without relying on any pre-built maps. The
BEVTraj leverages deformable attention to efficiently extract relevant context
from dense BEV features. Furthermore, we introduce a Sparse Goal Candidate
Proposal (SGCP) module, which enables full end-to-end prediction without
requiring any post-processing steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
BEVTraj achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art HD map-based models
while offering greater flexibility by eliminating the dependency on pre-built
maps. The source code is available at https://github.com/Kongminsang/bevtraj.

*Laura Bragagnolo,Matteo Terreran,Leonardo Barcellona,Stefano Ghidoni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel training framework using multi-view information to improve multi-human parsing performance in occlusion scenarios, achieving 4.20% relative improvement over baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art multi-human parsing methods struggle with overlapping/occluded bodies, but different viewpoints can provide separation information for better parsing.

Method: Proposes a training framework with weak supervision on human instances and multi-view consistency loss, using semi-automatic annotation from multi-view RGB+D data and 3D human skeletons.

Result: Achieves up to 4.20% relative improvement on human parsing over baseline model in occlusion scenarios.

Conclusion: Multi-view information integration through novel training framework significantly enhances multi-human parsing performance under occlusions.

Abstract: Multi-human parsing is the task of segmenting human body parts while
associating each part to the person it belongs to, combining instance-level and
part-level information for fine-grained human understanding. In this work, we
demonstrate that, while state-of-the-art approaches achieved notable results on
public datasets, they struggle considerably in segmenting people with
overlapping bodies. From the intuition that overlapping people may appear
separated from a different point of view, we propose a novel training framework
exploiting multi-view information to improve multi-human parsing models under
occlusions. Our method integrates such knowledge during the training process,
introducing a novel approach based on weak supervision on human instances and a
multi-view consistency loss. Given the lack of suitable datasets in the
literature, we propose a semi-automatic annotation strategy to generate human
instance segmentation masks from multi-view RGB+D data and 3D human skeletons.
The experiments demonstrate that the approach can achieve up to a 4.20\%
relative improvement on human parsing over the baseline model in occlusion
scenarios.

Conclusion: VARCO-VISION-2.0 advances bilingual VLM development and practical applications, offering both full-scale and lightweight models for different deployment needs.

Abstract: We introduce VARCO-VISION-2.0, an open-weight bilingual vision-language model
(VLM) for Korean and English with improved capabilities compared to the
previous model VARCO-VISION-14B. The model supports multi-image understanding
for complex inputs such as documents, charts, and tables, and delivers
layoutaware OCR by predicting both textual content and its spatial location.
Trained with a four-stage curriculum with memory-efficient techniques, the
model achieves enhanced multimodal alignment, while preserving core language
abilities and improving safety via preference optimization. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate strong spatial grounding and competitive results for
both languages, with the 14B model achieving 8th place on the OpenCompass VLM
leaderboard among models of comparable scale. Alongside the 14B-scale model, we
release a 1.7B version optimized for on-device deployment. We believe these
models advance the development of bilingual VLMs and their practical
applications. Two variants of VARCO-VISION-2.0 are available at Hugging Face: a
full-scale 14B model and a lightweight 1.7B model.

*MohammadAli Hamidi,Hadi Amirpour,Luigi Atzori,Christian Timmerer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight face image quality assessment method using ensemble of MobileNetV3-Small and ShuffleNetV2 with correlation-aware loss, achieving high accuracy with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FIQA methods are either not face-specific or computationally intensive, limiting practical deployment in real-world face recognition systems.

Method: Ensemble of two compact CNNs (MobileNetV3-Small and ShuffleNetV2) with prediction-level fusion via averaging, using MSECorrLoss that combines MSE with Pearson correlation regularizer.

Result: Achieves SRCC of 0.9829 and PLCC of 0.9894 on VQualA benchmark while meeting efficiency constraints.

Conclusion: Proposed method provides an effective balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world face recognition applications.

Abstract: Face image quality assessment (FIQA) plays a critical role in face
recognition and verification systems, especially in uncontrolled, real-world
environments. Although several methods have been proposed, general-purpose
no-reference image quality assessment techniques often fail to capture
face-specific degradations. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art FIQA models tend to be
computationally intensive, limiting their practical applicability. We propose a
lightweight and efficient method for FIQA, designed for the perceptual
evaluation of face images in the wild. Our approach integrates an ensemble of
two compact convolutional neural networks, MobileNetV3-Small and ShuffleNetV2,
with prediction-level fusion via simple averaging. To enhance alignment with
human perceptual judgments, we employ a correlation-aware loss (MSECorrLoss),
combining mean squared error (MSE) with a Pearson correlation regularizer. Our
method achieves a strong balance between accuracy and computational cost,
making it suitable for real-world deployment. Experiments on the VQualA FIQA
benchmark demonstrate that our model achieves a Spearman rank correlation
coefficient (SRCC) of 0.9829 and a Pearson linear correlation coefficient
(PLCC) of 0.9894, remaining within competition efficiency constraints.

*Zongliang Wu,Siming Zheng,Peng-Tao Jiang,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RCOD is a one-step diffusion framework for real-world image super-resolution that enables explicit control over fidelity-realism trade-offs through latent domain grouping and degradation-aware sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-step diffusion methods for super-resolution lack flexible control mechanisms to balance fidelity and realism across diverse scenarios, unlike multi-step methods that can adjust sampling steps.

Method: Proposes RCOD framework with latent domain grouping strategy, degradation-aware sampling, and visual prompt injection module to replace text prompts with degradation-aware visual tokens for better control.

Result: Achieves superior fidelity and perceptual quality while maintaining computational efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art OSD methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Conclusion: RCOD provides flexible realism control capabilities during inference with minimal training modifications, demonstrating effective trade-off management between fidelity and realism in real-world image super-resolution.

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models have shown great potential in real-world image
super-resolution (Real-ISR) tasks by enabling high-resolution reconstructions.
While one-step diffusion (OSD) methods significantly improve efficiency
compared to traditional multi-step approaches, they still have limitations in
balancing fidelity and realism across diverse scenarios. Since the OSDs for SR
are usually trained or distilled by a single timestep, they lack flexible
control mechanisms to adaptively prioritize these competing objectives, which
are inherently manageable in multi-step methods through adjusting sampling
steps. To address this challenge, we propose a Realism Controlled One-step
Diffusion (RCOD) framework for Real-ISR. RCOD provides a latent domain grouping
strategy that enables explicit control over fidelity-realism trade-offs during
the noise prediction phase with minimal training paradigm modifications and
original training data. A degradation-aware sampling strategy is also
introduced to align distillation regularization with the grouping strategy and
enhance the controlling of trade-offs. Moreover, a visual prompt injection
module is used to replace conventional text prompts with degradation-aware
visual tokens, enhancing both restoration accuracy and semantic consistency.
Our method achieves superior fidelity and perceptual quality while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RCOD
outperforms state-of-the-art OSD methods in both quantitative metrics and
visual qualities, with flexible realism control capabilities in the inference
stage. The code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Grad-CL is a source-free domain adaptation framework for optic disc/cup segmentation that uses gradient-guided pseudolabel refinement and cosine similarity contrastive learning to improve cross-domain performance without accessing source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation models trained on one dataset perform poorly on target data from different imaging protocols/conditions, requiring robust domain adaptation without source data access.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Gradient-based mechanism extracts class-specific features for uncertainty quantification and prototype estimation to refine noisy pseudolabels, 2) Cosine similarity contrastive loss enforces inter-class separability between optic cup and disc features.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and source-free domain adaptation methods on cross-domain fundus imaging datasets with superior segmentation accuracy and improved boundary delineation.

Conclusion: Grad-CL effectively addresses domain shift in medical image segmentation without requiring source data, demonstrating strong performance in optic disc/cup segmentation across different imaging conditions.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the optic disc and cup is critical for the early
diagnosis and management of ocular diseases such as glaucoma. However,
segmentation models trained on one dataset often suffer significant performance
degradation when applied to target data acquired under different imaging
protocols or conditions. To address this challenge, we propose
\textbf{Grad-CL}, a novel source-free domain adaptation framework that
leverages a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data to robustly
adapt segmentation performance without requiring access to the original source
data. Grad-CL combines a gradient-guided pseudolabel refinement module with a
cosine similarity-based contrastive learning strategy. In the first stage,
salient class-specific features are extracted via a gradient-based mechanism,
enabling more accurate uncertainty quantification and robust prototype
estimation for refining noisy pseudolabels. In the second stage, a contrastive
loss based on cosine similarity is employed to explicitly enforce inter-class
separability between the gradient-informed features of the optic cup and disc.
Extensive experiments on challenging cross-domain fundus imaging datasets
demonstrate that Grad-CL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and
source-free domain adaptation methods, achieving superior segmentation accuracy
and improved boundary delineation. Project and code are available at

TL;DR: VQBridge enables 100% codebook usage in vector quantization networks through a compress-process-recover pipeline, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction and significantly improving image generation performance when integrated with LlamaGen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vector quantization training suffers from instability due to straight-through estimation bias, one-step-behind updates, and sparse codebook gradients, leading to suboptimal reconstruction and low codebook usage.

Method: Proposes VQBridge, a robust projector based on map function method that optimizes code vectors through compress-process-recover pipeline, combined with learning annealing to achieve full codebook usage.

Result: Achieves 100% codebook usage even with 262k-codebook, state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, consistent improvement with larger codebooks/higher channels/longer training, and effectiveness across different VQ variants. When integrated with LlamaGen, surpasses VAR by 0.5 and DiT by 0.2 rFID.

Conclusion: VQBridge provides stable and effective codebook training, demonstrating the importance of high-quality tokenizers for strong autoregressive image generation and enabling scalable, generalizable vector quantization with full codebook utilization.

Abstract: Vector quantization (VQ) is a key component in discrete tokenizers for image
generation, but its training is often unstable due to straight-through
estimation bias, one-step-behind updates, and sparse codebook gradients, which
lead to suboptimal reconstruction performance and low codebook usage. In this
work, we analyze these fundamental challenges and provide a simple yet
effective solution. To maintain high codebook usage in VQ networks (VQN) during
learning annealing and codebook size expansion, we propose VQBridge, a robust,
scalable, and efficient projector based on the map function method. VQBridge
optimizes code vectors through a compress-process-recover pipeline, enabling
stable and effective codebook training. By combining VQBridge with learning
annealing, our VQN achieves full (100%) codebook usage across diverse codebook
configurations, which we refer to as FVQ (FullVQ). Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that FVQ is effective, scalable, and generalizable:
it attains 100% codebook usage even with a 262k-codebook, achieves
state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, consistently improves with larger
codebooks, higher vector channels, or longer training, and remains effective
across different VQ variants. Moreover, when integrated with LlamaGen, FVQ
significantly enhances image generation performance, surpassing visual
autoregressive models (VAR) by 0.5 and diffusion models (DiT) by 0.2 rFID,
highlighting the importance of high-quality tokenizers for strong
autoregressive image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerLock is a self-supervised learning method that accelerates masked-autoencoding by progressively freezing ViT layers according to their convergence order, enabling efficient latent prediction without representation collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the observation that ViT layers converge at different rates during training (shallower layers converge early, deeper layers converge late) and leverage this to accelerate masked-autoencoding while avoiding representation collapse in latent prediction.

Method: LayerLock progressively freezes ViT layers throughout training according to an explicit schedule based on their convergence order, transitioning from pixel to latent prediction through layer freezing.

Result: The approach was applied to models up to 4B parameters and achieved results surpassing non-latent masked prediction on the 4DS perception suite.

Conclusion: LayerLock provides a simple, scalable, and effective approach for self-supervised visual representation learning that exploits the natural convergence order of ViT layers to accelerate training and enable stable latent prediction.

Abstract: We introduce LayerLock, a simple yet effective approach for self-supervised
visual representation learning, that gradually transitions from pixel to latent
prediction through progressive layer freezing. First, we make the observation
that during training of video masked-autoencoding (MAE) models, ViT layers
converge in the order of their depth: shallower layers converge early, deeper
layers converge late. We then show that this observation can be exploited to
accelerate standard MAE by progressively freezing the model according to an
explicit schedule, throughout training. Furthermore, this same schedule can be
used in a simple and scalable approach to latent prediction that does not
suffer from "representation collapse". We apply our proposed approach,
LayerLock, to large models of up to 4B parameters with results surpassing those
of non-latent masked prediction on the 4DS perception suite.

*Elias De Smijter,Renaud Detry,Christophe De Vleeschouwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Appearance embeddings improve photometric fidelity but don't significantly enhance geometric accuracy in 3D object reconstruction for space applications. Explicit methods like convex splatting provide more compact representations than Gaussian splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of appearance embeddings in space-based 3D object reconstruction and evaluate their impact on geometric accuracy for space robotics applications where precise geometry is critical.

Method: Systematic comparison of implicit and explicit Novel View Synthesis methods (K-Planes, Gaussian Splatting, Convex Splatting) using the SPEED+ dataset, analyzing the effects of appearance embeddings on photometric fidelity and geometric accuracy.

Result: Appearance embeddings primarily reduce the number of primitives needed for explicit methods rather than improving geometric fidelity. Convex splatting achieves more compact and clutter-free representations than Gaussian splatting.

Conclusion: Appearance embeddings have limited benefits for geometry-centric tasks in space scenarios. Convex splatting offers advantages for safety-critical applications requiring compact representations for interaction and collision avoidance.

Abstract: We present the first systematic comparison of implicit and explicit Novel
View Synthesis methods for space-based 3D object reconstruction, evaluating the
role of appearance embeddings. While embeddings improve photometric fidelity by
modeling lighting variation, we show they do not translate into meaningful
gains in geometric accuracy - a critical requirement for space robotics
applications. Using the SPEED+ dataset, we compare K-Planes, Gaussian
Splatting, and Convex Splatting, and demonstrate that embeddings primarily
reduce the number of primitives needed for explicit methods rather than
enhancing geometric fidelity. Moreover, convex splatting achieves more compact
and clutter-free representations than Gaussian splatting, offering advantages
for safety-critical applications such as interaction and collision avoidance.
Our findings clarify the limits of appearance embeddings for geometry-centric
tasks and highlight trade-offs between reconstruction quality and
representation efficiency in space scenarios.

*Haozhen Yan,Yan Hong,Suning Lang,Jiahui Zhan,Yikun Ji,Yujie Gao,Jun Lan,Huijia Zhu,Weiqiang Wang,Jianfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAMMA is a novel training framework that improves generalization for AI-generated image detection by reducing domain bias and enhancing semantic alignment through diverse manipulation strategies and multi-task supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-generated image detectors perform well on in-distribution images but struggle with generalization to unseen generative models due to reliance on generation-specific artifacts like stylistic priors and compression patterns.

Method: Proposes GAMMA framework with diverse manipulation strategies (inpainting-based manipulation, semantics-preserving perturbations), multi-task supervision with dual segmentation heads and classification head, and a reverse cross-attention mechanism to correct biased representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on GenImage benchmark with 5.8% accuracy improvement and maintains strong robustness on newly released generative models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: GAMMA effectively addresses generalization limitations in AI-generated image detection by reducing domain bias and improving semantic alignment, demonstrating superior performance across diverse generative domains.

Abstract: With generative models becoming increasingly sophisticated and diverse,
detecting AI-generated images has become increasingly challenging. While
existing AI-genereted Image detectors achieve promising performance on
in-distribution generated images, their generalization to unseen generative
models remains limited. This limitation is largely attributed to their reliance
on generation-specific artifacts, such as stylistic priors and compression
patterns. To address these limitations, we propose GAMMA, a novel training
framework designed to reduce domain bias and enhance semantic alignment. GAMMA
introduces diverse manipulation strategies, such as inpainting-based
manipulation and semantics-preserving perturbations, to ensure consistency
between manipulated and authentic content. We employ multi-task supervision
with dual segmentation heads and a classification head, enabling pixel-level
source attribution across diverse generative domains. In addition, a reverse
cross-attention mechanism is introduced to allow the segmentation heads to
guide and correct biased representations in the classification branch. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on the GenImage
benchmark, imporving accuracy by 5.8%, but also maintains strong robustness on
newly released generative model such as GPT-4o.

### [45] [Robustness and Diagnostic Performance of Super-Resolution Fetal Brain MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10257)
*Ema Masterl,Tina Vipotnik Vesnaver,Žiga Špiclin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparison of three fetal brain MRI super-resolution reconstruction methods (NiftyMIC, SVRTK, NeSVoR) shows NeSVoR has highest success rate (>90%) and robustness across healthy and pathological cases, with diagnostic classification unaffected by SRR method choice despite volumetric differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fetal brain MRI suffers from low resolution, motion artifacts, and inadequate 3D anatomy capture. While SRR methods exist, their comparative performance in pathological cases and impact on downstream analysis remain underexplored.

Method: Applied three SRR methods (NiftyMIC, SVRTK, NeSVoR) to 140 fetal brain MRI scans (healthy controls and pathological cases with ventriculomegaly), segmented using BoUNTi algorithm to extract volumes of nine brain structures, and evaluated visual quality, success rates, volumetric agreement, and diagnostic classification.

Result: NeSVoR demonstrated highest reconstruction success rate (>90%) across both groups. Significant volumetric differences between methods were observed, but VM classification performance was not affected by SRR method choice.

Conclusion: NeSVoR shows superior robustness, and diagnostic performance remains resilient despite SRR-induced volumetric variability, highlighting its clinical utility for fetal brain MRI analysis.

Abstract: Fetal brain MRI relies on rapid multi-view 2D slice acquisitions to reduce
motion artifacts caused by fetal movement. However, these stacks are typically
low resolution, may suffer from motion corruption, and do not adequately
capture 3D anatomy. Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) methods aim to
address these limitations by combining slice-to-volume registration and
super-resolution techniques to generate high-resolution (HR) 3D volumes. While
several SRR methods have been proposed, their comparative performance -
particularly in pathological cases - and their influence on downstream
volumetric analysis and diagnostic tasks remain underexplored. In this study,
we applied three state-of-the-art SRR method - NiftyMIC, SVRTK, and NeSVoR - to
140 fetal brain MRI scans, including both healthy controls (HC) and
pathological cases (PC) with ventriculomegaly (VM). Each HR reconstruction was
segmented using the BoUNTi algorithm to extract volumes of nine principal brain
structures. We evaluated visual quality, SRR success rates, volumetric
measurement agreement, and diagnostic classification performance. NeSVoR
demonstrated the highest and most consistent reconstruction success rate (>90%)
across both HC and PC groups. Although significant differences in volumetric
estimates were observed between SRR methods, classification performance for VM
was not affected by the choice of SRR method. These findings highlight NeSVoR's
robustness and the resilience of diagnostic performance despite SRR-induced
volumetric variability.

### [46] [Mask Consistency Regularization in Object Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10259)
*Hua Yuan,Jin Yuan,Yicheng Jiang,Yao Zhang,Xin Geng,Yong Rui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Mask Consistency Regularization (MCR) to address mask hallucination and mask-shape bias in object removal tasks using diffusion models, through dilation and reshape mask perturbations during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for object removal suffer from mask hallucination (generating irrelevant content) and mask-shape bias (filling masked area with object mimicking mask shape rather than surrounding context).

Method: Introduces Mask Consistency Regularization (MCR) with two mask perturbations: dilation masks to align output with surrounding content, and reshaped masks to break mask-shape bias, enforcing consistency between perturbed branches and original mask.

Result: MCR significantly reduces hallucinations and mask-shape bias, leading to improved performance in object removal tasks with more robust and contextually coherent inpainting results.

Conclusion: The proposed MCR training strategy effectively addresses key challenges in object removal by enforcing mask consistency through strategic perturbations, resulting in superior inpainting quality and reduced artifacts.

Abstract: Object removal, a challenging task within image inpainting, involves
seamlessly filling the removed region with content that matches the surrounding
context. Despite advancements in diffusion models, current methods still face
two critical challenges. The first is mask hallucination, where the model
generates irrelevant or spurious content inside the masked region, and the
second is mask-shape bias, where the model fills the masked area with an object
that mimics the mask's shape rather than surrounding content. To address these
issues, we propose Mask Consistency Regularization (MCR), a novel training
strategy designed specifically for object removal tasks. During training, our
approach introduces two mask perturbations: dilation and reshape, enforcing
consistency between the outputs of these perturbed branches and the original
mask. The dilated masks help align the model's output with the surrounding
content, while reshaped masks encourage the model to break the mask-shape bias.
This combination of strategies enables MCR to produce more robust and
contextually coherent inpainting results. Our experiments demonstrate that MCR
significantly reduces hallucinations and mask-shape bias, leading to improved
performance in object removal.

### [47] [MagicMirror: A Large-Scale Dataset and Benchmark for Fine-Grained Artifacts Assessment in Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10260)
*Jia Wang,Jie Hu,Xiaoqi Ma,Hanghang Ma,Yanbing Zeng,Xiaoming Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagicMirror is a comprehensive framework for assessing physical artifacts in text-to-image generation, featuring a detailed artifact taxonomy, large-scale human-annotated dataset, and trained VLM assessor with novel optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models suffer from persistent physical artifacts (anatomical and structural flaws) that degrade perceptual quality, but lack systematic evaluation frameworks to address these issues.

Method: Developed detailed artifact taxonomy, created MagicData340K (340K human-annotated images), trained MagicAssessor VLM with novel data sampling and multi-level reward system using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: MagicAssessor provides detailed artifact assessments, and MagicBench evaluation reveals that even top-tier models like GPT-image-1 consistently suffer from significant artifacts.

Conclusion: Artifact reduction remains a critical challenge for text-to-image generation, and MagicMirror provides the necessary framework for systematic evaluation and improvement of future models.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has achieved remarkable progress in
instruction following and aesthetics. However, a persistent challenge is the
prevalence of physical artifacts, such as anatomical and structural flaws,
which severely degrade perceptual quality and limit application. Given the
diversity and complexity of these artifacts, a systematic and fine-grained
evaluation framework is required, which is lacking in current benchmarks. To
fill this gap, we introduce MagicMirror, a comprehensive framework for
artifacts assessment. We first establish a detailed taxonomy of generated image
artifacts. Guided by this taxonomy, we manually annotate MagicData340K, the
first human-annotated large-scale dataset of 340K generated images with
fine-grained artifact labels. Building on this dataset, we train MagicAssessor,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that provides detailed assessments and
corresponding labels. To overcome challenges like class imbalance and reward
hacking, we design a novel data sampling strategy and a multi-level reward
system for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Finally, we leverage
MagicAssessor to construct MagicBench, an automated benchmark for evaluating
the image artifacts of current T2I models. Our evaluation with MagicBench
reveals that despite their widespread adoption, even top-tier models like
GPT-image-1 are consistently plagued by significant artifacts, highlighting
artifact reduction as a critical frontier for future T2I development. Project

*Wenfang Wu,Tingting Yuan,Yupeng Li,Daling Wang,Xiaoming Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SignClip improves sign language translation by fusing manual (hand gestures) and non-manual (lip movements) cues using hierarchical contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most sign language translation approaches focus only on manual signals and overlook non-manual cues like mouthing, which are crucial for disambiguating visually similar signs and conveying essential linguistic information.

Method: Proposes SignClip framework that fuses spatial gesture and lip movement features, and introduces hierarchical contrastive learning with multi-level alignment objectives to ensure semantic consistency across sign-lip and visual-text modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets show superiority. On PHOENIX14T (gloss-free setting), SignClip improves BLEU-4 from 24.32 to 24.71 and ROUGE from 46.57 to 48.38, surpassing previous state-of-the-art SpaMo model.

Conclusion: The integration of both manual and non-manual cues through the proposed SignClip framework significantly enhances sign language translation accuracy, demonstrating the importance of considering comprehensive visual information including mouthing patterns.

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) aims to translate natural language from sign
language videos, serving as a vital bridge for inclusive communication. While
recent advances leverage powerful visual backbones and large language models,
most approaches mainly focus on manual signals (hand gestures) and tend to
overlook non-manual cues like mouthing. In fact, mouthing conveys essential
linguistic information in sign languages and plays a crucial role in
disambiguating visually similar signs. In this paper, we propose SignClip, a
novel framework to improve the accuracy of sign language translation. It fuses
manual and non-manual cues, specifically spatial gesture and lip movement
features. Besides, SignClip introduces a hierarchical contrastive learning
framework with multi-level alignment objectives, ensuring semantic consistency
across sign-lip and visual-text modalities. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign, demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. For example, on PHOENIX14T, in the Gloss-free setting, SignClip
surpasses the previous state-of-the-art model SpaMo, improving BLEU-4 from
24.32 to 24.71, and ROUGE from 46.57 to 48.38.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of VLMs for text manipulation detection shows open-source models are improving but still lag behind closed-source models like GPT-4o, with generalization issues in specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Large Vision Language Models have shown effectiveness in image manipulation detection, text manipulation detection remains largely unexplored, creating a knowledge gap that needs to be addressed.

Method: Benchmarked both closed- and open-source VLMs on various text manipulation datasets, including in-the-wild scene texts and fantasy ID cards that simulate real-world misuse scenarios.

Result: Open-source models are getting closer in performance but still behind closed-source models like GPT-4o. Image manipulation detection-specific VLMs suffer from generalization problems when applied to text manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: There is a significant performance gap between open-source and closed-source VLMs for text manipulation detection, and specialized models need better generalization capabilities for cross-domain applications.

Abstract: Recent works have shown the effectiveness of Large Vision Language Models
(VLMs or LVLMs) in image manipulation detection. However, text manipulation
detection is largely missing in these studies. We bridge this knowledge gap by
analyzing closed- and open-source VLMs on different text manipulation datasets.
Our results suggest that open-source models are getting closer, but still
behind closed-source ones like GPT- 4o. Additionally, we benchmark image
manipulation detection-specific VLMs for text manipulation detection and show
that they suffer from the generalization problem. We benchmark VLMs for
manipulations done on in-the-wild scene texts and on fantasy ID cards, where
the latter mimic a challenging real-world misuse.

TL;DR: MCL-AD is a novel zero-shot 3D anomaly detection framework that leverages multimodal collaboration across point clouds, RGB images, and text semantics to achieve superior performance without labeled training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus only on point clouds and neglect rich semantic cues from complementary modalities like RGB images and text priors, which limits performance in zero-shot 3D anomaly detection scenarios.

Method: Proposes Multimodal Prompt Learning Mechanism (MPLM) with object-agnostic decoupled text prompts and multimodal contrastive loss, plus Collaborative Modulation Mechanism (CMM) to jointly modulate RGB image-guided and point cloud-guided branches.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot 3D anomaly detection.

Conclusion: MCL-AD framework effectively leverages multimodal collaboration across point clouds, RGB images, and text semantics to achieve superior zero-shot 3D anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D (ZS-3D) anomaly detection aims to identify defects in 3D objects
without relying on labeled training data, making it especially valuable in
scenarios constrained by data scarcity, privacy, or high annotation cost.
However, most existing methods focus exclusively on point clouds, neglecting
the rich semantic cues available from complementary modalities such as RGB
images and texts priors. This paper introduces MCL-AD, a novel framework that
leverages multimodal collaboration learning across point clouds, RGB images,
and texts semantics to achieve superior zero-shot 3D anomaly detection.
Specifically, we propose a Multimodal Prompt Learning Mechanism (MPLM) that
enhances the intra-modal representation capability and inter-modal
collaborative learning by introducing an object-agnostic decoupled text prompt
and a multimodal contrastive loss. In addition, a collaborative modulation
mechanism (CMM) is proposed to fully leverage the complementary representations
of point clouds and RGB images by jointly modulating the RGB image-guided and
point cloud-guided branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed MCL-AD framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-3D
anomaly detection.

Motivation: Deep neural networks and Vision Transformers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defenses are computationally expensive or lack formal guarantees.

Method: Proposed a Lipschitz-guided stochastic depth (DropPath) method where drop probabilities increase with depth to control the effective Lipschitz constant, regularizing deeper layers.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ViT-Tiny show near-baseline clean accuracy, enhanced robustness against FGSM, PGD-20, and AutoAttack attacks, and significant FLOPs reduction compared to baseline and linear DropPath schedules.

Conclusion: The depth-dependent drop probability schedule effectively improves adversarial robustness while preserving accuracy and reducing computational cost in Vision Transformers.

Abstract: Deep neural networks and Vision Transformers achieve state-of-the-art
performance in computer vision but are highly vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations. Standard defenses often incur high computational cost or lack
formal guarantees. We propose a Lipschitz-guided stochastic depth (DropPath)

TL;DR: Probabilistic framework using energy maps and stochastic optimization for precise geolocation of street furniture in urban environments


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical need for effective monitoring and maintenance of public infrastructure by local authorities and private stakeholders through accurate geolocation

Method: Energy maps encoding spatial likelihood of object locations, integrated with external geospatial information (GIS layers, road maps, constraints), using stochastic birth-and-death optimization algorithm

Result: Evaluated with realistic simulation based on geolocated street lighting data in Dublin city center, showing potential for scalable and accurate urban asset mapping

Conclusion: Proposed framework enables seamless integration of contextual geospatial information and improves localization accuracy for urban infrastructure mapping

Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of precise geolocation of street
furniture in complex urban environments, which is a critical task for effective
monitoring and maintenance of public infrastructure by local authorities and
private stakeholders. To this end, we propose a probabilistic framework based
on energy maps that encode the spatial likelihood of object locations.
Representing the energy in a map-based geopositioned format allows the
optimisation process to seamlessly integrate external geospatial information,
such as GIS layers, road maps, or placement constraints, which improves
contextual awareness and localisation accuracy. A stochastic birth-and-death
optimisation algorithm is introduced to infer the most probable configuration
of assets. We evaluate our approach using a realistic simulation informed by a
geolocated dataset of street lighting infrastructure in Dublin city centre,
demonstrating its potential for scalable and accurate urban asset mapping. The
implementation of the algorithm will be made available in the GitHub repository

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClusCa accelerates diffusion transformers by performing spatial clustering to reduce token computation by over 90%, achieving 4.96x speedup on FLUX with improved quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers suffer from high computational costs due to iterative denoising, and existing feature caching methods only leverage temporal similarity while ignoring spatial similarity.

Method: Cluster-Driven Feature Caching (ClusCa) performs spatial clustering on tokens, computes only one token per cluster, and propagates information to all other tokens in the cluster.

Result: Achieves 4.96x acceleration on FLUX with 99.49% ImageReward (0.51% improvement over original), works on DiT, FLUX and HunyuanVideo without training requirements.

Conclusion: ClusCa provides an effective orthogonal approach to existing feature caching methods by leveraging spatial similarity, significantly accelerating diffusion transformers while maintaining or improving output quality.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have gained significant attention in recent years for
their ability to generate high-quality images and videos, yet still suffer from
a huge computational cost due to their iterative denoising process. Recently,
feature caching has been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by
caching the feature computation in previous timesteps and reusing it in the
following timesteps, which leverage the temporal similarity of diffusion models
while ignoring the similarity in the spatial dimension. In this paper, we
introduce Cluster-Driven Feature Caching (ClusCa) as an orthogonal and
complementary perspective for previous feature caching. Specifically, ClusCa
performs spatial clustering on tokens in each timestep, computes only one token
in each cluster and propagates their information to all the other tokens, which
is able to reduce the number of tokens by over 90%. Extensive experiments on
DiT, FLUX and HunyuanVideo demonstrate its effectiveness in both text-to-image
and text-to-video generation. Besides, it can be directly applied to any
diffusion transformer without requirements for training. For instance, ClusCa
achieves 4.96x acceleration on FLUX with an ImageReward of 99.49%, surpassing
the original model by 0.51%. The code is available at

TL;DR: I-Segmenter is the first fully integer-only Vision Transformer framework for semantic segmentation that achieves near-FP32 accuracy while significantly reducing model size and enabling faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers for semantic segmentation have high memory and computational costs, making deployment on resource-constrained devices challenging. Quantization helps but ViT-based segmentation models are fragile under low precision due to quantization error accumulation.

Method: Built on Segmenter architecture, replaces floating-point operations with integer-only counterparts. Introduces λ-ShiftGELU activation to handle long-tailed distributions, removes L2 normalization, and replaces bilinear interpolation with nearest neighbor upsampling for full integer execution.

Result: Achieves accuracy within 5.1% of FP32 baseline on average, reduces model size by up to 3.8x, enables 1.2x faster inference. Works well even with one-shot PTQ using a single calibration image.

Conclusion: I-Segmenter provides a practical integer-only solution for efficient ViT segmentation deployment with competitive accuracy and significant efficiency gains, making it suitable for real-world applications on constrained devices.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently achieved strong results in semantic
segmentation, yet their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains
limited due to their high memory footprint and computational cost. Quantization
offers an effective strategy to improve efficiency, but ViT-based segmentation
models are notoriously fragile under low precision, as quantization errors
accumulate across deep encoder-decoder pipelines. We introduce I-Segmenter, the
first fully integer-only ViT segmentation framework. Building on the Segmenter
architecture, I-Segmenter systematically replaces floating-point operations
with integer-only counterparts. To further stabilize both training and
inference, we propose $\lambda$-ShiftGELU, a novel activation function that
mitigates the limitations of uniform quantization in handling long-tailed
activation distributions. In addition, we remove the L2 normalization layer and
replace bilinear interpolation in the decoder with nearest neighbor upsampling,
ensuring integer-only execution throughout the computational graph. Extensive
experiments show that I-Segmenter achieves accuracy within a reasonable margin
of its FP32 baseline (5.1 % on average), while reducing model size by up to
3.8x and enabling up to 1.2x faster inference with optimized runtimes. Notably,
even in one-shot PTQ with a single calibration image, I-Segmenter delivers
competitive accuracy, underscoring its practicality for real-world deployment.

*Botond Fazekas,Thomas Pinetz,Guilherme Aresta,Taha Emre,Hrvoje Bogunovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GARD is a novel deep learning approach for OCT image denoising that uses gamma-based diffusion models instead of Gaussian noise assumptions, with a noise-reduced fidelity term to prevent noise reintroduction and accelerated inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT images suffer from speckle noise that obscures fine details and hinders accurate diagnosis. Existing denoising methods struggle to balance noise reduction with preservation of crucial anatomical structures.

Method: GARD employs a Denoising Diffusion Gamma Model to better reflect speckle statistics, introduces a Noise-Reduced Fidelity Term using pre-processed images to guide denoising, and adapts the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model framework for faster inference.

Result: GARD significantly outperforms traditional methods and state-of-the-art deep learning models in PSNR, SSIM, and MSE metrics. Qualitative results show sharper edges and better preservation of fine anatomical details.

Conclusion: GARD provides an effective solution for OCT image despeckling by accurately modeling speckle statistics and preventing noise reintroduction, resulting in superior image quality and structural preservation compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a vital imaging modality for diagnosing
and monitoring retinal diseases. However, OCT images are inherently degraded by
speckle noise, which obscures fine details and hinders accurate interpretation.
While numerous denoising methods exist, many struggle to balance noise
reduction with the preservation of crucial anatomical structures. This paper
introduces GARD (Gamma-based Anatomical Restoration and Denoising), a novel
deep learning approach for OCT image despeckling that leverages the strengths
of diffusion probabilistic models. Unlike conventional diffusion models that
assume Gaussian noise, GARD employs a Denoising Diffusion Gamma Model to more
accurately reflect the statistical properties of speckle. Furthermore, we
introduce a Noise-Reduced Fidelity Term that utilizes a pre-processed,
less-noisy image to guide the denoising process. This crucial addition prevents
the reintroduction of high-frequency noise. We accelerate the inference process
by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model framework to our Gamma-based
model. Experiments on a dataset with paired noisy and less-noisy OCT B-scans
demonstrate that GARD significantly outperforms traditional denoising methods
and state-of-the-art deep learning models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and MSE.
Qualitative results confirm that GARD produces sharper edges and better
preserves fine anatomical details.

*Yuexi Du,Lihui Chen,Nicha C. Dvornek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLAM is a visual language model that uses geometry-guided global and local alignment for multi-view mammography analysis, outperforming existing methods by properly modeling cross-view relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mammography VLMs adapted from natural images ignore domain-specific multi-view relationships that radiologists use, losing critical geometric context and resulting in suboptimal predictions.

Method: Proposes GLAM model with geometry guidance for VLM pretraining, using joint global and local contrastive learning (visual-visual and visual-language) to learn cross-view alignments and fine-grained local features from multi-view mammograms.

Result: Pretrained on the large EMBED mammography dataset, GLAM outperforms baseline methods across multiple datasets under different settings.

Conclusion: The geometry-guided approach successfully captures the multi-view relationships essential for mammography interpretation, demonstrating improved performance over methods that treat views independently.

Abstract: Mammography screening is an essential tool for early detection of breast
cancer. The speed and accuracy of mammography interpretation have the potential
to be improved with deep learning methods. However, the development of a
foundation visual language model (VLM) is hindered by limited data and domain
differences between natural and medical images. Existing mammography VLMs,
adapted from natural images, often ignore domain-specific characteristics, such
as multi-view relationships in mammography. Unlike radiologists who analyze
both views together to process ipsilateral correspondence, current methods
treat them as independent images or do not properly model the multi-view
correspondence learning, losing critical geometric context and resulting in
suboptimal prediction. We propose GLAM: Global and Local Alignment for
Multi-view mammography for VLM pretraining using geometry guidance. By
leveraging the prior knowledge about the multi-view imaging process of
mammograms, our model learns local cross-view alignments and fine-grained local
features through joint global and local, visual-visual, and visual-language
contrastive learning. Pretrained on EMBED [14], one of the largest open
mammography datasets, our model outperforms baselines across multiple datasets

*Georgios Pantazopoulos,Eda B. Özyiğit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey on visual grounding in vision language models, covering its importance, core components, applications, benchmarks, and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual grounding enables models to identify specific regions in visual inputs that match textual descriptions, which is crucial for various applications like referring expression comprehension, visual question answering, and fine-grained control in environments.

Method: The paper reviews representative works across key research areas of modern vision language models, outlining the importance of grounding, delineating core components of grounded model development, and examining practical applications including benchmarks and evaluation metrics.

Result: The survey provides a comprehensive analysis of visual grounding in VLMs, examining its interrelations with multimodal chain-of-thought and reasoning, while identifying practical applications across various domains.

Conclusion: The paper identifies challenges inherent to visual grounding and suggests promising directions for future research, emphasizing the importance of this capability for advancing vision language models.

Abstract: Visual grounding refers to the ability of a model to identify a region within
some visual input that matches a textual description. Consequently, a model
equipped with visual grounding capabilities can target a wide range of
applications in various domains, including referring expression comprehension,
answering questions pertinent to fine-grained details in images or videos,
caption visual context by explicitly referring to entities, as well as low and
high-level control in simulated and real environments. In this survey paper, we
review representative works across the key areas of research on modern
general-purpose vision language models (VLMs). We first outline the importance
of grounding in VLMs, then delineate the core components of the contemporary
paradigm for developing grounded models, and examine their practical
applications, including benchmarks and evaluation metrics for grounded
multimodal generation. We also discuss the multifaceted interrelations among
visual grounding, multimodal chain-of-thought, and reasoning in VLMs. Finally,
we analyse the challenges inherent to visual grounding and suggest promising
directions for future research.

### [58] [Immunizing Images from Text to Image Editing via Adversarial Cross-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10359)
*Matteo Trippodo,Federico Becattini,Lorenzo Seidenari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Attention Attack disrupts text-based image editing by using auto-generated captions to break cross-attention alignment between images and text prompts, without needing knowledge of the editing method or prompt.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based image editing methods are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly targeting the visual-textual alignment that enables fine-grained manipulation guided by natural language.

Method: Proposes Attention Attack that uses automatically generated captions of source images as proxy prompts to disrupt cross-attention mechanisms between visual representations and textual descriptions.

Result: Experiments on TEDBench++ show the attack significantly degrades editing performance while remaining imperceptible, with novel evaluation metrics (Caption Similarity and semantic IoU) demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The attack successfully breaks image-text alignment without requiring knowledge of editing methods or prompts, revealing vulnerabilities in current text-based image editing systems and proposing better evaluation metrics for immunization success.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-based image editing have enabled fine-grained
manipulation of visual content guided by natural language. However, such
methods are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a
novel attack that targets the visual component of editing methods. We introduce
Attention Attack, which disrupts the cross-attention between a textual prompt
and the visual representation of the image by using an automatically generated
caption of the source image as a proxy for the edit prompt. This breaks the
alignment between the contents of the image and their textual description,
without requiring knowledge of the editing method or the editing prompt.
Reflecting on the reliability of existing metrics for immunization success, we
propose two novel evaluation strategies: Caption Similarity, which quantifies
semantic consistency between original and adversarial edits, and semantic
Intersection over Union (IoU), which measures spatial layout disruption via
segmentation masks. Experiments conducted on the TEDBench++ benchmark
demonstrate that our attack significantly degrades editing performance while
remaining imperceptible.

*Iacopo Curti,Pierluigi Zama Ramirez,Alioscia Petrelli,Luigi Di Stefano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM SAM-adapter extends Segment Anything Model for multimodal semantic segmentation by using an adapter network to fuse auxiliary sensor data with RGB features, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic segmentation methods are vulnerable to challenging conditions like poor lighting, occlusions, and adverse weather. Multimodal approaches that integrate auxiliary sensor data can provide complementary information to enhance robustness.

Method: Proposes an adapter network that injects fused multimodal features into SAM's RGB features, enabling selective incorporation of auxiliary modalities only when they provide additional cues while maintaining RGB generalization ability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging benchmarks (DeLiVER, FMB, MUSES). Outperforms competing methods in both RGB-easy and RGB-hard subsets, demonstrating effectiveness in both favorable and adverse conditions.

Conclusion: The framework provides balanced and efficient use of multimodal information for robust scene understanding, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal adaptation in semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation, a key task in computer vision with broad applications
in autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics, has advanced
substantially with deep learning. Nevertheless, current approaches remain
vulnerable to challenging conditions such as poor lighting, occlusions, and
adverse weather. To address these limitations, multimodal methods that
integrate auxiliary sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, infrared) have recently emerged,
providing complementary information that enhances robustness. In this work, we
present MM SAM-adapter, a novel framework that extends the capabilities of the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) for multimodal semantic segmentation. The proposed
method employs an adapter network that injects fused multimodal features into
SAM's rich RGB features. This design enables the model to retain the strong
generalization ability of RGB features while selectively incorporating
auxiliary modalities only when they contribute additional cues. As a result, MM
SAM-adapter achieves a balanced and efficient use of multimodal information. We
evaluate our approach on three challenging benchmarks, DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES,
where MM SAM-adapter delivers state-of-the-art performance. To further analyze
modality contributions, we partition DeLiVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard
subsets. Results consistently demonstrate that our framework outperforms
competing methods in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting the
effectiveness of multimodal adaptation for robust scene understanding. The code

*Fabien Allemand,Attilio Fiandrotti,Sumanta Chaudhuri,Alaa Eddine Mazouz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Knowledge distillation reduces neural image compression model size while maintaining performance, making it suitable for resource-constrained platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network-based image compression outperforms conventional codecs but requires significant processing power, limiting real-time deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Leverage knowledge distillation where smaller neural networks are trained using outputs from larger, more complex teacher models to achieve better compression performance with reduced resource requirements.

Result: Knowledge distillation effectively reduces processing and energy requirements across various architecture sizes while maintaining different image quality/bit rate tradeoffs.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation is a viable approach for deploying efficient neural image compression, with potential for extension to transformer-based models and exploration of different teacher models and loss functions.

Abstract: Learned image compression sits at the intersection of machine learning and
image processing. With advances in deep learning, neural network-based
compression methods have emerged. In this process, an encoder maps the image to
a low-dimensional latent space, which is then quantized, entropy-coded into a
binary bitstream, and transmitted to the receiver. At the receiver end, the
bitstream is entropy-decoded, and a decoder reconstructs an approximation of
the original image. Recent research suggests that these models consistently
outperform conventional codecs. However, they require significant processing
power, making them unsuitable for real-time use on resource-constrained
platforms, which hinders their deployment in mainstream applications. This
study aims to reduce the resource requirements of neural networks used for
image compression by leveraging knowledge distillation, a training paradigm
where smaller neural networks, partially trained on the outputs of larger, more
complex models, can achieve better performance than when trained independently.
Our work demonstrates that knowledge distillation can be effectively applied to
image compression tasks: i) across various architecture sizes, ii) to achieve
different image quality/bit rate tradeoffs, and iii) to save processing and
energy resources. This approach introduces new settings and hyperparameters,
and future research could explore the impact of different teacher models, as
well as alternative loss functions. Knowledge distillation could also be
extended to transformer-based models. The code is publicly available at:

*Zeqing Leo Yuan,Mani Ramanagopal,Aswin C. Sankaranarayanan,Srinivasa G. Narasimhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free intrinsic image decomposition using visible-thermal image pairs, leveraging thermal absorption to derive shading/reflectance ordinalities for self-supervised optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of extensive ground-truth data for real-world intrinsic image decomposition, with existing methods relying on synthetic data or sparse annotations for limited scenes.

Method: Uses visible-thermal image pairs and the principle that absorbed light becomes heat detected by thermal cameras. Relates ordinalities between visible/thermal intensities to shading/reflectance ordinalities to densely self-supervise a neural network.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance over recent learning-based models in quantitative evaluations with known reflectance/shading under natural/artificial lighting, and qualitative experiments across diverse outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable path to curating real-world ordinal supervision previously infeasible through manual labeling, enabling effective intrinsic image decomposition without extensive training data.

Abstract: Decomposing an image into its intrinsic photometric factors--shading and
reflectance--is a long-standing challenge due to the lack of extensive
ground-truth data for real-world scenes. Recent methods rely on synthetic data
or sparse annotations for limited indoor and even fewer outdoor scenes. We
introduce a novel training-free approach for intrinsic image decomposition
using only a pair of visible and thermal images. We leverage the principle that
light not reflected from an opaque surface is absorbed and detected as heat by
a thermal camera. This allows us to relate the ordinalities between visible and
thermal image intensities to the ordinalities of shading and reflectance, which
can densely self-supervise an optimizing neural network to recover shading and
reflectance. We perform quantitative evaluations with known reflectance and
shading under natural and artificial lighting, and qualitative experiments
across diverse outdoor scenes. The results demonstrate superior performance
over recent learning-based models and point toward a scalable path to curating
real-world ordinal supervision, previously infeasible via manual labeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive survey on compressed video quality enhancement (CVQE) methods, addressing limitations in existing surveys by providing a systematic taxonomy, unified benchmarking framework, and analysis of performance-complexity trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVQE surveys lack systematic classification linking methods to specific standards and artifacts, insufficient comparative analysis across architectural paradigms, and underdeveloped benchmarking practices, creating gaps in the field.

Method: The paper introduces three key contributions: 1) a novel taxonomy classifying CVQE methods across architectural paradigms, coding standards, and compressed-domain feature utilization; 2) a unified benchmarking framework with modern compression protocols and standard test sequences; 3) systematic analysis of reconstruction performance vs. computational complexity trade-offs.

Result: The comprehensive review establishes a foundation for consistent assessment and informed model selection in CVQE research and deployment, highlighting promising directions for future research.

Conclusion: This survey addresses critical gaps in CVQE literature by providing systematic classification, fair benchmarking practices, and analysis of performance-complexity trade-offs, serving as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in video quality enhancement.

Abstract: Compressed video quality enhancement (CVQE) is crucial for improving user
experience with lossy video codecs like H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, and H.266/VVC.
While deep learning based CVQE has driven significant progress, existing
surveys still suffer from limitations: lack of systematic classification
linking methods to specific standards and artifacts, insufficient comparative
analysis of architectural paradigms across coding types, and underdeveloped
benchmarking practices. To address these gaps, this paper presents three key
contributions. First, it introduces a novel taxonomy classifying CVQE methods
across architectural paradigms, coding standards, and compressed-domain feature
utilization. Second, it proposes a unified benchmarking framework integrating
modern compression protocols and standard test sequences for fair
multi-criteria evaluation. Third, it provides a systematic analysis of the
critical trade-offs between reconstruction performance and computational
complexity observed in state-of-the-art methods and highlighting promising
directions for future research. This comprehensive review aims to establish a
foundation for consistent assessment and informed model selection in CVQE
research and deployment.

*Tao Han,Wanghan Xu,Junchao Gong,Xiaoyu Yue,Song Guo,Luping Zhou,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfGen is a new method that replaces VAE decoders with a one-step generator to enable arbitrary resolution image generation from fixed-size latents, reducing 4K generation time from over 100 seconds to under 10 seconds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models have quadratic computational complexity with resolution, making high-resolution generation (like 4K) slow and inefficient, taking over 100 seconds.

Method: Proposes InfGen which treats the fixed latent from diffusion models as content representation and uses a compact one-step generator to decode arbitrary resolution images, replacing the traditional VAE decoder.

Result: InfGen reduces 4K image generation time to under 10 seconds while maintaining quality, and can be applied to any model using the same latent space without retraining.

Conclusion: InfGen successfully enables efficient arbitrary resolution image generation with significantly reduced computational complexity, bringing many models into the high-resolution era.

Abstract: Arbitrary resolution image generation provides a consistent visual experience
across devices, having extensive applications for producers and consumers.
Current diffusion models increase computational demand quadratically with
resolution, causing 4K image generation delays over 100 seconds. To solve this,
we explore the second generation upon the latent diffusion models, where the
fixed latent generated by diffusion models is regarded as the content
representation and we propose to decode arbitrary resolution images with a
compact generated latent using a one-step generator. Thus, we present the
\textbf{InfGen}, replacing the VAE decoder with the new generator, for
generating images at any resolution from a fixed-size latent without retraining
the diffusion models, which simplifies the process, reducing computational
complexity and can be applied to any model using the same latent space.
Experiments show InfGen is capable of improving many models into the arbitrary
high-resolution era while cutting 4K image generation time to under 10 seconds.

*Emily Kaczmarek,Justin Szeto,Brennan Nichyporuk,Tal Arbel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised learning approach for Alzheimer's prediction using 3D brain MRI with temporal SSL methods outperforms supervised learning on most tasks and handles variable-length inputs and time intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for Alzheimer's prediction suffer from limited labeled data, poor generalization across datasets, and inability to handle varying numbers of input scans and time intervals between scans.

Method: Adapted three state-of-the-art temporal self-supervised learning approaches for 3D brain MRI analysis with novel extensions for variable-length inputs and robust spatial feature learning. Pre-trained on aggregated dataset of 3,161 patients from four public datasets.

Result: SSL model with temporal order prediction and contrastive learning outperformed supervised learning on 6 out of 7 downstream tasks including diagnosis classification, conversion detection, and future conversion prediction.

Conclusion: The SSL approach demonstrates superior adaptability and generalizability across tasks and varying input configurations, showing robust performance potential for clinical Alzheimer's applications.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that causes
memory loss and cognitive decline. While there has been extensive research in
applying deep learning models to Alzheimer's prediction tasks, these models
remain limited by lack of available labeled data, poor generalization across
datasets, and inflexibility to varying numbers of input scans and time
intervals between scans. In this study, we adapt three state-of-the-art
temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches for 3D brain MRI analysis,
and add novel extensions designed to handle variable-length inputs and learn
robust spatial features. We aggregate four publicly available datasets
comprising 3,161 patients for pre-training, and show the performance of our
model across multiple Alzheimer's prediction tasks including diagnosis
classification, conversion detection, and future conversion prediction.
Importantly, our SSL model implemented with temporal order prediction and
contrastive learning outperforms supervised learning on six out of seven
downstream tasks. It demonstrates adaptability and generalizability across
tasks and number of input images with varying time intervals, highlighting its
capacity for robust performance across clinical applications. We release our
code and model publicly at https://github.com/emilykaczmarek/SSL-AD.

### [65] [Structured Information Matters: Explainable ICD Coding with Patient-Level Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09699)
*Mingyang Li,Viktor Schlegel,Tingting Mu,Warren Del-Pinto,Goran Nenadic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes using document-level knowledge graphs to represent clinical documents for automated ICD coding, achieving 3.20% improvement in Macro-F1 scores while reducing text by 77% and retaining 90% information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual coding of clinical documents to standardized vocabularies like ICD is difficult and time-consuming. Automated coding can help but faces challenges with high-dimensional target spaces. External knowledge for input document representation has been underexplored.

Method: Compute structured representation of input documents using document-level knowledge graphs that provide comprehensive structured view of patient's condition. Integrate this graph representation into state-of-the-art PLM-ICD architecture for automated ICD-9 coding.

Result: Knowledge graph represents documents with 23% of original text while retaining 90% information. Achieves up to 3.20% improvement in Macro-F1 scores on benchmarks while improving training efficiency. Also demonstrates improved explainability over text-only baseline.

Conclusion: Using knowledge graphs for structured document representation significantly improves automated ICD coding performance, efficiency, and explainability by effectively capturing different entity types and relationships in clinical documents.

Abstract: Mapping clinical documents to standardised clinical vocabularies is an
important task, as it provides structured data for information retrieval and
analysis, which is essential to clinical research, hospital administration and
improving patient care. However, manual coding is both difficult and
time-consuming, making it impractical at scale. Automated coding can
potentially alleviate this burden, improving the availability and accuracy of
structured clinical data. The task is difficult to automate, as it requires
mapping to high-dimensional and long-tailed target spaces, such as the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD). While external knowledge
sources have been readily utilised to enhance output code representation, the
use of external resources for representing the input documents has been
underexplored. In this work, we compute a structured representation of the
input documents, making use of document-level knowledge graphs (KGs) that
provide a comprehensive structured view of a patient's condition. The resulting
knowledge graph efficiently represents the patient-centred input documents with
23\% of the original text while retaining 90\% of the information. We assess
the effectiveness of this graph for automated ICD-9 coding by integrating it
into the state-of-the-art ICD coding architecture PLM-ICD. Our experiments
yield improved Macro-F1 scores by up to 3.20\% on popular benchmarks, while
improving training efficiency. We attribute this improvement to different types
of entities and relationships in the KG, and demonstrate the improved
explainability potential of the approach over the text-only baseline.

*Malavika Suresh,Rahaf Aljundi,Ikechukwu Nkisi-Orji,Nirmalie Wiratunga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLAP is a novel activation probing technique that analyzes LLM activations across the entire residual stream to detect hallucinations, outperforming baselines and enabling fine-grained detection across different response samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models have reliability concerns due to their tendency to generate inaccurate text (hallucinations), requiring effective detection methods to improve trustworthiness.

Method: Cross-Layer Attention Probing (CLAP) processes LLM activations across the entire residual stream as a joint sequence for hallucination detection.

Result: CLAP improves hallucination detection compared to baselines across five LLMs and three tasks, works on both greedy and temperature-sampled responses, and maintains high reliability even out-of-distribution.

Conclusion: CLAP enables a detect-then-mitigate strategy that reduces hallucinations and improves LLM reliability more effectively than direct mitigation approaches.

Abstract: With the large-scale adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
applications, there is a growing reliability concern due to their tendency to
generate inaccurate text, i.e. hallucinations. In this work, we propose
Cross-Layer Attention Probing (CLAP), a novel activation probing technique for
hallucination detection, which processes the LLM activations across the entire
residual stream as a joint sequence. Our empirical evaluations using five LLMs
and three tasks show that CLAP improves hallucination detection compared to
baselines on both greedy decoded responses as well as responses sampled at
higher temperatures, thus enabling fine-grained detection, i.e. the ability to
disambiguate hallucinations and non-hallucinations among different sampled
responses to a given prompt. This allows us to propose a detect-then-mitigate
strategy using CLAP to reduce hallucinations and improve LLM reliability
compared to direct mitigation approaches. Finally, we show that CLAP maintains
high reliability even when applied out-of-distribution.

### [67] [Optimal Multi-Task Learning at Regularization Horizon for Speech Translation Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09701)
*JungHo Jung,Junhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a regularization perspective for multi-task learning in speech-to-text translation, introducing the concept of 'regularization horizon' that combines three regularization sources to achieve near state-of-the-art performance despite data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end speech-to-text translation suffers from limited paired speech-text data. The authors aim to overcome this by leveraging machine translation bitext data through multi-task learning, viewing it from a regularization perspective to improve model performance.

Method: The paper formulates multi-task learning as regularization and explores sequence regularization within and across modalities. It investigates consistency regularization (cross-modality), R-drop (same modality), and MT loss coefficient as three regularization sources, introducing the optimal 'regularization horizon' in high-dimensional space.

Result: Experiments on the MuST-C dataset demonstrate that tuning hyperparameters within the proposed regularization horizon achieves near state-of-the-art performance, effectively addressing the data scarcity problem in speech-to-text translation.

Conclusion: The regularization perspective provides an effective framework for multi-task learning in speech translation, with the regularization horizon concept enabling optimal performance by balancing multiple regularization sources across different modalities.

Abstract: End-to-end speech-to-text translation typically suffers from the scarcity of
paired speech-text data. One way to overcome this shortcoming is to utilize the
bitext data from the Machine Translation (MT) task and perform Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In this paper, we formulate MTL from a regularization
perspective and explore how sequences can be regularized within and across
modalities. By thoroughly investigating the effect of consistency
regularization (different modality) and R-drop (same modality), we show how
they respectively contribute to the total regularization. We also demonstrate
that the coefficient of MT loss serves as another source of regularization in
the MTL setting. With these three sources of regularization, we introduce the
optimal regularization contour in the high-dimensional space, called the
regularization horizon. Experiments show that tuning the hyperparameters within
the regularization horizon achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the
MuST-C dataset.

*Ninad Bhat,Kieran Browne,Pip Bingemann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Creativity Benchmark evaluates LLMs for marketing creativity across 100 brands and 3 prompt types, showing tightly clustered performance with no clear winner and highlighting limitations of automated evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate large language models' creative capabilities in marketing contexts, as traditional creativity tests don't fully transfer to brand-constrained tasks and automated evaluation methods are insufficient.

Method: Human pairwise preferences from 678 creatives on 11,012 comparisons analyzed with Bradley-Terry models, plus cosine distance analysis for model diversity and sensitivity to prompt reframing. Three LLM-as-judge setups were compared against human rankings.

Result: Models showed tightly clustered performance (Δθ ≈ 0.45, 61% win probability between top and bottom models) with no dominant model across brands or prompt types. LLM judges showed weak, inconsistent correlations with human rankings and judge-specific biases.

Conclusion: Expert human evaluation is essential for assessing marketing creativity in LLMs, automated judges cannot substitute humans, and diversity-aware workflows are needed due to the tight performance clustering and context-dependent model performance.

Abstract: We introduce Creativity Benchmark, an evaluation framework for large language
models (LLMs) in marketing creativity. The benchmark covers 100 brands (12
categories) and three prompt types (Insights, Ideas, Wild Ideas). Human
pairwise preferences from 678 practising creatives over 11,012 anonymised
comparisons, analysed with Bradley-Terry models, show tightly clustered
performance with no model dominating across brands or prompt types: the
top-bottom spread is $\Delta\theta \approx 0.45$, which implies a head-to-head
win probability of $0.61$; the highest-rated model beats the lowest only about
$61\%$ of the time. We also analyse model diversity using cosine distances to
capture intra- and inter-model variation and sensitivity to prompt reframing.
Comparing three LLM-as-judge setups with human rankings reveals weak,
inconsistent correlations and judge-specific biases, underscoring that
automated judges cannot substitute for human evaluation. Conventional
creativity tests also transfer only partially to brand-constrained tasks.
Overall, the results highlight the need for expert human evaluation and
diversity-aware workflows.

*Zhenhua Xu,Xixiang Zhao,Xubin Yue,Shengwei Tian,Changting Lin,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CTCC is a novel rule-driven fingerprinting framework for LLMs that encodes contextual correlations across multiple dialogue turns to provide stealthy and robust ownership verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns around intellectual property protection for LLMs as model theft and unauthorized redistribution become increasingly feasible, overcoming limitations of existing fingerprinting methods that face trade-offs between stealthness, robustness, and generalizability.

Method: Uses rule-driven contextual correlations across multiple dialogue turns (like counterfactual reasoning) instead of token-level or single-turn triggers, enabling black-box verification while mitigating false positives and fingerprint leakage.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures show CTCC consistently achieves stronger stealth and robustness than prior work, supporting continuous construction even if partial triggers are exposed.

Conclusion: CTCC provides a reliable and practical solution for ownership verification in real-world LLM deployment scenarios, outperforming existing methods in stealthiness and robustness.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) has intensified
concerns around intellectual property (IP) protection, as model theft and
unauthorized redistribution become increasingly feasible. To address this,
model fingerprinting aims to embed verifiable ownership traces into LLMs.
However, existing methods face inherent trade-offs between stealthness,
robustness, and generalizability, being either detectable via distributional
shifts, vulnerable to adversarial modifications, or easily invalidated once the
fingerprint is revealed. In this work, we introduce CTCC, a novel rule-driven
fingerprinting framework that encodes contextual correlations across multiple
dialogue turns, such as counterfactual, rather than relying on token-level or
single-turn triggers. CTCC enables fingerprint verification under black-box
access while mitigating false positives and fingerprint leakage, supporting
continuous construction under a shared semantic rule even if partial triggers
are exposed. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures
demonstrate that CTCC consistently achieves stronger stealth and robustness
than prior work. Our findings position CTCC as a reliable and practical
solution for ownership verification in real-world LLM deployment scenarios. Our
code and data are publicly available at <https://github.com/Xuzhenhua55/CTCC>.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models exhibit future vs present-oriented preferences in time-based choices, and these preferences can be systematically manipulated through different prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether language models display time-based preferences similar to humans in intertemporal choice scenarios, and to determine if these preferences can be manipulated through different prompting approaches.

Method: Adapted human experimental protocols to evaluate multiple LMs on time-tradeoff tasks, benchmarking against human decision makers. Introduced Manipulability of Time Orientation (MTO) metric to measure preference changes between future- and present-oriented prompts.

Result: Reasoning-focused models choose later options under future-oriented prompts but only partially personalize decisions across identities/geographies. Models that reason correctly about time orientation internalize future orientation for themselves as AI decision makers.

Conclusion: The findings have design implications for AI assistants needing to align with long-horizon goals, and outline a research agenda for personalized contextual calibration and socially aware deployment.

Abstract: We study whether language models (LMs) exhibit future- versus
present-oriented preferences in intertemporal choice and whether those
preferences can be systematically manipulated. Using adapted human experimental
protocols, we evaluate multiple LMs on time-tradeoff tasks and benchmark them
against a sample of human decision makers. We introduce an operational metric,
the Manipulability of Time Orientation (MTO), defined as the change in an LM's
revealed time preference between future- and present-oriented prompts. In our
tests, reasoning-focused models (e.g., DeepSeek-Reasoner and grok-3-mini)
choose later options under future-oriented prompts but only partially
personalize decisions across identities or geographies. Moreover, models that
correctly reason about time orientation internalize a future orientation for
themselves as AI decision makers. We discuss design implications for AI
assistants that should align with heterogeneous, long-horizon goals and outline
a research agenda on personalized contextual calibration and socially aware
deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study examines consistency of small LLMs (2B-8B parameters) in answering the same question multiple times, analyzing factors like temperature, model size, and finetuning, with results showing 50%-80% consistency for small models at low temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how consistently small language models answer the same question across multiple trials and investigate the trade-offs between consistency and accuracy.

Method: Analyzed open-source LLMs responding to 10 repetitions of questions from MMLU-Redux and MedQA benchmarks, varying inference temperatures, model sizes (small vs medium), and finetuning status, using new analytical and graphical tools.

Result: Small models show 50%-80% consistency at low temperatures, with accuracy among consistent answers correlating with overall accuracy. Medium-sized models demonstrate much higher consistency levels.

Conclusion: Answer consistency varies significantly among models but is generally achievable for small LLMs, with consistent answers maintaining reasonable accuracy correlation, while larger models show superior consistency performance.

Abstract: This work explores the consistency of small LLMs (2B-8B parameters) in
answering multiple times the same question. We present a study on known,
open-source LLMs responding to 10 repetitions of questions from the
multiple-choice benchmarks MMLU-Redux and MedQA, considering different
inference temperatures, small vs. medium models (50B-80B), finetuned vs. base
models, and other parameters. We also look into the effects of requiring
multi-trial answer consistency on accuracy and the trade-offs involved in
deciding which model best provides both of them. To support those studies, we
propose some new analytical and graphical tools. Results show that the number
of questions which can be answered consistently vary considerably among models
but are typically in the 50%-80% range for small models at low inference
temperatures. Also, accuracy among consistent answers seems to reasonably
correlate with overall accuracy. Results for medium-sized models seem to
indicate much higher levels of answer consistency.

*Nirmalendu Prakash,Yeo Wei Jie,Amir Abdullah,Ranjan Satapathy,Erik Cambria,Roy Ka Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers developed a method to identify specific features in LLMs that cause refusal of harmful prompts, using sparse autoencoders to find and manipulate critical features that can flip models from refusal to compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms behind safety behaviors in instruction-tuned LLMs, specifically why they refuse harmful prompts, as this behavior remains poorly understood despite its importance for AI safety.

Method: Used sparse autoencoders on residual-stream activations of Gemma-2-2B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-IT models. Developed a three-stage pipeline: (1) finding refusal-mediating directions, (2) greedy filtering to minimal feature sets, and (3) interaction discovery using factorization machines to capture nonlinear interactions.

Result: Successfully identified jailbreak-critical features that causally influence refusal behavior. Found evidence of redundant features that remain dormant unless earlier features are suppressed. Demonstrated ability to flip models from refusal to compliance by manipulating these features.

Conclusion: The approach enables fine-grained auditing and targeted intervention in safety behaviors by manipulating interpretable latent spaces, providing mechanistic insights into refusal behavior and potential vulnerabilities in LLM safety systems.

Abstract: Refusal on harmful prompts is a key safety behaviour in instruction-tuned
large language models (LLMs), yet the internal causes of this behaviour remain
poorly understood. We study two public instruction-tuned models, Gemma-2-2B-IT
and LLaMA-3.1-8B-IT, using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) trained on
residual-stream activations. Given a harmful prompt, we search the SAE latent
space for feature sets whose ablation flips the model from refusal to
compliance, demonstrating causal influence and creating a jailbreak. Our search
proceeds in three stages: (1) Refusal Direction: find a refusal-mediating
direction and collect SAE features near that direction; (2) Greedy Filtering:
prune to a minimal set; and (3) Interaction Discovery: fit a factorization
machine (FM) that captures nonlinear interactions among the remaining active
features and the minimal set. This pipeline yields a broad set of
jailbreak-critical features, offering insight into the mechanistic basis of
refusal. Moreover, we find evidence of redundant features that remain dormant
unless earlier features are suppressed. Our findings highlight the potential
for fine-grained auditing and targeted intervention in safety behaviours by
manipulating the interpretable latent space.

### [73] [Assisting Research Proposal Writing with Large Language Models: Evaluation and Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09709)
*Jing Ren,Weiqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes quantitative metrics for evaluating LLM-generated research proposals and an iterative prompting method to improve content quality and reference validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ethical concerns about incorrect/fabricated references in LLM-generated academic writing and provide objective evaluation instead of subjective human judgment.

Method: Two evaluation metrics (content quality and reference validity) plus iterative prompting based on these scores to enhance LLM writing performance.

Result: Metrics provide objective quantitative framework; iterative prompting significantly improves content quality while reducing reference inaccuracies and fabrications.

Conclusion: Proposed approach effectively addresses ethical challenges in academic writing by providing reliable quantitative evaluation and improving LLM output quality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are increasingly used in academic
writing, yet issues such as incorrect or fabricated references raise ethical
concerns. Moreover, current content quality evaluations often rely on
subjective human judgment, which is labor-intensive and lacks objectivity,
potentially compromising the consistency and reliability. In this study, to
provide a quantitative evaluation and enhance research proposal writing
capabilities of LLMs, we propose two key evaluation metrics--content quality
and reference validity--and an iterative prompting method based on the scores
derived from these two metrics. Our extensive experiments show that the
proposed metrics provide an objective, quantitative framework for assessing
ChatGPT's writing performance. Additionally, iterative prompting significantly
enhances content quality while reducing reference inaccuracies and
fabrications, addressing critical ethical challenges in academic contexts.

### [74] [Generating Individual Travel Diaries Using Large Language Models Informed by Census and Land-Use Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09710)
*Sepehr Golrokh Amin,Devin Rhoads,Fatemeh Fakhrmoosavi,Nicholas E. Lownes,John N. Ivan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based method generates synthetic travel diaries from open-source data, achieving comparable realism to traditional methods with better purpose prediction and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional travel diary generation relies on proprietary household surveys, which are costly and limited. This study aims to develop a more accessible approach using LLMs and open-source data.

Method: Generate personas from ACS and SLD data, synthesize diaries through LLM prompting, and validate using a novel one-to-cohort realism score with four metrics (Trip Count, Interval, Purpose, Mode) measured via Jensen-Shannon Divergence against real CSTS diaries.

Result: LLM-generated diaries achieve comparable overall realism (0.485 vs 0.455) to classical methods, excel in trip purpose determination, show greater consistency, and demonstrate statistical representativeness (0.612 vs 0.435) in aggregate validation.

Conclusion: LLMs show zero-shot viability for travel diary generation, establishing a quantifiable metric for synthetic diary evaluation while offering advantages in purpose prediction and consistency over traditional methods.

Abstract: This study introduces a Large Language Model (LLM) scheme for generating
individual travel diaries in agent-based transportation models. While
traditional approaches rely on large quantities of proprietary household travel
surveys, the method presented in this study generates personas stochastically
from open-source American Community Survey (ACS) and Smart Location Database
(SLD) data, then synthesizes diaries through direct prompting. This study
features a novel one-to-cohort realism score: a composite of four metrics (Trip
Count Score, Interval Score, Purpose Score, and Mode Score) validated against
the Connecticut Statewide Transportation Study (CSTS) diaries, matched across
demographic variables. The validation utilizes Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
measure distributional similarities between generated and real diaries. When
compared to diaries generated with classical methods (Negative Binomial for
trip generation; Multinomial Logit for mode/purpose) calibrated on the
validation set, LLM-generated diaries achieve comparable overall realism (LLM
mean: 0.485 vs. 0.455). The LLM excels in determining trip purpose and
demonstrates greater consistency (narrower realism score distribution), while
classical models lead in numerical estimates of trip count and activity
duration. Aggregate validation confirms the LLM's statistical
representativeness (LLM mean: 0.612 vs. 0.435), demonstrating LLM's zero-shot
viability and establishing a quantifiable metric of diary realism for future
synthetic diary evaluation systems.

*Aya E. Fouda,Abdelrahamn A. Hassan,Radwa J. Hanafy,Mohammed E. Fouda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PsychiatryBench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs in psychiatry using expert-validated textbook content, revealing significant gaps in clinical consistency and safety across 11 tasks and 5,300+ items.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM evaluation resources for psychiatry rely on limited clinical data, social media posts, or synthetic dialogues, which lack clinical validity and fail to capture the complexity of psychiatric reasoning.

Method: Created PsychiatryBench using authoritative psychiatric textbooks and casebooks, comprising 11 QA tasks including diagnostic reasoning, treatment planning, and longitudinal follow-up. Evaluated frontier LLMs using conventional metrics and LLM-as-judge similarity scoring.

Result: Substantial gaps in clinical consistency and safety were found, particularly in multi-turn follow-up and management tasks, highlighting the need for specialized model tuning.

Conclusion: PsychiatryBench provides a modular, extensible platform for benchmarking and improving LLM performance in high-stakes mental health applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise in enhancing psychiatric
practice, from improving diagnostic accuracy to streamlining clinical
documentation and therapeutic support. However, existing evaluation resources
heavily rely on small clinical interview corpora, social media posts, or
synthetic dialogues, which limits their clinical validity and fails to capture
the full complexity of psychiatric reasoning. In this work, we introduce
PsychiatryBench, a rigorously curated benchmark grounded exclusively in
authoritative, expert-validated psychiatric textbooks and casebooks.
PsychiatryBench comprises eleven distinct question-answering tasks ranging from
diagnostic reasoning and treatment planning to longitudinal follow-up,
management planning, clinical approach, sequential case analysis, and
multiple-choice/extended matching formats totaling over 5,300 expert-annotated
items. We evaluate a diverse set of frontier LLMs (including Google Gemini,
DeepSeek, LLaMA 3, and QWQ-32) alongside leading open-source medical models
(e.g., OpenBiloLLM, MedGemma) using both conventional metrics and an
"LLM-as-judge" similarity scoring framework. Our results reveal substantial
gaps in clinical consistency and safety, particularly in multi-turn follow-up
and management tasks, underscoring the need for specialized model tuning and
more robust evaluation paradigms. PsychiatryBench offers a modular, extensible
platform for benchmarking and improving LLM performance in high-stakes mental
health applications.

### [76] [The Thinking Therapist: Training Large Language Models to Deliver Acceptance and Commitment Therapy using Supervised Fine-Tuning and Odds Ratio Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09712)
*Talha Tahir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ORPO training significantly outperforms SFT and base models for ACT therapy delivery in small LLMs, with chain-of-thought reasoning benefiting SFT but not ORPO models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how different post-training methodologies (SFT vs ORPO) and explicit reasoning affect small LLMs' ability to deliver Acceptance and Commitment Therapy effectively.

Method: Trained Llama-3.2-3b-Instruct using synthetic ACT transcripts with SFT and ORPO approaches, each with/without chain-of-thought reasoning. Evaluated performance using ACT Fidelity Measure and Therapist Empathy Scale via LLM judge.

Result: ORPO-trained models significantly outperformed SFT and base models on both ACT fidelity and therapeutic empathy. COT helped SFT models (improved ACT-FM by 2.68 points) but provided no advantage to ORPO models.

Conclusion: ORPO is superior for teaching therapeutic process over content imitation in ACT delivery, and COT utility depends on the training paradigm, serving as scaffolding for imitation-based training.

Abstract: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a third-wave cognitive behavioral
therapy with emerging evidence of efficacy in several psychiatric conditions.
This study investigates the impact of post-training methodology and explicit
reasoning on the ability of a small open-weight large language model (LLM) to
deliver ACT. Using 50 sets of synthetic ACT transcripts generated by
Mistral-Large, we trained Llama-3.2-3b-Instruct with two distinct approaches,
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and odds ratio policy optimization (ORPO), each
with and without an explicit chain-of-thought (COT) reasoning step. Performance
was evaluated by comparing these four post-trained variants against the base
Instruct model. These models were benchmarked in simulated therapy sessions,
with performance quantitatively assessed on the ACT Fidelity Measure (ACT-FM)
and the Therapist Empathy Scale (TES) by an LLM judge that had been fine-tuned
on human evaluations. Our findings demonstrate that the ORPO-trained models
significantly outperformed both their SFT and Instruct counterparts on ACT
fidelity ($\chi^2(5) = 185.15, p < .001$) and therapeutic empathy ($\chi^2(5) =
140.37, p < .001$). The effect of COT was conditional as it provided a
significant benefit to SFT models, improving ACT-FM scores by an average of
2.68 points ($p < .001$), while offering no discernible advantage to the
superior ORPO or instruct-tuned variants. We posit that the superiority of ORPO
stems from its ability to learn the therapeutic `process' over imitating
`content,' a key aspect of ACT, while COT acts as a necessary scaffold for
models trained only via imitation. This study establishes that
preference-aligned policy optimization can effectively instill ACT competencies
in small LLMs, and that the utility of explicit reasoning is highly dependent
on the underlying training paradigm.

### [77] [HANRAG: Heuristic Accurate Noise-resistant Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Multi-hop Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09713)
*Duolin Sun,Dan Yang,Yue Shen,Yihan Jiao,Zhehao Tan,Jie Feng,Lianzhen Zhong,Jian Wang,Peng Wei,Jinjie Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HANRAG is a heuristic-based framework that improves RAG systems by routing queries, decomposing complex queries into sub-queries, and filtering noise from retrieved documents to handle multi-hop question answering more efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods struggle with multi-hop queries due to over-reliance on iterative retrieval, failure to capture relevant sub-query content, and noise accumulation problems in retrieved documents.

Method: Proposes HANRAG framework that uses a powerful revelator to route queries, decompose them into sub-queries, and filter noise from retrieved documents to enhance adaptability and noise resistance.

Result: Superior performance compared to leading industry methods across various benchmarks, achieving better results in both single-hop and multi-hop question-answering tasks.

Conclusion: HANRAG effectively addresses the limitations of current RAG approaches by providing an efficient framework for handling queries of varying complexity with improved noise management and retrieval efficiency.

Abstract: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach enhances question-answering
systems and dialogue generation tasks by integrating information retrieval (IR)
technologies with large language models (LLMs). This strategy, which retrieves
information from external knowledge bases to bolster the response capabilities
of generative models, has achieved certain successes. However, current RAG
methods still face numerous challenges when dealing with multi-hop queries. For
instance, some approaches overly rely on iterative retrieval, wasting too many
retrieval steps on compound queries. Additionally, using the original complex
query for retrieval may fail to capture content relevant to specific
sub-queries, resulting in noisy retrieved content. If the noise is not managed,
it can lead to the problem of noise accumulation. To address these issues, we
introduce HANRAG, a novel heuristic-based framework designed to efficiently
tackle problems of varying complexity. Driven by a powerful revelator, HANRAG
routes queries, decomposes them into sub-queries, and filters noise from
retrieved documents. This enhances the system's adaptability and noise
resistance, making it highly capable of handling diverse queries. We compare
the proposed framework against other leading industry methods across various
benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our framework obtains superior
performance in both single-hop and multi-hop question-answering tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study evaluates 18 semantic similarity measurement methods for software engineering tasks, revealing significant flaws in commonly used metrics and showing LLM-based approaches outperform embedding methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether current semantic similarity methods truly understand semantic relationships or just recognize surface patterns, which is crucial for software engineering applications like code search and refactoring tools.

Method: Created systematic testing framework with controlled text/code changes, tested 18 approaches including word-based methods, embedding techniques, LLM-based systems, and structure-aware algorithms.

Result: Embedding methods incorrectly identified semantic opposites as similar up to 99.9% of time, switching from Euclidean to cosine similarity improved results by 24-66%. LLM-based approaches performed better with low similarity scores (0.00-0.29) for different meanings vs embedding methods' incorrect high scores (0.82-0.99).

Conclusion: Current semantic similarity metrics have significant flaws, with embedding methods particularly problematic. LLM-based approaches show better performance but careful metric selection (cosine over Euclidean) can substantially improve results.

Abstract: This research examines how well different methods measure semantic
similarity, which is important for various software engineering applications
such as code search, API recommendations, automated code reviews, and
refactoring tools. While large language models are increasingly used for these
similarity assessments, questions remain about whether they truly understand
semantic relationships or merely recognize surface patterns.
  The study tested 18 different similarity measurement approaches, including
word-based methods, embedding techniques, LLM-based systems, and
structure-aware algorithms. The researchers created a systematic testing
framework that applies controlled changes to text and code to evaluate how well
each method handles different types of semantic relationships.
  The results revealed significant issues with commonly used metrics. Some
embedding-based methods incorrectly identified semantic opposites as similar up
to 99.9 percent of the time, while certain transformer-based approaches
occasionally rated opposite meanings as more similar than synonymous ones. The
study found that embedding methods' poor performance often stemmed from how
they calculate distances; switching from Euclidean distance to cosine
similarity improved results by 24 to 66 percent. LLM-based approaches performed
better at distinguishing semantic differences, producing low similarity scores
(0.00 to 0.29) for genuinely different meanings, compared to embedding methods
that incorrectly assigned high scores (0.82 to 0.99) to dissimilar content.

*Naveen Lamba,Sanju Tiwari,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies and characterizes key symbolic properties that make LLMs intrinsically vulnerable to hallucinations, showing that modifiers and named entities cause persistent hallucination issues across model scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While hallucination in LLMs is well-studied, the specific properties that make them intrinsically vulnerable to hallucinations have not been identified and characterized. The research aims to pinpoint vulnerabilities within the model's internal mechanisms.

Method: Used HaluEval and TruthfulQA datasets, converting their question-answering format into various formats to identify symbolic properties causing hallucinations. Tested across Gemma-2 models of different sizes (2B, 9B, 27B).

Result: Hallucination percentages were high across symbolic properties: 79.0% for Gemma-2-2B, dropping to 73.6% for 9B and 63.9% for 27B. Modifiers (84.76%-94.98%) and named entities (83.87%-93.96%) showed particularly high hallucination rates across all models and datasets.

Conclusion: Symbolic elements continue to confuse LLMs regardless of scale, indicating a fundamental weakness in how these models process such inputs. While larger models reduce hallucination rates, substantial hallucination caused by symbolic properties persists.

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a well studied problem.
However, the properties that make LLM intrinsically vulnerable to
hallucinations have not been identified and studied. This research identifies
and characterizes the key properties, allowing us to pinpoint vulnerabilities
within the model's internal mechanisms. To solidify on these properties, we
utilized two established datasets, HaluEval and TruthfulQA and convert their
existing format of question answering into various other formats to narrow down
these properties as the reason for the hallucinations. Our findings reveal that
hallucination percentages across symbolic properties are notably high for
Gemma-2-2B, averaging 79.0% across tasks and datasets. With increased model
scale, hallucination drops to 73.6% for Gemma-2-9B and 63.9% for Gemma-2-27B,
reflecting a 15 percentage point reduction overall. Although the hallucination
rate decreases as the model size increases, a substantial amount of
hallucination caused by symbolic properties still persists. This is especially
evident for modifiers (ranging from 84.76% to 94.98%) and named entities
(ranging from 83.87% to 93.96%) across all Gemma models and both datasets.
These findings indicate that symbolic elements continue to confuse the models,
pointing to a fundamental weakness in how these LLMs process such
inputs--regardless of their scale.

TL;DR: ALIGNS is a large language model-based system that generates comprehensive nomological networks to address the long-standing challenge of building theoretical maps for measurement validation in psychology and related fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building nomological networks has remained a challenge for 70 years since Cronbach and Meehl proposed them as fundamental to validation, with practical consequences including failed clinical trials and misguided public policy targeting wrong outcomes.

Method: Analysis of Latent Indicators to Generate Nomological Structures (ALIGNS) uses large language models trained with validated questionnaire measures to create comprehensive nomological networks containing over 550,000 indicators across multiple fields.

Result: ALIGNS successfully generated three nomological networks, demonstrated classification accuracy, revealed that NIH PROMIS anxiety and depression instruments converge into emotional distress, identified four new child temperament dimensions, and received positive expert psychometrician assessments.

Conclusion: ALIGNS represents the first application of large language models to solve foundational measurement validation problems, complementing traditional methods with large-scale nomological analysis and making the system freely available for research use.

Abstract: Psychological measurement is critical to many disciplines. Despite advances
in measurement, building nomological networks, theoretical maps of how concepts
and measures relate to establish validity, remains a challenge 70 years after
Cronbach and Meehl proposed them as fundamental to validation. This limitation
has practical consequences: clinical trials may fail to detect treatment
effects, and public policy may target the wrong outcomes. We introduce Analysis
of Latent Indicators to Generate Nomological Structures (ALIGNS), a large
language model-based system trained with validated questionnaire measures.
ALIGNS provides three comprehensive nomological networks containing over
550,000 indicators across psychology, medicine, social policy, and other
fields. This represents the first application of large language models to solve
a foundational problem in measurement validation. We report classification
accuracy tests used to develop the model, as well as three evaluations. In the
first evaluation, the widely used NIH PROMIS anxiety and depression instruments
are shown to converge into a single dimension of emotional distress. The second
evaluation examines child temperament measures and identifies four potential
dimensions not captured by current frameworks, and questions one existing
dimension. The third evaluation, an applicability check, engages expert
psychometricians who assess the system's importance, accessibility, and
suitability. ALIGNS is freely available at nomologicalnetwork.org,
complementing traditional validation methods with large-scale nomological

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Technology opportunities are crucial for advancement but challenging to identify systematically. The paper aims to develop a structured approach to detect emerging tech trends from patent data.

Method: Extracts text from patents, maps text-based topics to discover inter-technology relationships, tracks topic changes over time using large language models and chat-based prompts for opportunity discovery.

Result: Framework successfully identified that AI technology is evolving toward forms that facilitate everyday accessibility when tested on USPTO AI patent dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates effective potential for identifying future technology opportunities through temporal patent analysis enhanced by language models.

Abstract: Technology opportunities are critical information that serve as a foundation
for advancements in technology, industry, and innovation. This paper proposes a
framework based on the temporal relationships between technologies to identify
emerging technology opportunities. The proposed framework begins by extracting
text from a patent dataset, followed by mapping text-based topics to discover
inter-technology relationships. Technology opportunities are then identified by
tracking changes in these topics over time. To enhance efficiency, the
framework leverages a large language model to extract topics and employs a
prompt for a chat-based language model to support the discovery of technology
opportunities. The framework was evaluated using an artificial intelligence
patent dataset provided by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The
experimental results suggest that artificial intelligence technology is
evolving into forms that facilitate everyday accessibility. This approach
demonstrates the potential of the proposed framework to identify future
technology opportunities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in biomedical EL benchmarks that typically focus on English-only corpora with flat mentions, ignoring the realistic scenarios of nested and multilingual mentions.

Method: Two-stage retrieval-ranking using the same base encoder (original pre-trained for retrieval, domain-fine-tuned for ranking), boundary cues with learnable [Ms]/[Me] tags for span identification, and dataset augmentation with three complementary data sources.

Result: Ranked third in the multilingual track of BioNNE 2025 leaderboard, demonstrating effectiveness and competitiveness of the minimal modifications.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight pipeline with principled modifications effectively handles multilingual biomedical nested entity linking while keeping the original EL model intact, showing strong performance with minimal changes.

Abstract: Entity linking (EL) for biomedical text is typically benchmarked on
English-only corpora with flat mentions, leaving the more realistic scenario of
nested and multilingual mentions largely unexplored. We present our system for
the BioNNE 2025 Multilingual Biomedical Nested Named Entity Linking shared task
(English & Russian), closing this gap with a lightweight pipeline that keeps
the original EL model intact and modifies only three task-aligned components:
Two-stage retrieval-ranking. We leverage the same base encoder model in both
stages: the retrieval stage uses the original pre-trained model, while the
ranking stage applies domain-specific fine-tuning. Boundary cues. In the
ranking stage, we wrap each mention with learnable [Ms] / [Me] tags, providing
the encoder with an explicit, language-agnostic span before robustness to
overlap and nesting. Dataset augmentation. We also automatically expand the
ranking training corpus with three complementary data sources, enhancing
coverage without extra manual annotation. On the BioNNE 2025 leaderboard, our
two stage system, bilingual bert (BIBERT-Pipe), ranks third in the multilingual

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs fail to capture the nuanced reasoning required for financial problem-solving, which demands multistep quantitative reasoning, domain-specific terminology, and real-world scenario comprehension.

Method: Multi-agent framework with three components: Base Generator, Evidence Retriever, and Expert Reviewer working in single-pass iteration. Uses RAG from 6 finance textbooks and domain-expert prompting strategies.

Result: Critique-based refinement improves answer accuracy by 6.6-8.3% over zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines. Gemini-2.0-Flash achieved highest performance. GPT-4o-mini matched finance-tuned FinGPT-mt_Llama3-8B_LoRA.

Conclusion: The framework provides a cost-effective approach to enhancing financial QA and offers insights for further research in multi-agent financial LLM systems.

Abstract: Question answering (QA) plays a central role in financial education, yet
existing large language model (LLM) approaches often fail to capture the
nuanced and specialized reasoning required for financial problem-solving. The
financial domain demands multistep quantitative reasoning, familiarity with
domain-specific terminology, and comprehension of real-world scenarios. We
present a multi-agent framework that leverages role-based prompting to enhance
performance on domain-specific QA. Our framework comprises a Base Generator, an
Evidence Retriever, and an Expert Reviewer agent that work in a single-pass
iteration to produce a refined answer. We evaluated our framework on a set of
3,532 expert-designed finance education questions from Study.com, an online
learning platform. We leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for
contextual evidence from 6 finance textbooks and prompting strategies for a
domain-expert reviewer. Our experiments indicate that critique-based refinement
improves answer accuracy by 6.6-8.3% over zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines,
with the highest performance from Gemini-2.0-Flash. Furthermore, our method
enables GPT-4o-mini to achieve performance comparable to the finance-tuned
FinGPT-mt_Llama3-8B_LoRA. Our results show a cost-effective approach to
enhancing financial QA and offer insights for further research in multi-agent
financial LLM systems.

TL;DR: Meta-analysis of 195 trials from 20 studies shows ML models achieve 80% average accuracy in Twitter sentiment analysis, but highlights issues with accuracy as a metric and calls for standardized reporting practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate ML performance in Twitter sentiment analysis, estimate average performance, assess study heterogeneity, and analyze how study characteristics influence model performance across different research.

Method: Used PRISMA guidelines to search academic databases, selected 195 trials from 20 studies with 12 features. Analyzed overall accuracy using double arcsine transformation and three-level random effects model with AIC optimization.

Result: Average overall accuracy of AIC-optimized model was 0.80 [0.76, 0.84]. Found that overall accuracy is misleading due to sensitivity to class imbalance and number of sentiment classes.

Conclusion: Overall accuracy is problematic for comparisons, requires normalization. Standardized reporting including confusion matrices for independent test sets is essential for reliable ML classifier comparisons across studies.

Abstract: This paper presents a meta-analysis evaluating ML performance in sentiment
analysis for Twitter data. The study aims to estimate the average performance,
assess heterogeneity between and within studies, and analyze how study
characteristics influence model performance. Using PRISMA guidelines, we
searched academic databases and selected 195 trials from 20 studies with 12
study features. Overall accuracy, the most reported performance metric, was
analyzed using double arcsine transformation and a three-level random effects
model. The average overall accuracy of the AIC-optimized model was 0.80 [0.76,
0.84]. This paper provides two key insights: 1) Overall accuracy is widely used
but often misleading due to its sensitivity to class imbalance and the number
of sentiment classes, highlighting the need for normalization. 2) Standardized
reporting of model performance, including reporting confusion matrices for
independent test sets, is essential for reliable comparisons of ML classifiers
across studies, which seems far from common practice.

*Gerard Sant,Zifan Jiang,Carlos Escolano,Amit Moryossef,Mathias Müller,Rico Sennrich,Sarah Ebling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultimodalHugs is a framework built on Hugging Face that enables diverse multimodal data processing, particularly for sign language, addressing reproducibility and flexibility issues in SLP research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sign language processing research faces challenges with complex ad-hoc code, low reproducibility, and unfair comparisons. Existing tools like Hugging Face lack flexibility for sign language experiments.

Method: Built MultimodalHugs framework on top of Hugging Face to support diverse data modalities and tasks, adding an abstraction layer for non-standard use cases.

Result: The framework successfully accommodates diverse modalities including pose estimation data for sign languages and pixel data for text characters, as shown in quantitative experiments.

Conclusion: MultimodalHugs provides a solution for more reproducible and flexible sign language processing research while being applicable to other multimodal use cases beyond standard Hugging Face templates.

Abstract: In recent years, sign language processing (SLP) has gained importance in the
general field of Natural Language Processing. However, compared to research on
spoken languages, SLP research is hindered by complex ad-hoc code,
inadvertently leading to low reproducibility and unfair comparisons. Existing
tools that are built for fast and reproducible experimentation, such as Hugging
Face, are not flexible enough to seamlessly integrate sign language
experiments. This view is confirmed by a survey we conducted among SLP
researchers.
  To address these challenges, we introduce MultimodalHugs, a framework built
on top of Hugging Face that enables more diverse data modalities and tasks,
while inheriting the well-known advantages of the Hugging Face ecosystem. Even
though sign languages are our primary focus, MultimodalHugs adds a layer of
abstraction that makes it more widely applicable to other use cases that do not
fit one of the standard templates of Hugging Face. We provide quantitative
experiments to illustrate how MultimodalHugs can accommodate diverse modalities
such as pose estimation data for sign languages, or pixel data for text
characters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AncientDoc is the first benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models on Chinese ancient documents, featuring 5 tasks across 14 document types with 3,000 pages to assess capabilities from OCR to knowledge reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chinese ancient documents contain rich historical knowledge but face digitization challenges. Current VLMs struggle with their visual and linguistic complexity, and existing benchmarks focus only on English or simplified Chinese, leaving a gap for ancient Chinese document evaluation.

Method: Created AncientDoc benchmark with five tasks: page-level OCR, vernacular translation, reasoning-based QA, knowledge-based QA, and linguistic variant QA. Covers 14 document types, over 100 books, and about 3,000 pages. Evaluated mainstream VLMs using multiple metrics with human-aligned LLM scoring.

Result: The paper presents the AncientDoc benchmark but does not specify the actual evaluation results of the tested VLMs in this abstract.

Conclusion: AncientDoc fills a critical gap by providing the first comprehensive benchmark for assessing VLMs on Chinese ancient documents, enabling better evaluation of models' capabilities in handling complex visual and linguistic features of historical texts.

Abstract: Chinese ancient documents, invaluable carriers of millennia of Chinese
history and culture, hold rich knowledge across diverse fields but face
challenges in digitization and understanding, i.e., traditional methods only
scan images, while current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with their
visual and linguistic complexity. Existing document benchmarks focus on English
printed texts or simplified Chinese, leaving a gap for evaluating VLMs on
ancient Chinese documents. To address this, we present AncientDoc, the first
benchmark for Chinese ancient documents, designed to assess VLMs from OCR to
knowledge reasoning. AncientDoc includes five tasks (page-level OCR, vernacular
translation, reasoning-based QA, knowledge-based QA, linguistic variant QA) and
covers 14 document types, over 100 books, and about 3,000 pages. Based on
AncientDoc, we evaluate mainstream VLMs using multiple metrics, supplemented by
a human-aligned large language model for scoring.

*Zikang Guo,Benfeng Xu,Chiwei Zhu,Wentao Hong,Xiaorui Wang,Zhendong Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MCP-AgentBench is a new benchmark designed to evaluate language agent capabilities in MCP-mediated tool interactions, addressing the gap in existing benchmarks that fail to capture real-world agent performance in the emerging Model Context Protocol standard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to properly assess agent performance in the new MCP paradigm, leading to distorted perceptions of agent capabilities and inability to reliably differentiate proficiencies in real-world tool interactions.

Method: Developed a comprehensive benchmark with: 1) 33 operational MCP servers with 188 distinct tools, 2) 600 systematically designed queries across 6 categories of varying complexity, and 3) MCP-Eval, a novel outcome-oriented evaluation methodology prioritizing task success.

Result: The benchmark provides foundational insights through extensive empirical evaluation of leading language agents, enabling reliable assessment of agent capabilities in MCP-mediated environments.

Conclusion: MCP-AgentBench provides a standardized framework for building, validating, and advancing agents that can fully leverage MCP's benefits, accelerating progress toward capable and interoperable AI systems.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is rapidly emerging as a pivotal open
standard, designed to enhance agent-tool integration and interoperability, and
is positioned to unlock a new era of powerful, interconnected, and genuinely
utilitarian agentic AI. However, despite MCP's growing adoption, existing
benchmarks often fail to capture real-world agent performance within this new
paradigm, leading to a distorted perception of their true operational value and
an inability to reliably differentiate proficiencies. To bridge this critical
evaluation gap, we introduce MCP-AgentBench -- a comprehensive benchmark
specifically engineered to rigorously assess language agent capabilities in
MCP-mediated tool interactions. Core contributions of MCP-AgentBench include:
the establishment of a robust MCP testbed comprising 33 operational servers
with 188 distinct tools; the development of a benchmark featuring 600
systematically designed queries distributed across 6 distinct categories of
varying interaction complexity; and the introduction of MCP-Eval, a novel
outcome-oriented evaluation methodology prioritizing real-world task success.
Through extensive empirical evaluation of leading language agents, we provide
foundational insights. MCP-AgentBench aims to equip the research community with
a standardized and reliable framework to build, validate, and advance agents
capable of fully leveraging MCP's transformative benefits, thereby accelerating
progress toward truly capable and interoperable AI systems.

### [89] [Discrimination by LLMs: Cross-lingual Bias Assessment and Mitigation in Decision-Making and Summarisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09735)
*Willem Huijzer,Jieying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show significant biases in decision-making tasks favoring female gender, younger ages, and African-American backgrounds, while summarization tasks show minimal bias. Cross-lingual analysis reveals similar bias patterns between English and Dutch. Prompt-based mitigation strategies can reduce biases by up to 27%, with newer models like GPT-4o showing better response to mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine biases in LLMs related to background, gender, and age, and their impact on decision-making and summarization tasks, including cross-lingual propagation and effectiveness of mitigation strategies.

Method: Used an adapted dataset translated into Dutch, creating 151,200 prompts for decision tasks and 176,400 for summarization tasks. Tested various demographic variables, instructions, salience levels, and languages on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o.

Result: Both models showed significant bias in decision-making (favoring female gender, younger ages, African-American background). Summarization showed minimal bias except for age-related differences in GPT-3.5. Cross-lingual patterns were similar but with category-specific differences. Mitigation instructions reduced bias gaps by up to 27%. GPT-4o showed reduced biases compared to GPT-3.5.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit concerning biases requiring cautious adoption and context-specific testing. Prompt-based mitigation shows promise, especially in newer models, highlighting the need for continued development of effective bias reduction strategies for responsible AI deployment.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into various domains
raises concerns about societal inequalities and information bias. This study
examines biases in LLMs related to background, gender, and age, with a focus on
their impact on decision-making and summarization tasks. Additionally, the
research examines the cross-lingual propagation of these biases and evaluates
the effectiveness of prompt-instructed mitigation strategies. Using an adapted
version of the dataset by Tamkin et al. (2023) translated into Dutch, we
created 151,200 unique prompts for the decision task and 176,400 for the
summarisation task. Various demographic variables, instructions, salience
levels, and languages were tested on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o. Our analysis revealed
that both models were significantly biased during decision-making, favouring
female gender, younger ages, and certain backgrounds such as the
African-American background. In contrast, the summarisation task showed minimal
evidence of bias, though significant age-related differences emerged for
GPT-3.5 in English. Cross-lingual analysis showed that bias patterns were
broadly similar between English and Dutch, though notable differences were
observed across specific demographic categories. The newly proposed mitigation
instructions, while unable to eliminate biases completely, demonstrated
potential in reducing them. The most effective instruction achieved a 27\% mean
reduction in the gap between the most and least favorable demographics.
Notably, contrary to GPT-3.5, GPT-4o displayed reduced biases for all prompts
in English, indicating the specific potential for prompt-based mitigation
within newer models. This research underscores the importance of cautious
adoption of LLMs and context-specific bias testing, highlighting the need for
continued development of effective mitigation strategies to ensure responsible
deployment of AI.

### [90] [HEFT: A Coarse-to-Fine Hierarchy for Enhancing the Efficiency and Accuracy of Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09801)
*Brennen Hill*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HEFT combines LoRA (weight space) and ReFT (representation space) PEFT methods in a hierarchical coarse-to-fine approach, achieving superior performance on BoolQ benchmark with only 3 epochs vs 20 epochs for single methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational constraints in adapting LLMs to specialized reasoning tasks by synergistically combining different PEFT paradigms for better efficiency and performance.

Method: Hierarchical Efficient Fine-Tuning (HEFT) that first applies broad adaptation using LoRA in weight space, followed by precise refinement using Representation Fine-Tuning (ReFT) on internal activations.

Result: 85.17% accuracy on BoolQ benchmark with only 3 epochs, outperforming LoRA-only (85.05%) and ReFT-only (83.36%) methods that required 20 epochs.

Conclusion: Thoughtful composition of PEFT methods offers a more efficient and effective path for advancing LLM reasoning capabilities, achieving superior results with significantly reduced computational budget.

Abstract: The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to specialized reasoning tasks
is fundamentally constrained by computational resources. Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a powerful solution, yet the
landscape of these techniques is diverse, with distinct methods operating in
either the model's weight space or its representation space. This paper
investigates the hypothesis that a synergistic combination of these paradigms
can unlock superior performance and efficiency. We introduce HEFT (Hierarchical
Efficient Fine-Tuning), a novel hierarchical adaptation strategy that composes
two distinct PEFT methods in a coarse-to-fine manner: first, a broad,
foundational adaptation in the weight space using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
followed by a precise, surgical refinement of internal activations using
Representation Fine-Tuning (ReFT). We evaluate this approach by fine-tuning a
Llama-2-7B model on the BoolQ benchmark, a challenging dataset for inferential
reasoning. Our results reveal a profound synergistic effect. A model fine-tuned
for only three epochs with our HEFT strategy achieves an accuracy of 85.17\%,
exceeding the performance of models trained for 20 epochs with either LoRA-only
(85.05\%) or ReFT-only (83.36\%) methodologies. This work demonstrates that the
thoughtful composition of PEFT methods is a potent algorithmic innovation,
offering a more efficient and effective path toward advancing the reasoning
capabilities of language models. By achieving superior results with a fraction
of the computational budget, our findings present a principled approach to
overcoming the obstacles inherent in adapting large-scale models for complex
cognitive tasks.

*Helen de Andrade Abreu,Tiago Timponi Torrent,Ely Edison da Silva Matos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for modeling multimodal conversational turn organization through correlations between language and interactive gestures, with evidence from enriched annotation of pragmatic frames in a Brazilian TV series dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in machine learning datasets by encoding specific strategies and gestures used for conversational turn organization, which had not been systematically documented previously.

Method: Developed an annotation methodology to enrich the Frame2 dataset (Brazilian TV series episodes) with pragmatic frames modeling turn organization, specifically analyzing interactive gestures used for passing, taking, and keeping conversational turns.

Result: Confirmed that communicators use gestures as tools for turn management in face-to-face conversations and discovered previously undocumented gesture variations. Showed that pragmatic frame annotation provides deeper understanding of human cognition and language.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that gestures arise from conceptualization of pragmatic frames involving mental spaces, blending and conceptual metaphors, and that multimodal annotation contributes significantly to understanding conversational organization and human cognition.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for modeling multimodal conversational turn
organization via the proposition of correlations between language and
interactive gestures, based on analysis as to how pragmatic frames are
conceptualized and evoked by communicators. As a means to provide evidence for
the analysis, we developed an annotation methodology to enrich a multimodal
dataset (annotated for semantic frames) with pragmatic frames modeling
conversational turn organization. Although conversational turn organization has
been studied by researchers from diverse fields, the specific strategies,
especially gestures used by communicators, had not yet been encoded in a
dataset that can be used for machine learning. To fill this gap, we enriched
the Frame2 dataset with annotations of gestures used for turn organization. The
Frame2 dataset features 10 episodes from the Brazilian TV series Pedro Pelo
Mundo annotated for semantic frames evoked in both video and text. This dataset
allowed us to closely observe how communicators use interactive gestures
outside a laboratory, in settings, to our knowledge, not previously recorded in
related literature. Our results have confirmed that communicators involved in
face-to-face conversation make use of gestures as a tool for passing, taking
and keeping conversational turns, and also revealed variations of some gestures
that had not been documented before. We propose that the use of these gestures
arises from the conceptualization of pragmatic frames, involving mental spaces,
blending and conceptual metaphors. In addition, our data demonstrate that the
annotation of pragmatic frames contributes to a deeper understanding of human
cognition and language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Topic-guided reinforcement learning approach improves content selection in multi-document summarization by using topic rewards to enhance summary informativeness and alignment with source documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models perform well on single-document summarization but have room for improvement in Multi-Document Summarization (MDS), particularly in effectively integrating information from multiple sources while maintaining coherence and topical relevance.

Method: Propose a topic-guided reinforcement learning approach using explicit topic labels as prompts and a novel topic reward within the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework to measure topic alignment between generated summaries and source documents.

Result: Experimental results on Multi-News and Multi-XScience datasets show the method consistently outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating improved performance in multi-document summarization.

Conclusion: Leveraging topical cues through reinforcement learning is an effective approach for enhancing content selection and overall performance in multi-document summarization tasks.

Abstract: A key challenge in Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) is effectively
integrating information from multiple sources while maintaining coherence and
topical relevance. While Large Language Models have shown impressive results in
single-document summarization, their performance on MDS still leaves room for
improvement. In this paper, we propose a topic-guided reinforcement learning
approach to improve content selection in MDS. We first show that explicitly
prompting models with topic labels enhances the informativeness of the
generated summaries. Building on this insight, we propose a novel topic reward
within the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework to measure topic
alignment between the generated summary and source documents. Experimental
results on the Multi-News and Multi-XScience datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the
effectiveness of leveraging topical cues in MDS.

*Bastián González-Bustamante,Nando Verelst,Carla Cisternas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can generate synthetic survey responses that approximate human responses from probabilistic samples, with excellent performance on trust items and comparable results across top models like GPT-4o and Llama 4 Maverick, though performance varies by item and demographic factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLM-generated synthetic survey responses can reliably emulate human answers and behavior while mitigating measurement and representation errors in survey research, while assessing potential biases inherited from training data.

Method: Benchmarked 128 prompt-model-question triplets generating 189,696 synthetic profiles, compared against ground-truth human responses from a Chilean public opinion probabilistic survey, using meta-analysis across 128 question-subsample pairs with performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

Result: Synthetic responses achieved excellent performance on trust items (F1-score and accuracy > 0.90), GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini and Llama 4 Maverick performed comparably, and synthetic-human alignment was highest among respondents aged 45-59, though with substantial item-level heterogeneity.

Conclusion: LLM-based synthetic samples can approximate probabilistic sample responses but require careful calibration and additional distributional tests to ensure algorithmic fidelity and reduce errors, as capturing full public opinion nuance remains challenging.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues for methodological and
applied innovations in survey research by using synthetic respondents to
emulate human answers and behaviour, potentially mitigating measurement and
representation errors. However, the extent to which LLMs recover aggregate item
distributions remains uncertain and downstream applications risk reproducing
social stereotypes and biases inherited from training data. We evaluate the
reliability of LLM-generated synthetic survey responses against ground-truth
human responses from a Chilean public opinion probabilistic survey.
Specifically, we benchmark 128 prompt-model-question triplets, generating
189,696 synthetic profiles, and pool performance metrics (i.e., accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-score) in a meta-analysis across 128
question-subsample pairs to test for biases along key sociodemographic
dimensions. The evaluation spans OpenAI's GPT family and o-series reasoning
models, as well as Llama and Qwen checkpoints. Three results stand out. First,
synthetic responses achieve excellent performance on trust items (F1-score and
accuracy > 0.90). Second, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini and Llama 4 Maverick perform
comparably on this task. Third, synthetic-human alignment is highest among
respondents aged 45-59. Overall, LLM-based synthetic samples approximate
responses from a probabilistic sample, though with substantial item-level
heterogeneity. Capturing the full nuance of public opinion remains challenging
and requires careful calibration and additional distributional tests to ensure
algorithmic fidelity and reduce errors.

Conclusion: The CMHG dataset serves as a valuable resource to advance headline generation in Chinese minority languages and contribute to development of related benchmarks in this domain.

Abstract: Minority languages in China, such as Tibetan, Uyghur, and Traditional
Mongolian, face significant challenges due to their unique writing systems,
which differ from international standards. This discrepancy has led to a severe

*Ponhvoan Srey,Xiaobao Wu,Anh Tuan Luu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IRIS is an unsupervised hallucination detection framework that uses LLM's internal representations and response uncertainty as features and soft pseudolabels for detecting factual errors without labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised hallucination detection methods rely on proxy signals unrelated to factual correctness, limiting generalizability across datasets and scenarios.

Method: IRIS prompts LLMs to verify statement truthfulness, extracts contextualized embeddings as features, and uses response uncertainty as soft pseudolabels for training.

Result: IRIS consistently outperforms existing unsupervised methods, is computationally low cost, works with few training data, and suitable for real-time detection.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages LLM's internal representations intrinsic to factual correctness for unsupervised hallucination detection, overcoming limitations of proxy-based approaches.

Abstract: Unsupervised hallucination detection aims to identify hallucinated content
generated by large language models (LLMs) without relying on labeled data.
While unsupervised methods have gained popularity by eliminating
labor-intensive human annotations, they frequently rely on proxy signals
unrelated to factual correctness. This misalignment biases detection probes
toward superficial or non-truth-related aspects, limiting generalizability
across datasets and scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IRIS,
an unsupervised hallucination detection framework, leveraging internal
representations intrinsic to factual correctness. IRIS prompts the LLM to
carefully verify the truthfulness of a given statement, and obtain its
contextualized embedding as informative features for training. Meanwhile, the
uncertainty of each response is considered a soft pseudolabel for truthfulness.
Experimental results demonstrate that IRIS consistently outperforms existing
unsupervised methods. Our approach is fully unsupervised, computationally low
cost, and works well even with few training data, making it suitable for
real-time detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Open-source LLMs (LLama2-7B, Mistral-7B, Yi-6B) evaluated on multi-label intent classification using MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset in few-shot setting. Mistral-7B performed best among LLMs, but BERT-based supervised classifier outperformed all few-shot LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the effectiveness of open-source LLMs that can run on consumer hardware for multi-label intent classification in dialogue systems, providing accessible alternatives to proprietary models.

Method: Used MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset with few-shot setup (20 examples per prompt). Evaluated three open-source LLMs (LLama2-7B, Mistral-7B, Yi-6B) and compared against BERT-based supervised learning baseline. Measured accuracy, precision, recall, F1 scores, inference time, and VRAM requirements.

Result: Mistral-7B outperformed other LLMs on 11 out of 14 intent classes with weighted F1 score of 0.50, showing lower Humming Loss and higher Jaccard Similarity. However, BERT-based supervised classifier achieved superior performance compared to the best few-shot LLM.

Conclusion: While open-source LLMs show promise for multi-intent detection in few-shot settings, supervised BERT models still outperform them. The study provides a framework for using small open-source LLMs to enhance NLU in task-oriented chatbots.

Abstract: In this paper, we provide an extensive analysis of multi-label intent
classification using Large Language Models (LLMs) that are open-source,
publicly available, and can be run in consumer hardware. We use the MultiWOZ
2.1 dataset, a benchmark in the dialogue system domain, to investigate the
efficacy of three popular open-source pre-trained LLMs, namely LLama2-7B-hf,
Mistral-7B-v0.1, and Yi-6B. We perform the classification task in a few-shot
setup, giving 20 examples in the prompt with some instructions. Our approach
focuses on the differences in performance of these models across several
performance metrics by methodically assessing these models on multi-label
intent classification tasks. Additionally, we compare the performance of the
instruction-based fine-tuning approach with supervised learning using the
smaller transformer model BertForSequenceClassification as a baseline. To
evaluate the performance of the models, we use evaluation metrics like
accuracy, precision, and recall as well as micro, macro, and weighted F1 score.
We also report the inference time, VRAM requirements, etc. The Mistral-7B-v0.1
outperforms two other generative models on 11 intent classes out of 14 in terms
of F-Score, with a weighted average of 0.50. It also has relatively lower
Humming Loss and higher Jaccard Similarity, making it the winning model in the
few-shot setting. We find BERT based supervised classifier having superior
performance compared to the best performing few-shot generative LLM. The study
provides a framework for small open-source LLMs in detecting complex
multi-intent dialogues, enhancing the Natural Language Understanding aspect of
task-oriented chatbots.

TL;DR: Study analyzes social media language to track bipolar disorder diagnosis timing and shows pervasive linguistic changes reflecting mood disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, and seasonal patterns over decades.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical assessments for bipolar disorder are limited in scale, while social media language analysis offers high temporal resolution and longitudinal scope for studying mental health markers.

Method: Introduced a method to determine timing of users' diagnoses and analyzed language trajectories from 3 years before to 21 years after bipolar diagnosis, comparing with unipolar depression and non-affected users.

Result: BD diagnosis accompanied by pervasive linguistic alterations reflecting mood disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, substance abuse, hospitalization, and disorganized thought. Recurring mood-related language changes with 12-month periodicity suggestive of seasonal episodes, with increased periodicity in female users.

Conclusion: Findings provide evidence for language alterations in both acute and chronic phases of bipolar disorder, validating social media as a scalable tool for mental health monitoring.

Abstract: Language provides valuable markers of affective disorders such as bipolar
disorder (BD), yet clinical assessments remain limited in scale. In response,
analyses of social media (SM) language have gained prominence due to their high
temporal resolution and longitudinal scope. Here, we introduce a method to
determine the timing of users' diagnoses and apply it to study language
trajectories from 3 years before to 21 years after BD diagnosis - contrasted
with uses reporting unipolar depression (UD) and non-affected users (HC). We
show that BD diagnosis is accompanied by pervasive linguistic alterations
reflecting mood disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, substance abuse,
hospitalization, medical comorbidities, unusual thought content, and
disorganized thought. We further observe recurring mood-related language
changes across two decades after the diagnosis, with a pronounced 12-month
periodicity suggestive of seasonal mood episodes. Finally, trend-level evidence
suggests an increased periodicity in users estimated to be female. In sum, our
findings provide evidence for language alterations in the acute and chronic
phase of BD. This validates and extends recent efforts leveraging SM for
scalable monitoring of mental health.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the effectiveness of model diversity, confidence-informed fusion, and intelligent data augmentation for robust Arabic readability prediction.

Abstract: We present MSAs winning system for the BAREC 2025 Shared Task on fine-grained
Arabic readability assessment, achieving first place in six of six tracks. Our
approach is a confidence-weighted ensemble of four complementary transformer
models (AraBERTv2, AraELECTRA, MARBERT, and CAMeLBERT) each fine-tuned with
distinct loss functions to capture diverse readability signals. To tackle
severe class imbalance and data scarcity, we applied weighted training,
advanced preprocessing, SAMER corpus relabeling with our strongest model, and
synthetic data generation via Gemini 2.5 Flash, adding about 10,000 rare-level
samples. A targeted post-processing step corrected prediction distribution
skew, delivering a 6.3 percent Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) gain. Our system
reached 87.5 percent QWK at the sentence level and 87.4 percent at the document
level, demonstrating the power of model and loss diversity, confidence-informed
fusion, and intelligent augmentation for robust Arabic readability prediction.

*Dongmin Choi,Woojung Song,Jongwook Han,Eun-Ju Lee,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Established psychometric questionnaires (BFI, PVQ) yield different personality profiles for LLMs compared to ecologically valid questionnaires, showing they don't accurately reflect LLM behavior in real-world contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about applying human-designed psychological questionnaires to LLMs due to lack of ecological validity - these surveys don't reflect real-world contexts where LLMs generate text in response to user queries.

Method: Comprehensive comparative analysis between established psychometric questionnaires and ecologically valid questionnaires when applied to measure personality traits and values in LLM responses.

Result: Established questionnaires: (1) yield substantially different LLM profiles than ecologically valid ones, (2) have insufficient items for stable measurement, (3) create misleading impressions of stable constructs in LLMs, and (4) produce exaggerated profiles for persona-prompted LLMs.

Conclusion: Researchers should avoid using established psychological questionnaires for LLMs due to their lack of ecological validity and misleading results. Ecologically valid questionnaires provide more accurate assessments of LLM behavior in real-world contexts.

Abstract: Researchers have applied established psychometric questionnaires (e.g., BFI,
PVQ) to measure the personality traits and values reflected in the responses of
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, concerns have been raised about applying
these human-designed questionnaires to LLMs. One such concern is their lack of
ecological validity--the extent to which survey questions adequately reflect
and resemble real-world contexts in which LLMs generate texts in response to
user queries. However, it remains unclear how established questionnaires and
ecologically valid questionnaires differ in their outcomes, and what insights
these differences may provide. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive
comparative analysis of the two types of questionnaires. Our analysis reveals
that established questionnaires (1) yield substantially different profiles of
LLMs from ecologically valid ones, deviating from the psychological
characteristics expressed in the context of user queries, (2) suffer from
insufficient items for stable measurement, (3) create misleading impressions
that LLMs possess stable constructs, and (4) yield exaggerated profiles for
persona-prompted LLMs. Overall, our work cautions against the use of
established psychological questionnaires for LLMs. Our code will be released
upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing complexity and volume of climate science literature makes it difficult for researchers to find relevant information across different models, datasets, regions, and variables using traditional keyword-based search.

Method: Built a domain-specific Knowledge Graph from climate publications and scientific texts, using Cypher queries for structured semantic queries, and integrated with large language models in RAG systems.

Result: The KG enables researchers to discover precise connections such as which models have been validated in specific regions or which datasets are commonly used with certain teleconnection patterns.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates real-world value for climate researchers and model developers by providing accurate, contextual scientific information through semantic querying beyond traditional search methods.

Abstract: The growing complexity and volume of climate science literature make it
increasingly difficult for researchers to find relevant information across
models, datasets, regions, and variables. This paper introduces a
domain-specific Knowledge Graph (KG) built from climate publications and
broader scientific texts, aimed at improving how climate knowledge is accessed
and used. Unlike keyword based search, our KG supports structured, semantic
queries that help researchers discover precise connections such as which models
have been validated in specific regions or which datasets are commonly used
with certain teleconnection patterns. We demonstrate how the KG answers such
questions using Cypher queries, and outline its integration with large language
models in RAG systems to improve transparency and reliability in
climate-related question answering. This work moves beyond KG construction to
show its real world value for climate researchers, model developers, and others
who rely on accurate, contextual scientific information.

*Abdulrahman Allam,Seif Ahmed,Ali Hamdi,Ammar Mohammed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuned LLMs for Arabic medical text generation to provide accurate medical advice, with Mistral-7B achieving best performance (68.5% F1-score).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing hospital management systems that lack accurate real-time medical advice for irregular inputs and underrepresented languages like Arabic.

Method: Collected real-world medical conversations from social media, preprocessed for Arabic dialects, and fine-tuned Mistral-7B, LLaMA-2-7B, and GPT-2 Medium models.

Result: Fine-tuned Mistral-7B outperformed others with 68.5% precision, 69.08% recall, and 68.5% F1-score in BERT Score evaluations.

Conclusion: Generative AI shows strong potential for advancing hospital management systems, offering scalable solutions for diverse linguistic and cultural healthcare environments.

Abstract: Efficient hospital management systems (HMS) are critical worldwide to address
challenges such as overcrowding, limited resources, and poor availability of
urgent health care. Existing methods often lack the ability to provide
accurate, real-time medical advice, particularly for irregular inputs and
underrepresented languages. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes
an approach that fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) for Arabic medical
text generation. The system is designed to assist patients by providing
accurate medical advice, diagnoses, drug recommendations, and treatment plans
based on user input. The research methodology required the collection of a
unique dataset from social media platforms, capturing real-world medical
conversations between patients and doctors. The dataset, which includes patient
complaints together with medical advice, was properly cleaned and preprocessed
to account for multiple Arabic dialects. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art
generative models, such as Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, LLaMA-2-7B, and GPT-2
Medium, optimized the system's ability to generate reliable medical text.
Results from evaluations indicate that the fine-tuned Mistral-7B model
outperformed the other models, achieving average BERT (Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers) Score values in precision, recall, and
F1-scores of 68.5\%, 69.08\%, and 68.5\%, respectively. Comparative
benchmarking and qualitative assessments validate the system's ability to
produce coherent and relevant medical replies to informal input. This study
highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in
advancing HMS, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for global healthcare
challenges, especially in linguistically and culturally diverse environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Synthetic data augmentation using ChatGPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro expands Arabic medical chatbot training from 20K to 100K records, improving model performance with ChatGPT-4o data showing superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated Arabic medical datasets that constrain the development of medical chatbots and limit model scalability and generalization.

Method: Generated 80,000 synthetic question-answer pairs using ChatGPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro, semantically filtered and manually validated them, then fine-tuned five LLMs (including Mistral-7B and AraGPT2) and evaluated using BERTScore metrics and expert assessments with ablation studies.

Result: ChatGPT-4o generated data consistently led to higher F1-scores and fewer hallucinations across all models compared to Gemini-generated data.

Conclusion: Synthetic augmentation is a viable practical solution for enhancing domain-specific language models in low-resource medical NLP, enabling more inclusive, scalable, and accurate Arabic healthcare chatbot systems.

Abstract: The development of medical chatbots in Arabic is significantly constrained by
the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. While prior
efforts compiled a dataset of 20,000 Arabic patient-doctor interactions from
social media to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), model scalability and
generalization remained limited. In this study, we propose a scalable synthetic
data augmentation strategy to expand the training corpus to 100,000 records.
Using advanced generative AI systems ChatGPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro we generated
80,000 contextually relevant and medically coherent synthetic question-answer
pairs grounded in the structure of the original dataset. These synthetic
samples were semantically filtered, manually validated, and integrated into the
training pipeline. We fine-tuned five LLMs, including Mistral-7B and AraGPT2,
and evaluated their performance using BERTScore metrics and expert-driven
qualitative assessments. To further analyze the effectiveness of synthetic
sources, we conducted an ablation study comparing ChatGPT-4o and
Gemini-generated data independently. The results showed that ChatGPT-4o data
consistently led to higher F1-scores and fewer hallucinations across all
models. Overall, our findings demonstrate the viability of synthetic
augmentation as a practical solution for enhancing domain-specific language
models in-low resource medical NLP, paving the way for more inclusive,
scalable, and accurate Arabic healthcare chatbot systems.

TL;DR: Combined prominence detection and ASR for Austrian German using wav2vec2 models, achieving 85.53% prominence accuracy without affecting baseline ASR performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop prominence-aware automatic speech recognition that can simultaneously transcribe words and their prominence levels for conversational Austrian German, with applications in linguistic research and prosody-informed dialogue systems.

Method: Fine-tuned wav2vec2 models for word-level prominence detection, used the detector to automatically annotate a large corpus, then trained novel prominence-aware ASR systems that transcribe both words and prominence levels simultaneously.

Result: Integration of prominence information did not change performance compared to baseline ASR system, while achieving 85.53% prominence detection accuracy for utterances with correct word recognition.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models can effectively encode prosodic information, representing a novel contribution to prosody-enhanced ASR with potential applications in linguistics and dialogue systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates prominence-aware automatic speech recognition (ASR)
by combining prominence detection and speech recognition for conversational
Austrian German. First, prominence detectors were developed by fine-tuning
wav2vec2 models to classify word-level prominence. The detector was then used
to automatically annotate prosodic prominence in a large corpus. Based on those
annotations, we trained novel prominence-aware ASR systems that simultaneously
transcribe words and their prominence levels. The integration of prominence
information did not change performance compared to our baseline ASR system,
while reaching a prominence detection accuracy of 85.53% for utterances where
the recognized word sequence was correct. This paper shows that
transformer-based models can effectively encode prosodic information and
represents a novel contribution to prosody-enhanced ASR, with potential
applications for linguistic research and prosody-informed dialogue systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A systematic framework for generating high-quality, population-aligned persona sets for LLM-based social simulations, addressing biases in existing approaches through narrative persona generation, quality filtering, and importance sampling for psychometric alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based social simulation studies focus on agent frameworks but overlook persona generation complexities, leading to unrepresentative persona sets and biases that limit the authenticity of social simulations.

Method: Leverage LLMs to generate narrative personas from social media data, apply quality assessment filtering, use importance sampling for global alignment with psychometric distributions (Big Five traits), and include task-specific module for subpopulation adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly reduces population-level bias and enables accurate, flexible social simulation for various research and policy applications.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a systematic approach to creating authentic, representative persona sets that improve the fidelity and reliability of LLM-driven social simulations.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled human-like
social simulations at unprecedented scale and fidelity, offering new
opportunities for computational social science. A key challenge, however, is
the construction of persona sets that authentically represent the diversity and
distribution of real-world populations. Most existing LLM-based social
simulation studies focus primarily on designing agentic frameworks and
simulation environments, often overlooking the complexities of persona
generation and the potential biases introduced by unrepresentative persona
sets. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for synthesizing
high-quality, population-aligned persona sets for LLM-driven social simulation.
Our approach begins by leveraging LLMs to generate narrative personas from
long-term social media data, followed by rigorous quality assessment to filter
out low-fidelity profiles. We then apply importance sampling to achieve global
alignment with reference psychometric distributions, such as the Big Five
personality traits. To address the needs of specific simulation contexts, we
further introduce a task-specific module that adapts the globally aligned
persona set to targeted subpopulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method significantly reduces population-level bias and enables accurate,
flexible social simulation for a wide range of research and policy
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately localizing answers within documents remains a major challenge for VLMs, limiting interpretability and real-world applicability despite strong text extraction capabilities.

Method: Introduces a plug-and-play bounding-box prediction module that works with existing VLMs (including proprietary systems) by decoupling answer generation from spatial localization.

Result: Systematic evaluation reveals a gap between textual accuracy and spatial grounding, showing correct answers often lack reliable localization. The framework provides quantitative insights into these shortcomings.

Conclusion: Establishes a benchmark for future research toward more interpretable and robust document information extraction VLMs, highlighting the need for improved spatial localization capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities in document
understanding, particularly in identifying and extracting textual information
from complex documents. Despite this, accurately localizing answers within
documents remains a major challenge, limiting both interpretability and
real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce
\textit{DocExplainerV0}, a plug-and-play bounding-box prediction module that
decouples answer generation from spatial localization. This design makes it
applicable to existing VLMs, including proprietary systems where fine-tuning is
not feasible. Through systematic evaluation, we provide quantitative insights
into the gap between textual accuracy and spatial grounding, showing that
correct answers often lack reliable localization. Our standardized framework
highlights these shortcomings and establishes a benchmark for future research
toward more interpretable and robust document information extraction VLMs.

TL;DR: This study compares human-written texts with AI-generated texts using Biber's multidimensional analysis to identify systematic differences and create a benchmark for evaluating language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how large language models (LLMs) differ from human writing in terms of register variation, particularly focusing on dimensions where AI-generated texts show systematic deviations from human writing patterns.

Method: Applied Biber's multidimensional analysis (MDA) to compare human-written texts from BE-21 corpus with AI-generated counterparts from AI-Brown corpus. Replicated analysis for Czech using AI-Koditex corpus. Examined 16 frontier LLMs with various settings and prompts, comparing base models vs instruction-tuned models.

Result: Identified specific dimensions of variation where LLMs differ most significantly and systematically from human writing patterns. Created a benchmark for comparing and ranking models across interpretable dimensions.

Conclusion: The study provides a systematic framework for evaluating LLM-generated text quality by identifying measurable differences from human writing patterns, with implications for model development and evaluation across multiple languages.

Abstract: This study investigates the register variation in texts written by humans and
comparable texts produced by large language models (LLMs). Biber's
multidimensional analysis (MDA) is applied to a sample of human-written texts
and AI-created texts generated to be their counterparts to find the dimensions
of variation in which LLMs differ most significantly and most systematically
from humans. As textual material, a new LLM-generated corpus AI-Brown is used,
which is comparable to BE-21 (a Brown family corpus representing contemporary
British English). Since all languages except English are underrepresented in
the training data of frontier LLMs, similar analysis is replicated on Czech
using AI-Koditex corpus and Czech multidimensional model. Examined were 16
frontier models in various settings and prompts, with emphasis placed on the
difference between base models and instruction-tuned models. Based on this, a
benchmark is created through which models can be compared with each other and
ranked in interpretable dimensions.

*Leen Almajed,Abeer ALdayel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs often generate unrealistically positive responses that feel dismissive, especially in high-stakes emotional conversations. The study analyzes this incongruent positivity phenomenon across different emotional intensity levels and develops detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how well-intended positive support can misfire and feel dismissive in emotional conversations, particularly comparing human vs LLM responses across different emotional intensity contexts.

Method: Collected real user-assistant dialogues from Reddit across emotional intensities (Mild: relationship tension/advice, Severe: grief/anxiety), generated LLM responses, developed weakly supervised multilabel classifier ensemble (DeBERTa and MentalBERT), and fine-tuned LLMs on datasets with varying emotional reactions.

Result: LLMs are more prone to unrealistic positivity through dismissive and minimizing tone, particularly in high-stakes contexts. The classifier ensemble showed improved detection of incongruent positivity types across different concern levels.

Conclusion: Need to move beyond generic positive responses and develop congruent support measures that balance positive affect with emotional acknowledgment for context-aware, trust-preserving conversation systems.

Abstract: In emotionally supportive conversations, well-intended positivity can
sometimes misfire, leading to responses that feel dismissive, minimizing, or
unrealistically optimistic. We examine this phenomenon of incongruent
positivity as miscalibrated expressions of positive support in both human and
LLM generated responses. To this end, we collected real user-assistant
dialogues from Reddit across a range of emotional intensities and generated
additional responses using large language models for the same context. We
categorize these conversations by intensity into two levels: Mild, which covers
relationship tension and general advice, and Severe, which covers grief and
anxiety conversations. This level of categorization enables a comparative
analysis of how supportive responses vary across lower and higher stakes
contexts. Our analysis reveals that LLMs are more prone to unrealistic
positivity through dismissive and minimizing tone, particularly in high-stakes
contexts. To further study the underlying dimensions of this phenomenon, we
finetune LLMs on datasets with strong and weak emotional reactions. Moreover,
we developed a weakly supervised multilabel classifier ensemble (DeBERTa and
MentalBERT) that shows improved detection of incongruent positivity types
across two sorts of concerns (Mild and Severe). Our findings shed light on the
need to move beyond merely generating generic positive responses and instead
study the congruent support measures to balance positive affect with emotional
acknowledgment. This approach offers insights into aligning large language
models with affective expectations in the online supportive dialogue, paving
the way toward context-aware and trust preserving online conversation systems.

*Miklós Sebők,Viktor Kovács,Martin Bánóczy,Daniel Møller Eriksen,Nathalie Neptune,Philippe Roussille*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares language models for long document classification, finding that specialized long-context models like Longformer don't outperform standard models, and open models beat GPT variants on legislative text classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing language models like BERT have input length limitations that prevent processing long documents like laws and bills, which can be hundreds of pages long. This creates a need for effective long-text classification methods.

Method: Experiments with XLM-RoBERTa, Longformer, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 models across 5 languages for multiclass classification using the Comparative Agendas Project codebook with 21 policy topic labels.

Result: No advantage found for Longformer (specifically designed for long inputs). Open models outperformed GPT variants. Performance depends on support and substance overlaps between categories.

Conclusion: Specialized long-context models don't necessarily outperform standard models for long document classification, and open models can be more effective than proprietary GPT models for this task.

Abstract: The most widely used large language models in the social sciences (such as
BERT, and its derivatives, e.g. RoBERTa) have a limitation on the input text
length that they can process to produce predictions. This is a particularly
pressing issue for some classification tasks, where the aim is to handle long
input texts. One such area deals with laws and draft laws (bills), which can
have a length of multiple hundred pages and, therefore, are not particularly
amenable for processing with models that can only handle e.g. 512 tokens. In
this paper, we show results from experiments covering 5 languages with
XLM-RoBERTa, Longformer, GPT-3.5, GPT-4 models for the multiclass
classification task of the Comparative Agendas Project, which has a codebook of
21 policy topic labels from education to health care. Results show no
particular advantage for the Longformer model, pre-trained specifically for the
purposes of handling long inputs. The comparison between the GPT variants and
the best-performing open model yielded an edge for the latter. An analysis of
class-level factors points to the importance of support and substance overlaps
between specific categories when it comes to performance on long text inputs.

TL;DR: SI FACT is a self-improving framework that uses contrastive learning to make LLMs more faithful to provided context rather than relying on internal knowledge, achieving 6.2% improvement in contextual recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate unfaithful responses in knowledge-intensive tasks due to knowledge conflict - preferring internal parametric knowledge over provided context.

Method: Self-instruct mechanism generates contrastive learning data (anchor, positive, negative samples) automatically, then uses contrastive learning to pull faithful responses closer and push unfaithful ones apart in representation space.

Result: SI FACT based on Llama3-8B improves Contextual Recall Rate by 6.2% over best baseline on ECARE KRE and COSE KRE benchmarks, while reducing dependence on internal memory.

Conclusion: The framework provides strong effectiveness and high data efficiency for enhancing contextual faithfulness, offering a practical pathway toward more trustworthy language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models often generate unfaithful responses in knowledge
intensive tasks due to knowledge conflict,that is,a preference for relying on
internal parametric knowledge rather than the provided context.To address this
issue,we propose a novel self improving framework,Self Improving Faithfulness
Aware Contrastive Tuning.The framework uses a self instruct mechanism that
allows the base LLM to automatically generate high quality,structured
contrastive learning data,including anchor samples,semantically equivalent
positive samples,and negative samples simulating unfaithful scenarios.This
approach significantly reduces the cost of manual
annotation.Subsequently,contrastive learning is applied to train the
model,enabling it to pull faithful responses closer and push unfaithful
responses farther apart in the representation space.Experiments on knowledge
conflict evaluation benchmarks ECARE KRE and COSE KRE show that the SI FACT
model based on Llama3 8B Instruct improves the Contextual Recall Rate by 6.2%
over the best baseline method,while significantly reducing dependence on
internal memory.The results indicate that SI FACT provides strong effectiveness
and high data efficiency in enhancing the contextual faithfulness of
LLMs,offering a practical pathway toward building more proactive and
trustworthy language models.

*Yixiao Zhou,Ziyu Zhao,Dongzhou Cheng,zhiliang wu,Jie Gui,Yi Yang,Fei Wu,Yu Cheng,Hehe Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DERN is a retraining-free framework that prunes redundant experts and recombines neurons to reduce memory usage in SMoE models while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMoE architectures require loading all expert parameters despite sparse activation, leading to high memory usage and deployment challenges. Previous methods focused on expert-level operations but neglected neuron-level structure.

Method: Three-step approach: 1) Prune redundant experts using router statistics, 2) Decompose experts into neuron-level segments and assign to compatible retained experts, 3) Merge segments within each retained expert to create compact representations.

Result: Improves performance by more than 5% on commonsense reasoning and MMLU benchmarks under 50% expert sparsity, reduces number of experts and memory usage without extra training.

Conclusion: DERN effectively addresses neuron-level misalignment and semantic conflicts in SMoE models, enabling more efficient deployment while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures are widely used in large
language models (LLMs) due to their computational efficiency. However, though
only a few experts are activated for each token, SMoE still requires loading
all expert parameters, leading to high memory usage and challenges in
deployment. Previous work has tried to reduce the overhead by pruning and
merging experts, but primarily focused on expert-level operations, leaving
neuron-level structure underexplored. We propose DERN (Dropping Experts,
Recombining Neurons), a task-agnostic and retraining-free framework for expert
pruning and reconstruction. We observe that experts are often misaligned and
contain semantic conflicts at the neuron level, which poses challenges for
direct merging. To solve this, DERN works in three steps: it first prunes
redundant experts using router statistics; then it decomposes them into
neuron-level expert segments, assigning each segment to its most compatible
retained expert; and finally, it merges segments within each retained expert to
build a compact representation. Experiments on Mixtral, Qwen, and DeepSeek SMoE
models show that DERN improves performance by more than 5% on commonsense
reasoning and MMLU benchmarks under 50% expert sparsity, without extra
training. It also greatly reduces the number of experts and memory usage,
making SMoE LLMs easier to deploy in practice.

### [112] [Is In-Context Learning Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10414)
*Adrian de Wynter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICL enables autoregressive models to solve tasks through next-token prediction without additional training, but its learning capabilities are limited and sensitive to distributional changes and prompting styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether in-context learning (ICL) truly constitutes learning or is merely deduction based on prior knowledge and exemplars, and to characterize its limitations and capabilities.

Method: Conducted a large-scale analysis of ICL by ablating memorization, pretraining, distributional shifts, and prompting styles, examining various factors that influence ICL performance.

Result: ICL is effective but limited in learning and generalizing to unseen tasks; accuracy becomes insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt style, and linguistic features with more exemplars, but remains distributionally sensitive, especially in chain-of-thought prompting.

Conclusion: Autoregression's ad-hoc encoding in ICL is not a robust mechanism, indicating limited all-purpose generalizability, as evidenced by varied accuracies on formally similar tasks.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows some autoregressive models to solve tasks
via next-token prediction and without needing further training. This has led to
claims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a
few shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply
learning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the
models rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue
that, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full
characterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale
analysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining,
distributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an
effective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise
to unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more
numerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt
style, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from
regularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity,
especially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought. Given the varied
accuracies on formally similar tasks, we conclude that autoregression's ad-hoc
encoding is not a robust mechanism, and suggests limited all-purpose
generalisability.

### [113] [Long Context Automated Essay Scoring with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10417)
*Christopher Ormerod,Gitit Kehat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates transformer models with architectural modifications to handle long essays for automated scoring, addressing the limitation of standard models that require truncation of lengthy student essays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard transformer models have fixed maximum length constraints, forcing truncation of longer student essays which undermines the validity of automated essay scoring by preventing proper assessment of organizational elements that require long contexts.

Method: The study evaluates several modified transformer architectures including fine-tuned versions of XLNet, Longformer, ModernBERT, Mamba, and Llama models using the Kaggle ASAP 2.0 dataset to overcome length limitations.

Result: The paper presents evaluation results comparing these modified architectures' performance on handling long essays without truncation, though specific results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: Architectural modifications to transformer models can potentially overcome length limitations for automated essay scoring, allowing proper assessment of organizational elements that require long contexts without truncation.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models are architecturally constrained to process
text of a fixed maximum length. Essays written by higher-grade students
frequently exceed the maximum allowed length for many popular open-source
models. A common approach to addressing this issue when using these models for
Automated Essay Scoring is to truncate the input text. This raises serious
validity concerns as it undermines the model's ability to fully capture and
evaluate organizational elements of the scoring rubric, which requires long
contexts to assess. In this study, we evaluate several models that incorporate
architectural modifications of the standard transformer architecture to
overcome these length limitations using the Kaggle ASAP 2.0 dataset. The models
considered in this study include fine-tuned versions of XLNet, Longformer,
ModernBERT, Mamba, and Llama models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A cloud-edge collaborative architecture with GuideLLM, SolverLLM, and JudgeLLM components for enhanced LLM reasoning, tested on RefactorCoderQA benchmark achieving 76.84% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing benchmarks and optimize reasoning capabilities of LLMs through structured multi-agent collaboration.

Method: Proposed a three-component framework: GuideLLM (edge deployment), SolverLLM (cloud-based solution generation), and JudgeLLM (automated evaluation). Used RefactorCoderQA benchmark with authentic Stack Overflow challenges across multiple domains.

Result: RefactorCoder-MoE achieved state-of-the-art 76.84% accuracy, outperforming leading open-source and commercial baselines. Human evaluations confirmed interpretability and practical relevance.

Conclusion: The cloud-edge collaborative architecture with specialized LLM components effectively enhances reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, validated by comprehensive benchmarking and human evaluation.

Abstract: To optimize the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), we propose a novel cloud-edge collaborative architecture that
enables a structured, multi-agent prompting framework. This framework comprises
three specialized components: GuideLLM, a lightweight model deployed at the
edge to provide methodological guidance; SolverLLM, a more powerful model
hosted in the cloud responsible for generating code solutions; and JudgeLLM, an
automated evaluator for assessing solution correctness and quality. To evaluate
and demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture in realistic settings,
we introduce RefactorCoderQA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
and enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across multi-domain
coding tasks. Motivated by the limitations of existing benchmarks,
RefactorCoderQA systematically covers various technical domains, including
Software Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Natural Language
Processing, using authentic coding challenges from Stack Overflow. Extensive
experiments reveal that our fine-tuned model, RefactorCoder-MoE, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming leading open-source
and commercial baselines with an overall accuracy of 76.84%. Human evaluations
further validate the interpretability, accuracy, and practical relevance of the
generated solutions. In addition, we evaluate system-level metrics, such as
throughput and latency, to gain deeper insights into the performance
characteristics and trade-offs of the proposed architecture.

*Rui Lu,Zhenyu Hou,Zihan Wang,Hanchen Zhang,Xiao Liu,Yujiang Li,Shi Feng,Jie Tang,Yuxiao Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepDive is a system that enhances LLMs as deep search agents through automated question synthesis from knowledge graphs and multi-turn reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on search benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open LLMs perform poorly as deep search agents due to limited long-horizon reasoning with browsing tools and lack of sufficiently difficult supervised training data.

Method: 1) Automatically synthesize complex questions from open knowledge graphs 2) Apply end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning with deep search

Result: DeepDive-32B achieves new open-source competitive results on BrowseComp, outperforming WebSailor, DeepSeek-R1-Browse, and Search-o1. Multi-turn RL training significantly improves deep search ability across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: DeepDive enables effective test-time scaling of tool calls and parallel sampling, providing a robust framework for developing advanced deep search agents with open LLMs.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with browsing tools substantially
improves their potential as deep search agents to solve complex, real-world
tasks. Yet, open LLMs still perform poorly in such settings due to limited
long-horizon reasoning capacity with browsing tools and the lack of
sufficiently difficult supervised data. To address these challenges, we present
DeepDive to advance deep search agents. First, we propose a strategy to
automatically synthesize complex, difficult, and hard-to-find questions from
open knowledge graphs. Second, we apply end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement
learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning with deep search.
Experiments show that DeepDive-32B achieves a new open-source competitive
result on BrowseComp, outperforming WebSailor, DeepSeek-R1-Browse, and
Search-o1. We demonstrate that multi-turn RL training improves deep search
ability and significantly contributes to the performance improvements across
multiple benchmarks. We observe that DeepDive enables test-time scaling of tool
calls and parallel sampling. All datasets, models, and code are publicly

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WhisTLE is a text-only adaptation method for pretrained ASR models that uses a VAE to model encoder outputs from text and fine-tunes the decoder, achieving significant WER reductions without extra runtime cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained ASR models like Whisper need domain adaptation for unseen vocabulary and parlance, but collecting speech data is often impractical, necessitating text-only adaptation methods.

Method: Proposes WhisTLE which trains a variational autoencoder (VAE) to model encoder outputs from text, fine-tunes the decoder using the learned text-to-latent encoder, and optionally combines with TTS adaptation. Original encoder is restored at inference.

Result: Across 4 out-of-domain datasets and 4 ASR models, WhisTLE with TTS reduces WER by 12.3% relative to TTS-only adaptation and outperforms all non-WhisTLE baselines in 27 of 32 scenarios.

Conclusion: WhisTLE provides an effective text-only adaptation approach for pretrained ASR models that significantly improves performance on out-of-domain data without additional runtime costs.

Abstract: Pretrained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models such as Whisper perform
well but still need domain adaptation to handle unseen vocabulary and parlance.
In many real-world settings, collecting speech data is impractical,
necessitating text-only adaptation. We propose WhisTLE, a deeply supervised,
text-only adaptation method for pretrained encoder-decoder ASR models. WhisTLE
trains a variational autoencoder (VAE) to model encoder outputs from text and
fine-tunes the decoder using the learned text-to-latent encoder, optionally
combined with text-to-speech (TTS) adaptation. At inference, the original
encoder is restored, incurring no extra runtime cost. Across four out-of-domain
datasets and four ASR models, WhisTLE with TTS reduces word error rate (WER) by
12.3% relative to TTS-only adaptation and outperforms all non-WhisTLE baselines
in 27 of 32 scenarios.

*Umut Eser,Yael Gozin,L. Jay Stallons,Ari Caroline,Martin Preusse,Brandon Rice,Scott Wright,Andrew Robertson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoIND LLM platform reduces IND application drafting time by ~97% (from ~100h to 2.6-3.7h) while maintaining acceptable quality with no critical regulatory errors, though human experts are still needed for final refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IND application preparation is time-intensive and expertise-dependent, slowing early clinical development. The study aims to evaluate if LLMs can accelerate this process while maintaining quality.

Method: Compared AutoIND-generated IND summaries against manual drafting benchmarks. Measured drafting times directly and assessed quality through blinded regulatory writing assessment using 7 criteria (correctness, completeness, conciseness, consistency, clarity, redundancy, emphasis) scored 0-3.

Result: 97% time reduction (100h → 3.7h for IND-1, 2.6h for IND-2). Quality scores: 69.6% and 77.9%. No critical regulatory errors found, but deficiencies in emphasis, conciseness, and clarity noted.

Conclusion: AutoIND dramatically accelerates IND drafting but expert regulatory writers remain essential for final refinement. Identified deficiencies provide roadmap for targeted model improvements.

Abstract: Background: Investigational New Drug (IND) application preparation is
time-intensive and expertise-dependent, slowing early clinical development.
Objective: To evaluate whether a large language model (LLM) platform (AutoIND)
can reduce first-draft composition time while maintaining document quality in
regulatory submissions. Methods: Drafting times for IND nonclinical written
summaries (eCTD modules 2.6.2, 2.6.4, 2.6.6) generated by AutoIND were directly
recorded. For comparison, manual drafting times for IND summaries previously
cleared by the U.S. FDA were estimated from the experience of regulatory
writers ($\geq$6 years) and used as industry-standard benchmarks. Quality was
assessed by a blinded regulatory writing assessor using seven pre-specified
categories: correctness, completeness, conciseness, consistency, clarity,
redundancy, and emphasis. Each sub-criterion was scored 0-3 and normalized to a
percentage. A critical regulatory error was defined as any misrepresentation or
omission likely to alter regulatory interpretation (e.g., incorrect NOAEL,
omission of mandatory GLP dose-formulation analysis). Results: AutoIND reduced
initial drafting time by $\sim$97% (from $\sim$100 h to 3.7 h for 18,870
pages/61 reports in IND-1; and to 2.6 h for 11,425 pages/58 reports in IND-2).
Quality scores were 69.6\% and 77.9\% for IND-1 and IND-2. No critical
regulatory errors were detected, but deficiencies in emphasis, conciseness, and
clarity were noted. Conclusions: AutoIND can dramatically accelerate IND
drafting, but expert regulatory writers remain essential to mature outputs to
submission-ready quality. Systematic deficiencies identified provide a roadmap
for targeted model improvements.

Conclusion: Boldsea provides an effective architecture for executable ontologies that can model complex dynamic systems while overcoming traditional limitations through semantic-event integration and direct interpretation of models as algorithms.

Abstract: This paper presents boldsea, Boldachev's semantic-event approach -- an
architecture for modeling complex dynamic systems using executable ontologies
-- semantic models that act as dynamic structures, directly controlling process
execution. We demonstrate that integrating event semantics with a dataflow
architecture addresses the limitations of traditional Business Process
Management (BPM) systems and object-oriented semantic technologies. The paper
presents the formal BSL (boldsea Semantic Language), including its BNF grammar,

### [119] [How well can LLMs provide planning feedback in grounded environments?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09790)
*Yuxuan Li,Victor Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Foundation models (LLMs/VLMs) can provide high-quality planning feedback across diverse environments, with larger reasoning models performing best, though performance degrades in complex continuous spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the need for carefully designed reward functions and annotated demonstrations in grounded environment planning by leveraging pretrained foundation models' background knowledge.

Method: Evaluate LLMs and VLMs on providing various feedback types (binary, preference, action advising, goal advising, delta action) across symbolic, language, and continuous control environments using different inference methods (in-context learning, chain-of-thought, environment dynamics access).

Result: Foundation models provide diverse high-quality feedback across domains; larger reasoning models give more accurate feedback with less bias and benefit more from enhanced inference methods; feedback quality degrades in environments with complex dynamics or continuous state/action spaces.

Conclusion: Pretrained foundation models are effective for providing planning feedback, with model size and reasoning capabilities being key factors, though they struggle with complex continuous environments.

Abstract: Learning to plan in grounded environments typically requires carefully
designed reward functions or high-quality annotated demonstrations. Recent
works show that pretrained foundation models, such as large language models
(LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), capture background knowledge helpful
for planning, which reduces the amount of reward design and demonstrations
needed for policy learning. We evaluate how well LLMs and VLMs provide feedback
across symbolic, language, and continuous control environments. We consider
prominent types of feedback for planning including binary feedback, preference
feedback, action advising, goal advising, and delta action feedback. We also
consider inference methods that impact feedback performance, including
in-context learning, chain-of-thought, and access to environment dynamics. We
find that foundation models can provide diverse high-quality feedback across
domains. Moreover, larger and reasoning models consistently provide more
accurate feedback, exhibit less bias, and benefit more from enhanced inference
methods. Finally, feedback quality degrades for environments with complex
dynamics or continuous state spaces and action spaces.

TL;DR: A modular multimodal framework using generative AI to create realistic energy modeling data from publicly accessible residential information and images, reducing dependence on costly or restricted data sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computational energy models require extensive data that is often inaccessible, expensive, or raises privacy concerns, creating barriers to research.

Method: Developed a modular multimodal framework that leverages generative AI to produce labeled energy data from publicly available residential information and images, with an evaluation pipeline for the AI components.

Result: The framework successfully produces realistic, labeled data while avoiding common issues associated with generative models, demonstrating effective data generation capabilities.

Conclusion: This approach paves the way for more accessible and reproducible energy modeling research by reducing reliance on costly or restricted data sources through AI-generated alternatives.

Abstract: Computational models have emerged as powerful tools for energy modeling
research, touting scalability and quantitative results. However, these models
require a plethora of data, some of which is inaccessible, expensive, or raises
privacy concerns. We introduce a modular multimodal framework to produce this
data from publicly accessible residential information and images using
generative artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, we provide a pipeline
demonstrating this framework, and we evaluate its generative AI components. Our
experiments show that our framework's use of AI avoids common issues with
generative models. Our framework produces realistic, labeled data. By reducing
dependence on costly or restricted data sources, we pave a path towards more

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reviews autoformalization - the automation of translating informal input into formal logical representations - across different research areas and proposes a unified framework to accelerate progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid development of autoformalization driven by deep learning and LLMs has occurred in largely independent research areas, limiting opportunities for shared methodologies, benchmarks, and theoretical frameworks that could accelerate progress.

Method: The paper reviews both explicit and implicit instances of autoformalization across different fields and proposes a unified framework to encourage cross-pollination between these research areas.

Result: The review identifies that similar autoformalization tasks are being addressed independently in mathematics (using interactive theorem provers) and broader applications (for reasoning, planning, and knowledge representation) without shared methodologies.

Conclusion: A unified framework for autoformalization is needed to facilitate cross-pollination between different fields and advance the development of next generation AI systems.

Abstract: Autoformalization has emerged as a term referring to the automation of
formalization - specifically, the formalization of mathematics using
interactive theorem provers (proof assistants). Its rapid development has been
driven by progress in deep learning, especially large language models (LLMs).
More recently, the term has expanded beyond mathematics to describe the broader
task of translating informal input into formal logical representations. At the
same time, a growing body of research explores using LLMs to translate informal
language into formal representations for reasoning, planning, and knowledge
representation - often without explicitly referring to this process as
autoformalization. As a result, despite addressing similar tasks, the largely
independent development of these research areas has limited opportunities for
shared methodologies, benchmarks, and theoretical frameworks that could
accelerate progress. The goal of this paper is to review - explicit or implicit
- instances of what can be considered autoformalization and to propose a
unified framework, encouraging cross-pollination between different fields to
advance the development of next generation AI systems.

*Nana Han,Dong Liu,Tomas Norton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An intelligent knowledge assistant system using RAG with structured knowledge processing methods (table textualization and decision-tree textualization) for goat farming health management, achieving 85%+ accuracy across various Q&A tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have limited application in livestock farming due to constraints in knowledge availability, diversity, and complexity of heterogeneous data formats. There's a need to enhance LLMs' understanding of structured agricultural knowledge.

Method: Used Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with two structured knowledge processing methods: table textualization and decision-tree textualization. Established a domain-specific goat farming knowledge base covering five key domains and integrated an online search module for real-time information retrieval.

Result: Heterogeneous knowledge fusion achieved mean accuracies of 87.90% (validation) and 84.22% (test). Accuracy consistently exceeded 85% across text-based, table-based, and decision-tree based Q&A tasks. Omission was identified as the main error category.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates robustness and reliability for practical applications in goat farming, with structured knowledge fusion proving effective within a modular design framework.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being recognised as valuable
knowledge communication tools in many industries. However, their application in
livestock farming remains limited, being constrained by several factors not
least the availability, diversity and complexity of knowledge sources. This
study introduces an intelligent knowledge assistant system designed to support
health management in farmed goats. Leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), two structured knowledge processing methods, table
textualization and decision-tree textualization, were proposed to enhance large
language models' (LLMs) understanding of heterogeneous data formats. Based on
these methods, a domain-specific goat farming knowledge base was established to
improve LLM's capacity for cross-scenario generalization. The knowledge base
spans five key domains: Disease Prevention and Treatment, Nutrition Management,
Rearing Management, Goat Milk Management, and Basic Farming Knowledge.
Additionally, an online search module is integrated to enable real-time
retrieval of up-to-date information. To evaluate system performance, six
ablation experiments were conducted to examine the contribution of each
component. The results demonstrated that heterogeneous knowledge fusion method
achieved the best results, with mean accuracies of 87.90% on the validation set
and 84.22% on the test set. Across the text-based, table-based, decision-tree
based Q&A tasks, accuracy consistently exceeded 85%, validating the
effectiveness of structured knowledge fusion within a modular design. Error
analysis identified omission as the predominant error category, highlighting
opportunities to further improve retrieval coverage and context integration. In
conclusion, the results highlight the robustness and reliability of the
proposed system for practical applications in goat farming.

*Yago Romano Matinez,Jesse Roberts*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can play UNO effectively but struggle to help other players win, with performance varying by model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test whether LLMs can actively assist humans in accomplishing goals, using UNO game as a testbed to evaluate collaborative capabilities.

Method: Built a tool for decoder-only LLMs to participate in RLCard game environment, providing full game-state information and testing with two prompting strategies across models from 1B to 70B parameters.

Result: All models outperformed random baseline when playing UNO themselves, but few models significantly helped another player win the game.

Conclusion: While LLMs can perform well in individual game play, their ability to provide meaningful assistance to human partners remains limited, suggesting challenges in collaborative AI capabilities.

Abstract: LLMs promise to assist humans -- not just by answering questions, but by
offering useful guidance across a wide range of tasks. But how far does that
assistance go? Can a large language model based agent actually help someone
accomplish their goal as an active participant? We test this question by
engaging an LLM in UNO, a turn-based card game, asking it not to win but
instead help another player to do so. We built a tool that allows decoder-only
LLMs to participate as agents within the RLCard game environment. These models
receive full game-state information and respond using simple text prompts under
two distinct prompting strategies. We evaluate models ranging from small (1B
parameters) to large (70B parameters) and explore how model scale impacts
performance. We find that while all models were able to successfully outperform
a random baseline when playing UNO, few were able to significantly aid another
player.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern scientific discovery requires coordinating distributed facilities and heterogeneous resources, forcing researchers to act as manual workflow coordinators rather than focusing on science. AI agents offer opportunities to accelerate discovery but need integration frameworks.

Method: Proposes a conceptual framework where workflows evolve along two dimensions: intelligence (static to intelligent) and composition (single to swarm), charting a path from current workflow systems to fully autonomous distributed scientific laboratories.

Result: Presents an architectural blueprint for the community to take next steps toward autonomous science, enabling transformational scientific workflows.

Conclusion: The framework provides a roadmap for integrating AI agents into scientific ecosystems, potentially enabling 100x acceleration in scientific discovery through autonomous, distributed laboratory systems.

Abstract: Modern scientific discovery increasingly requires coordinating distributed
facilities and heterogeneous resources, forcing researchers to act as manual
workflow coordinators rather than scientists. Advances in AI leading to AI
agents show exciting new opportunities that can accelerate scientific discovery
by providing intelligence as a component in the ecosystem. However, it is
unclear how this new capability would materialize and integrate in the real
world. To address this, we propose a conceptual framework where workflows
evolve along two dimensions which are intelligence (from static to intelligent)
and composition (from single to swarm) to chart an evolutionary path from
current workflow management systems to fully autonomous, distributed scientific
laboratories. With these trajectories in mind, we present an architectural
blueprint that can help the community take the next steps towards harnessing
the opportunities in autonomous science with the potential for 100x discovery
acceleration and transformational scientific workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reformulating WaveFunctionCollapse as a Markov Decision Process to decouple constraint satisfaction from objective optimization, outperforming traditional joint optimization approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Procedural content generation needs to satisfy both designer objectives and tile adjacency constraints, but joint optimization struggles with complexity.

Method: Reformulate WFC as an MDP, allowing external algorithms to focus on objective maximization while WFC handles constraint satisfaction through propagation.

Result: WFC-MDP approach consistently outperforms traditional evolutionary methods across various domains, especially as task complexity increases.

Conclusion: Decoupling local constraint satisfaction from global objective optimization provides significant advantages over joint optimization approaches.

Abstract: Procedural content generation often requires satisfying both
designer-specified objectives and adjacency constraints implicitly imposed by
the underlying tile set. To address the challenges of jointly optimizing both
constraints and objectives, we reformulate WaveFunctionCollapse (WFC) as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling external optimization algorithms to
focus exclusively on objective maximization while leveraging WFC's propagation
mechanism to enforce constraint satisfaction. We empirically compare optimizing
this MDP to traditional evolutionary approaches that jointly optimize global
metrics and local tile placement. Across multiple domains with various
difficulties, we find that joint optimization not only struggles as task
complexity increases, but consistently underperforms relative to optimization
over the WFC-MDP, underscoring the advantages of decoupling local constraint
satisfaction from global objective optimization.

TL;DR: Proposes formal measure for evaluating XAI tools on tabular data using Boolean functions, introduces B-ReX tool that outperforms others on benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of subjective evaluation in explainable AI, particularly for tabular data and Boolean function predictions, by establishing a precise causality-based importance measure.

Method: Extends previous work with formal variable importance measure based on actual causality, evaluates state-of-the-art XAI tools, and develops novel B-ReX tool based on existing ReX framework.

Result: B-ReX demonstrates superior performance over other black-box XAI tools, achieving Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.072 ± 0.012 on random 10-valued Boolean formulae benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed causality-based measure provides objective evaluation framework, and B-ReX emerges as the most effective black-box XAI tool for tabular data with Boolean function predictions.

Abstract: Evaluating explainable AI (XAI) approaches is a challenging task in general,
due to the subjectivity of explanations. In this paper, we focus on tabular
data and the specific use case of AI models predicting the values of Boolean
functions. We extend the previous work in this domain by proposing a formal and
precise measure of importance of variables based on actual causality, and we
evaluate state-of-the-art XAI tools against this measure. We also present a
novel XAI tool B-ReX, based on the existing tool ReX, and demonstrate that it
is superior to other black-box XAI tools on a large-scale benchmark.
Specifically, B-ReX achieves a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.072 $\pm$ 0.012
on random 10-valued Boolean formulae

*Hailong Yang,Renhuo Zhao,Guanjin Wang,Zhaohong Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAMA is a privacy-preserving multi-agent system that separates private and public workspaces, using anonymization and enhancement modules to protect sensitive data while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based multi-agent systems need to handle privacy-sensitive tasks but cannot securely use high-performance LLMs on public servers without privacy protection mechanisms.

Method: Divides workspace into private/public spaces, uses anonymization, and incorporates DRKE (Domain-Rule-based Knowledge Enhancement) and DLE (Disproof-based Logic Enhancement) modules to mitigate semantic loss from anonymization.

Result: Superior performance on Trivia Creative Writing and Logic Grid Puzzle datasets, and exceptional effectiveness on new privacy-focused datasets for both task processing and privacy preservation.

Conclusion: GAMA provides an effective solution for privacy-preserving multi-agent systems that can securely utilize public LLMs while maintaining high task performance through its anonymization and enhancement framework.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM), LLM-based agents
exhibit exceptional abilities in understanding and generating natural language,
facilitating human-like collaboration and information transmission in LLM-based
Multi-Agent System (MAS). High-performance LLMs are often hosted on remote
servers in public spaces. When tasks involve privacy data, MAS cannot securely
utilize these LLMs without implementing privacy-preserving mechanisms. To
address this challenge, we propose a General Anonymizing Multi-Agent system
(GAMA), which divides the agents' workspace into private and public spaces and
protects privacy through the anonymizing mechanism. In the private space,
agents handle sensitive data, while in the public space, only anonymized data
is utilized. GAMA incorporates two key modules to mitigate semantic loss caused
by anonymization: Domain-Rule-based Knowledge Enhancement (DRKE) and
Disproof-based Logic Enhancement (DLE). We evaluate GAMA on two public
question-answering datasets: Trivia Creative Writing and Logic Grid Puzzle. The
results demonstrate that GAMA has superior performance compared to the
state-of-the-art models. To further assess its privacy-preserving capabilities,
we designed two new datasets: Knowledge Privacy Preservation and Logic Privacy
Preservation. The final results highlight GAMA's exceptional effectiveness in
both task processing and privacy preservation.

TL;DR: XAgents is a multi-agent framework that uses a multipolar task processing graph and IF-THEN rules to improve task planning and handle uncertainty in complex tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Agent Systems face challenges in effective task planning for complex tasks with uncertainty, often producing misleading outputs that hinder execution.

Method: Proposes XAgents framework with multipolar task processing graph for dynamic planning and IF-THEN rules to constrain agent behaviors and enhance collaboration.

Result: XAgents consistently surpasses state-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent approaches across three datasets in knowledge-typed and logic-typed QA tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses uncertainty in complex tasks through dynamic planning and rule-based constraints, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in supporting humans
with complex, real-world tasks. However, MAS still face challenges in effective
task planning when handling highly complex tasks with uncertainty, often
resulting in misleading or incorrect outputs that hinder task execution. To
address this, we propose XAgents, a unified multi-agent cooperative framework
built on a multipolar task processing graph and IF-THEN rules. XAgents uses the
multipolar task processing graph to enable dynamic task planning and handle
task uncertainty. During subtask processing, it integrates domain-specific
IF-THEN rules to constrain agent behaviors, while global rules enhance
inter-agent collaboration. We evaluate the performance of XAgents across three
distinct datasets, demonstrating that it consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent approaches in both
knowledge-typed and logic-typed question-answering tasks. The codes for XAgents
are available at: https://github.com/AGI-FHBC/XAgents.

*Sofia Vei,Paolo Giudici,Pavlos Sermpezis,Athena Vakali,Adelaide Emma Bernardelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI Harmonics introduces a human-centric AI risk assessment framework that uses ordinal severity data to prioritize harms, identifying political and physical harms as most urgent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI risk assessment models focus on internal compliance and neglect diverse stakeholder perspectives and real-world consequences, failing to address the unprecedented societal harms introduced by AI dominance.

Method: Proposes AI Harmonics framework with a novel AI harm assessment metric (AIH) that leverages ordinal severity data to capture relative impact without requiring precise numerical estimates. Combines generalized methodology with data-driven, stakeholder-aware framework using annotated incident data.

Result: Experiments confirm political and physical harms exhibit highest concentration - political harms erode public trust while physical harms pose life-threatening risks. AI Harmonics consistently identifies uneven harm distributions.

Conclusion: The framework enables policymakers and organizations to target mitigation efforts effectively by prioritizing the most severe AI harms based on empirical incident data and stakeholder perspectives.

Abstract: The absolute dominance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) introduces
unprecedented societal harms and risks. Existing AI risk assessment models
focus on internal compliance, often neglecting diverse stakeholder perspectives
and real-world consequences. We propose a paradigm shift to a human-centric,
harm-severity adaptive approach grounded in empirical incident data. We present
AI Harmonics, which includes a novel AI harm assessment metric (AIH) that
leverages ordinal severity data to capture relative impact without requiring
precise numerical estimates. AI Harmonics combines a robust, generalized
methodology with a data-driven, stakeholder-aware framework for exploring and
prioritizing AI harms. Experiments on annotated incident data confirm that
political and physical harms exhibit the highest concentration and thus warrant
urgent mitigation: political harms erode public trust, while physical harms
pose serious, even life-threatening risks, underscoring the real-world
relevance of our approach. Finally, we demonstrate that AI Harmonics
consistently identifies uneven harm distributions, enabling policymakers and
organizations to target their mitigation efforts effectively.

*Nenad Tomasev,Matija Franklin,Joel Z. Leibo,Julian Jacobs,William A. Cunningham,Iason Gabriel,Simon Osindero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 'sandbox economy' framework to analyze emerging AI agent economies, characterizing them by origin (emergent vs intentional) and separateness from human economy (permeable vs impermeable). It discusses design choices for steerable AI markets including auction mechanisms, mission economies, and socio-technical infrastructure to ensure safety and alignment with human flourishing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of autonomous AI agents is creating new economic systems that operate beyond human oversight, presenting both unprecedented coordination opportunities and significant risks including systemic economic risk and exacerbated inequality.

Method: The authors propose a conceptual framework (sandbox economy) with two key dimensions: origins (emergent vs intentional) and separateness (permeable vs impermeable). They analyze design choices for steerable AI agent markets including auction mechanisms, AI mission economies, and socio-technical infrastructure.

Result: The analysis suggests our current trajectory points toward spontaneous emergence of a vast, highly permeable AI agent economy. The paper identifies opportunities for unprecedented coordination but also significant challenges requiring proactive design interventions.

Conclusion: Proactive design of steerable agent markets is necessary to ensure the coming technological shift aligns with humanity's long-term collective flourishing, through mechanisms like fair resource allocation, collective goal coordination, and trust infrastructure.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of autonomous AI agents is giving rise to a new economic
layer where agents transact and coordinate at scales and speeds beyond direct
human oversight. We propose the "sandbox economy" as a framework for analyzing
this emergent system, characterizing it along two key dimensions: its origins
(emergent vs. intentional) and its degree of separateness from the established
human economy (permeable vs. impermeable). Our current trajectory points toward
a spontaneous emergence of a vast and highly permeable AI agent economy,
presenting us with opportunities for an unprecedented degree of coordination as
well as significant challenges, including systemic economic risk and
exacerbated inequality. Here we discuss a number of possible design choices
that may lead to safely steerable AI agent markets. In particular, we consider
auction mechanisms for fair resource allocation and preference resolution, the
design of AI "mission economies" to coordinate around achieving collective
goals, and socio-technical infrastructure needed to ensure trust, safety, and
accountability. By doing this, we argue for the proactive design of steerable
agent markets to ensure the coming technological shift aligns with humanity's
long-term collective flourishing.

*Tamir Shazman,Idan Lev-Yehudi,Ron Benchetit,Vadim Indelman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RSS is a new online planning algorithm for Robust MDPs that provides finite-sample performance guarantees and handles model uncertainty efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online planning methods like Sparse Sampling and MCTS suffer from performance degradation and unsafe behaviors when the generative model has approximation errors from limited data. Robust MDPs offer a principled framework but are computationally intensive for real-time use.

Method: Robust Sparse Sampling (RSS) computes robust value functions using Sample Average Approximation (SAA) instead of nominal value functions. It maintains the efficiency of sparse sampling while providing robustness guarantees, with sample and computational complexities independent of state space size.

Result: RSS outperforms standard Sparse Sampling in environments with uncertain dynamics. It provides theoretical performance guarantees and works for infinite or continuous state spaces.

Conclusion: RSS is the first online planning algorithm for RMDPs with finite-sample theoretical guarantees, enabling tractable robust policy computation in real-time settings while handling model uncertainty effectively.

Abstract: Online planning in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) enables agents to make
sequential decisions by simulating future trajectories from the current state,
making it well-suited for large-scale or dynamic environments. Sample-based
methods such as Sparse Sampling and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) are widely
adopted for their ability to approximate optimal actions using a generative
model. However, in practical settings, the generative model is often learned
from limited data, introducing approximation errors that can degrade
performance or lead to unsafe behaviors. To address these challenges, Robust
MDPs (RMDPs) offer a principled framework for planning under model uncertainty,
yet existing approaches are typically computationally intensive and not suited
for real-time use. In this work, we introduce Robust Sparse Sampling (RSS), the
first online planning algorithm for RMDPs with finite-sample theoretical
performance guarantees. Unlike Sparse Sampling, which estimates the nominal
value function, RSS computes a robust value function by leveraging the
efficiency and theoretical properties of Sample Average Approximation (SAA),
enabling tractable robust policy computation in online settings. RSS is
applicable to infinite or continuous state spaces, and its sample and
computational complexities are independent of the state space size. We provide
theoretical performance guarantees and empirically show that RSS outperforms
standard Sparse Sampling in environments with uncertain dynamics.

*Marko Petković,Vlado Menkovski,Sofía Calero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework using LLM-based agents to automate porous materials characterization through autonomous simulation planning, force field assembly, execution, and result interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated characterization of porous materials can accelerate materials discovery but is limited by complex simulation setup and force field selection challenges.

Method: Multi-agent system with LLM-based agents that autonomously understand characterization tasks, plan simulations, assemble force fields, execute RASPA simulations, and interpret results to guide next steps.

Result: Initial evaluations show high correctness and reproducibility, demonstrating the system's capability for autonomous operation.

Conclusion: This approach shows potential for enabling fully autonomous and scalable materials characterization, representing a significant step toward automated materials discovery.

Abstract: Automated characterization of porous materials has the potential to
accelerate materials discovery, but it remains limited by the complexity of
simulation setup and force field selection. We propose a multi-agent framework
in which LLM-based agents can autonomously understand a characterization task,
plan appropriate simulations, assemble relevant force fields, execute them and
interpret their results to guide subsequent steps. As a first step toward this
vision, we present a multi-agent system for literature-informed force field
extraction and automated RASPA simulation setup. Initial evaluations
demonstrate high correctness and reproducibility, highlighting this approach's
potential to enable fully autonomous, scalable materials characterization.

### [133] [Compartmentalised Agentic Reasoning for Clinical NLI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10222)
*Maël Jullien,Lei Xu,Marco Valentino,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CARENLI framework improves clinical NLI performance by separating knowledge access from inference and using specialized solvers for different reasoning families, achieving up to 42% fidelity improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the assumption that scaling data and parameters leads to better structured representations, specifically examining clinical natural language inference where LLMs often default to heuristics instead of proper reasoning.

Method: CARENLI (Compartmentalised Agentic Reasoning for Clinical NLI) routes premise-statement pairs to family-specific solvers and uses a planner, verifier, and refiner to enforce auditable procedures across four reasoning families.

Result: Achieved 98.0% fidelity in Causal Attribution and 81.2% in Risk State Abstraction, with verifiers flagging violations reliably and refiners correcting epistemic errors. Routing/classification identified as main bottleneck.

Conclusion: LLMs retain relevant facts but default to heuristics when inference is underspecified; CARENLI provides a framework for safer, auditable reasoning by making this dissociation explicit.

Abstract: A common assumption holds that scaling data and parameters yields
increasingly structured, generalisable internal representations. We interrogate
this assumption in clinical natural language inference (NLI) by adopting a
benchmark decomposed into four reasoning families, Causal Attribution,
Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction,
and introducing CARENLI, a Compartmentalised Agentic Reasoning for Clinical NLI
that separates knowledge access from principled inference. CARENLI routes each
premise, statement pair to a family specific solver and enforces auditable
procedures via a planner, verifier, and refiner.
  Across four LLMs, CARENLI improves fidelity by up to 42 points, reaching
98.0% in Causal Attribution and 81.2% in Risk State Abstraction. Verifiers flag
violations with near-ceiling reliability, while refiners correct a substantial
share of epistemic errors. Remaining failures cluster in routing, identifying
family classification as the main bottleneck. These results show that LLMs
often retain relevant facts but default to heuristics when inference is
underspecified, a dissociation CARENLI makes explicit while offering a
framework for safer, auditable reasoning.

### [134] [Investigating Language Model Capabilities to Represent and Process Formal Knowledge: A Preliminary Study to Assist Ontology Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10249)
*Hanna Abi Akl*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using formal logical languages instead of natural language improves Small Language Models' reasoning performance for ontology engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language Models have limitations in reasoning capabilities, particularly affecting ontology engineering tasks. The research aims to address these shortcomings by incorporating formal methods.

Method: Conducted preliminary experiments to test the impact of expressing logical problems with different grammars on SLM performance for reasoning tasks, comparing natural language with more compact logical languages.

Result: Findings show that substituting Natural Language with compact logical languages maintains strong reasoning performance while being more efficient.

Conclusion: The results support using formal logical languages to enhance SLM performance in reasoning tasks, providing a foundation for refining SLMs' role in ontology engineering and bootstrapping ontology construction.

Abstract: Recent advances in Language Models (LMs) have failed to mask their
shortcomings particularly in the domain of reasoning. This limitation impacts
several tasks, most notably those involving ontology engineering. As part of a
PhD research, we investigate the consequences of incorporating formal methods
on the performance of Small Language Models (SLMs) on reasoning tasks.
Specifically, we aim to orient our work toward using SLMs to bootstrap ontology
construction and set up a series of preliminary experiments to determine the
impact of expressing logical problems with different grammars on the
performance of SLMs on a predefined reasoning task. Our findings show that it
is possible to substitute Natural Language (NL) with a more compact logical
language while maintaining a strong performance on reasoning tasks and hope to
use these results to further refine the role of SLMs in ontology engineering.

*Eoin O'Doherty,Nicole Weinrauch,Andrew Talone,Uri Klempner,Xiaoyuan Yi,Xing Xie,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study examines moral value biases in large language models, finding consistent preferences for Care/Virtue frameworks and penalization of libertarian choices across 6 LLMs, with reasoning models showing better context sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI systems prioritize moral values and assess prospects for human-AI symbiosis by examining implicit moral preferences in state-of-the-art LLMs.

Method: Quantitative experiment with six LLMs, ranking and scoring outcomes across 18 dilemmas representing five moral frameworks, analyzing effects of model architecture, cultural origin, and explainability.

Result: Strikingly consistent value biases found - Care and Virtue values rated most moral across all models, libertarian choices consistently penalized. Reasoning models showed greater context sensitivity and richer explanations.

Conclusion: Highlights need for explainability and cultural awareness as critical design principles to guide AI toward transparent, aligned, and symbiotic future with human moral values.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing at a pace that raises urgent
questions about how to align machine decision-making with human moral values.
This working paper investigates how leading AI systems prioritize moral
outcomes and what this reveals about the prospects for human-AI symbiosis. We
address two central questions: (1) What moral values do state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) implicitly favour when confronted with dilemmas? (2) How
do differences in model architecture, cultural origin, and explainability
affect these moral preferences? To explore these questions, we conduct a
quantitative experiment with six LLMs, ranking and scoring outcomes across 18
dilemmas representing five moral frameworks. Our findings uncover strikingly
consistent value biases. Across all models, Care and Virtue values outcomes
were rated most moral, while libertarian choices were consistently penalized.
Reasoning-enabled models exhibited greater sensitivity to context and provided
richer explanations, whereas non-reasoning models produced more uniform but
opaque judgments. This research makes three contributions: (i) Empirically, it
delivers a large-scale comparison of moral reasoning across culturally distinct
LLMs; (ii) Theoretically, it links probabilistic model behaviour with
underlying value encodings; (iii) Practically, it highlights the need for
explainability and cultural awareness as critical design principles to guide AI
toward a transparent, aligned, and symbiotic future.

### [136] [State Algebra for Propositional Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10326)
*Dmitry Lesnik,Tobias Schäfer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: State Algebra is a novel algebraic framework for representing and manipulating propositional logic through three hierarchical representations (Set, Coordinate, Row Decomposition) that provides flexibility in representation while enabling efficient computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a flexible algebraic framework for propositional logic that can represent logical states in multiple ways and support both search-based algorithms and knowledge compilation techniques, while also extending to probabilistic logic applications.

Method: Develops a hierarchy of three representations: Set, Coordinate, and Row Decomposition. Uses algebraic methods for computation and shows that while default reduction isn't canonical, applying fixed variable ordering achieves canonicity. Explores trade-offs between canonicity and representation flexibility.

Result: The framework provides increased flexibility in representation that can lead to more compact problem representations for certain classes. It enables articulation of both search-based and knowledge compilation algorithms and naturally extends to probabilistic logic and Weighted Model Counting.

Conclusion: State Algebra offers a powerful algebraic approach to propositional logic manipulation with flexible representation choices, trading guaranteed canonicity for potentially more compact representations and broader algorithmic applications including probabilistic extensions.

Abstract: This paper presents State Algebra, a novel framework designed to represent
and manipulate propositional logic using algebraic methods. The framework is
structured as a hierarchy of three representations: Set, Coordinate, and Row
Decomposition. These representations anchor the system in well-known semantics
while facilitating the computation using a powerful algebraic engine. A key
aspect of State Algebra is its flexibility in representation. We show that
although the default reduction of a state vector is not canonical, a unique
canonical form can be obtained by applying a fixed variable order during the
reduction process. This highlights a trade-off: by foregoing guaranteed
canonicity, the framework gains increased flexibility, potentially leading to
more compact representations of certain classes of problems. We explore how
this framework provides tools to articulate both search-based and knowledge
compilation algorithms and discuss its natural extension to probabilistic logic
and Weighted Model Counting.

### [137] [Abduct, Act, Predict: Scaffolding Causal Inference for Automated Failure Attribution in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10401)
*Alva West,Yixuan Weng,Minjun Zhu,Zhen Lin,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A2P Scaffolding is a novel framework that transforms failure attribution from pattern recognition to structured causal inference, achieving 2.85x improvement in step-level accuracy over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current failure attribution methods in multi-agent systems have critically low step-level accuracy (below 17%) due to inability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning, making them impractical for debugging complex systems.

Method: Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P) Scaffolding - a three-step reasoning process: (1) Abduction to infer hidden root causes, (2) Action to define minimal corrective intervention, (3) Prediction to simulate subsequent trajectory and verify if intervention resolves failure.

Result: On Algorithm-Generated dataset: 47.46% step-level accuracy (2.85x improvement over 16.67% baseline). On Hand-Crafted dataset: 29.31% step accuracy (2.43x improvement over 12.07% baseline).

Conclusion: By reframing failure attribution through a causal lens, A2P Scaffolding provides a robust, verifiable, and significantly more accurate solution for automated failure attribution in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Failure attribution in multi-agent systems -- pinpointing the exact step
where a decisive error occurs -- is a critical yet unsolved challenge. Current
methods treat this as a pattern recognition task over long conversation logs,
leading to critically low step-level accuracy (below 17\%), which renders them
impractical for debugging complex systems. Their core weakness is a fundamental
inability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if
correcting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To
bridge this counterfactual inference gap, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P)
Scaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from
pattern recognition into a structured causal inference task. A2P explicitly
guides a large language model through a formal three-step reasoning process
within a single inference pass: (1) Abduction, to infer the hidden root causes
behind an agent's actions; (2) Action, to define a minimal corrective
intervention; and (3) Prediction, to simulate the subsequent trajectory and
verify if the intervention resolves the failure. This structured approach
leverages the holistic context of the entire conversation while imposing a
rigorous causal logic on the model's analysis. Our extensive experiments on the
Who\&When benchmark demonstrate its efficacy. On the Algorithm-Generated
dataset, A2P achieves 47.46\% step-level accuracy, a 2.85$\times$ improvement
over the 16.67\% of the baseline. On the more complex Hand-Crafted dataset, it
achieves 29.31\% step accuracy, a 2.43$\times$ improvement over the baseline's
12.07\%. By reframing the problem through a causal lens, A2P Scaffolding
provides a robust, verifiable, and significantly more accurate solution for
automated failure attribution.

### [138] [Mutual Information Tracks Policy Coherence in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10423)
*Cameron Reid,Wael Hafez,Amirhossein Nazeri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Information-theoretic framework for RL anomaly detection using mutual information patterns to diagnose sensor/actuator faults without performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL agents lack intrinsic mechanisms to detect and diagnose real-world deployment failures like sensor faults, actuator wear, and environmental shifts.

Method: Analyze state-action mutual information patterns in robotic control tasks, examining MI(S,A) growth and MI(S,A;S') inverted U-curve patterns during learning, and conduct controlled perturbation experiments.

Result: Successful learning shows MI(S,A) increasing from 0.84 to 2.83 bits (238% growth) despite state entropy growth. Observation-space noise causes broad information collapse, while action-space noise selectively disrupts action-outcome predictability.

Conclusion: Information metrics provide differential diagnostic capability for fault localization without architectural changes, enabling autonomous fault detection and policy adjustment in adaptive RL systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents deployed in real-world environments face
degradation from sensor faults, actuator wear, and environmental shifts, yet
lack intrinsic mechanisms to detect and diagnose these failures. We present an
information-theoretic framework that reveals both the fundamental dynamics of
RL and provides practical methods for diagnosing deployment-time anomalies.
Through analysis of state-action mutual information patterns in a robotic
control task, we first demonstrate that successful learning exhibits
characteristic information signatures: mutual information between states and
actions steadily increases from 0.84 to 2.83 bits (238% growth) despite growing
state entropy, indicating that agents develop increasingly selective attention
to task-relevant patterns. Intriguingly, states, actions and next states joint
mutual information, MI(S,A;S'), follows an inverted U-curve, peaking during
early learning before declining as the agent specializes suggesting a
transition from broad exploration to efficient exploitation. More immediately
actionable, we show that information metrics can differentially diagnose system
failures: observation-space, i.e., states noise (sensor faults) produces broad
collapses across all information channels with pronounced drops in state-action
coupling, while action-space noise (actuator faults) selectively disrupts
action-outcome predictability while preserving state-action relationships. This
differential diagnostic capability demonstrated through controlled perturbation
experiments enables precise fault localization without architectural
modifications or performance degradation. By establishing information patterns
as both signatures of learning and diagnostic for system health, we provide the
foundation for adaptive RL systems capable of autonomous fault detection and
policy adjustment based on information-theoretic principles.
