To bridge the\ngap between LLM safety and legal compliance, we first develop a new benchmark\nfor safety compliance by generating realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with\nlegal statutes. Subsequently, we align Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) to construct a safety reasoner, Compliance Reasoner, which effectively\naligns LLMs with legal standards to mitigate safety risks.

We use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation.\nWe moreover present an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline designed to\nsupport multilingual, task-diverse benchmarking of any combination of LLMs and\ndatasets, with a particular focus on legal tasks, including classification,\nsummarization, open questions, and general reasoning. Our findings confirm that\nlegal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below\n50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on\ngeneral-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields\nmore stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt\nsensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across\nlanguages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a\nlanguage and its syntactic similarity to English.

Among them, next scale\nprediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated\nremarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,\nwe revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a\nMarkovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete\ndiffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with\nDiscrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR\ntransformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how\none can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative\nrefinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster\nconvergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.\nAcross multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR\nleads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper shows that autoregressive transformers with Markovian attention masks are mathematically equivalent to discrete diffusion models, enabling integration of diffusion advantages like iterative refinement into VAR for improved efficiency and generation quality.", "motivation": "To bridge autoregressive transformers and diffusion models by uncovering their mathematical equivalence, allowing VAR to benefit from diffusion techniques like iterative refinement while maintaining computational efficiency.", "method": "Reinterpret VAR with Markovian attention masks as discrete diffusion (termed SRDD), enabling direct import of diffusion advantages such as iterative refinement and architectural optimizations into the VAR framework.", "result": "The diffusion-based perspective of VAR leads to faster convergence, lower inference cost, improved zero-shot reconstruction, and consistent gains in efficiency and generation quality across multiple datasets.", "conclusion": "Establishing the mathematical equivalence between VAR with Markovian attention and discrete diffusion provides a principled bridge that enables combining the strengths of both approaches for superior visual generation performance."}}

Meanwhile,\nlarge-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,\nmaking them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we\nintroduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from\ndiffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural\nmodifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these\nfeatures, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning\nboth images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention\nmagnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.\nMoreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers\nand show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary\ntokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose\nan attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition\nbackground activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more\nlocalized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple\ntraining-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS\nhandling, and redistribution.
