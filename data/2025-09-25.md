### [1] [Vision-Based Perception for Autonomous Vehicles in Off-Road Environment Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19378)
*Nelson Alves Ferreira Neto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CMSNet, a configurable modular segmentation network for real-time obstacle and drivable ground detection on unpaved/off-road terrain, with validation on new Kamino dataset containing 12,000 images from adverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for low-latency intelligent systems for autonomous driving on non-uniform terrain in mining and developing countries, particularly for navigating rough terrain without predefined trails.

Method: Developed Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework with different architectural arrangements, trained for semantic segmentation of obstacles and trafficable ground. Used TensorRT, C++, and CUDA for real-time inference optimization. Created Kamino dataset with 12,000 synchronized camera images from adverse conditions.

Result: System achieved real-time semantic segmentation performance validated on two datasets, with Kamino dataset providing extensive labeled pixel data from off-road proving ground emulating mine conditions.

Conclusion: CMSNet framework effectively enables autonomous vehicle perception on unpaved/off-road environments, with demonstrated capability to handle adverse visibility conditions and operate in real-time.

Abstract: Low-latency intelligent systems are required for autonomous driving on
non-uniform terrain in open-pit mines and developing countries. This work
proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and
off-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined
trail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is
proposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet
configurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new
images from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain,
dust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions
without explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility
impairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A
new dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating
vehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number
of labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images
from an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility. To
achieve real-time inference, CMSNet CNN layers were methodically removed and
fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Empirical experiments on two datasets
validated the proposed system's effectiveness.

### [2] [Overview of LifeCLEF Plant Identification task 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19402)
*Herve Goeau,Pierre Bonnet,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The LifeCLEF 2020 Plant Identification challenge aimed to improve automated plant identification in biodiversity-rich but data-deficient tropical regions by leveraging herbarium collections, using a cross-domain classification approach where herbarium sheets were used for training and field photos for testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated plant identification systems are biased toward North America and Western Europe due to abundant training data, while biodiversity-rich tropical regions lack sufficient field photos. Herbarium collections contain centuries of systematically stored plant specimens from these regions, providing a potential solution to bridge this data gap.

Method: The challenge used a cross-domain classification approach where the training set consisted of hundreds of thousands of herbarium sheets and a few thousand field photos to learn mapping between domains. The test set was exclusively composed of field photos from South America's Guiana Shield region, focusing on about 1,000 species.

Result: The paper presents the evaluation resources and assessments, summarizes participating research groups' approaches, and provides analysis of main outcomes, though specific performance metrics are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: Herbarium collections can potentially enhance automated plant identification in data-deficient tropical regions by providing extensive training data, addressing the geographical bias in current plant identification systems.

Abstract: Automated identification of plants has improved considerably thanks to the
recent progress in deep learning and the availability of training data with
more and more photos in the field. However, this profusion of data only
concerns a few tens of thousands of species, mostly located in North America
and Western Europe, much less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity
such as tropical countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists
have collected, catalogued and systematically stored plant specimens in
herbaria, particularly in tropical regions, and the recent efforts by the
biodiversity informatics community made it possible to put millions of
digitized sheets online. The LifeCLEF 2020 Plant Identification challenge (or
"PlantCLEF 2020") was designed to evaluate to what extent automated
identification on the flora of data deficient regions can be improved by the
use of herbarium collections. It is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species
mainly focused on the South America's Guiana Shield, an area known to have one
of the greatest diversity of plants in the world. The challenge was evaluated
as a cross-domain classification task where the training set consist of several
hundred thousand herbarium sheets and few thousand of photos to enable learning
a mapping between the two domains. The test set was exclusively composed of
photos in the field. This paper presents the resources and assessments of the
conducted evaluation, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the
participating research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

### [3] [iFinder: Structured Zero-Shot Vision-Based LLM Grounding for Dash-Cam Video Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19552)
*Manyi Yao,Bingbing Zhuang,Sparsh Garg,Amit Roy-Chowdhury,Christian Shelton,Manmohan Chandraker,Abhishek Aich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iFinder is a structured semantic grounding framework that translates dash-cam videos into hierarchical data structures for LLMs, enabling better spatial reasoning and causal inference in driving video analysis without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models struggle with spatial reasoning and explainability in dash-cam video analysis due to lack of domain-specific inductive biases and structured representations.

Method: Modular, training-free pipeline using pretrained vision models to extract object pose, lane positions, and trajectories, organized hierarchically with a three-block prompting strategy for step-wise reasoning.

Result: Significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot driving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: iFinder provides a zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for post-hoc driving video understanding through domain-specific grounding.

Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks like post-hoc
dash-cam driving video analysis is challenging due to their general-purpose
training and lack of structured inductive biases. As vision is often the sole
modality available for such analysis (i.e., no LiDAR, GPS, etc.), existing
video-based vision-language models (V-VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning,
causal inference, and explainability of events in the input video. To this end,
we introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples
perception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical,
interpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular,
training-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract
critical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which
are hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures. Combined
with a three-block prompting strategy, it enables step-wise, grounded reasoning
for the LLM to refine a peer V-VLM's outputs and provide accurate reasoning.
Evaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that iFinder's
proposed grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and
global context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot
driving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy. By
grounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations, iFinder offers a
zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for
post-hoc driving video understanding.

### [4] [CURE: Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure for Facial Recognition Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19562)
*Fnu Shivam,Nima Najafzadeh,Yenumula Reddy,Prashnna Gyawali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CURE is the first unsupervised machine unlearning framework for facial recognition that removes targeted user data without identity labels, outperforming existing methods and introducing a new evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in facial recognition by enabling data removal without identity labels, which are often unavailable in privacy-constrained or noisy datasets.

Method: Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure (CURE) framework that operates without identity labels, using centroid guidance to selectively remove specific user data while preserving model performance.

Result: CURE significantly outperforms unsupervised variants of existing unlearning methods and demonstrates effective quality-aware unlearning by removing low-quality images.

Conclusion: CURE provides an effective unsupervised solution for privacy-preserving facial recognition, with the novel UES metric offering better evaluation of unlearning efficiency, highlighting image quality's role in machine unlearning.

Abstract: In the current digital era, facial recognition systems offer significant
utility and have been widely integrated into modern technological
infrastructures; however, their widespread use has also raised serious privacy
concerns, prompting regulations that mandate data removal upon request. Machine
unlearning has emerged as a powerful solution to address this issue by
selectively removing the influence of specific user data from trained models
while preserving overall model performance. However, existing machine
unlearning techniques largely depend on supervised techniques requiring
identity labels, which are often unavailable in privacy-constrained situations
or in large-scale, noisy datasets. To address this critical gap, we introduce
CURE (Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure), the first
unsupervised unlearning framework for facial recognition systems that operates
without the use of identity labels, effectively removing targeted samples while
preserving overall performance. We also propose a novel metric, the Unlearning
Efficiency Score (UES), which balances forgetting and retention stability,
addressing shortcomings in the current evaluation metrics. CURE significantly
outperforms unsupervised variants of existing unlearning methods. Additionally,
we conducted quality-aware unlearning by designating low-quality images as the
forget set, demonstrating its usability and benefits, and highlighting the role
of image quality in machine unlearning.

### [5] [Synthesizing Artifact Dataset for Pixel-level Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19589)
*Dennis Menn,Feng Liang,Diana Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an artifact corruption pipeline that automatically injects artifacts into clean synthetic images to generate pixel-level annotations, eliminating the need for expensive manual labeling and improving artifact detector performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training artifact detectors requires expensive pixel-level human annotations, and lack of annotated data limits detector performance. Naive pseudo-labeling approaches suffer from noisy labels.

Method: An artifact corruption pipeline that automatically injects artifacts into clean, high-quality synthetic images on predetermined regions, producing pixel-level annotations without manual labeling.

Result: Achieves performance improvements of 13.2% for ConvNeXt and 3.7% for Swin-T artifact detectors compared to baseline approaches, as verified on human-labeled data.

Conclusion: This work represents an initial step toward scalable pixel-level artifact annotation datasets that integrate world knowledge into artifact detection.

Abstract: Artifact detectors have been shown to enhance the performance of
image-generative models by serving as reward models during fine-tuning. These
detectors enable the generative model to improve overall output fidelity and
aesthetics. However, training the artifact detector requires expensive
pixel-level human annotations that specify the artifact regions. The lack of
annotated data limits the performance of the artifact detector. A naive
pseudo-labeling approach-training a weak detector and using it to annotate
unlabeled images-suffers from noisy labels, resulting in poor performance. To
address this, we propose an artifact corruption pipeline that automatically
injects artifacts into clean, high-quality synthetic images on a predetermined
region, thereby producing pixel-level annotations without manual labeling. The
proposed method enables training of an artifact detector that achieves
performance improvements of 13.2% for ConvNeXt and 3.7% for Swin-T, as verified
on human-labeled data, compared to baseline approaches. This work represents an
initial step toward scalable pixel-level artifact annotation datasets that
integrate world knowledge into artifact detection.

### [6] [Parameter-Efficient Multi-Task Learning via Progressive Task-Specific Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19602)
*Neeraj Gangwar,Anshuka Rangi,Rishabh Deshmukh,Holakou Rahmanian,Yesh Dattatreya,Nickvash Kani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Progressive task-specific multi-task adaptation is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that introduces adapter modules that are shared across tasks in early layers and become progressively more task-specific in later layers, with task similarity-based allocation to reduce interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address task interference and negative transfer in parameter-efficient multi-task learning by allowing shared learning in initial layers and task-specific adaptation in later layers.

Method: Introduces progressive adapter modules in pre-trained models, with shared adapters in early layers and task-specific adapters in later layers. Uses gradient-based task similarity computation to allocate similar tasks to shared adapter modules.

Result: Outperforms fully fine-tuned multi-task models while using only one-fifth of trainable parameters. Achieves better relative improvement to single-task fine-tuning and surpasses state-of-the-art methods on PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed progressive task-specific adaptation effectively reduces task conflicts in multi-task learning while maintaining parameter efficiency, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have emerged as a promising solution
for adapting pre-trained models to various downstream tasks. While these
methods perform well in single-task learning, extending them to multi-task
learning exacerbates common challenges, such as task interference and negative
transfer, due to the limited number of trainable parameters. To address these
issues, we introduce progressive task-specific multi-task adaptation, a novel
parameter-efficient approach for multi-task learning. This approach introduces
adapter modules in a pre-trained model such that these modules are shared
across all tasks in the initial layers and become progressively more
task-specific in the later layers. The motivation is to reduce the conflicts
among tasks by allowing transfer learning across all tasks in the initial
layers and enabling task-specific learning toward the prediction heads.
Additionally, we propose a gradient-based approach for computing task
similarity and use this measure to allocate similar tasks to the shared adapter
modules. Our task similarity method introduces minimal overhead in the
pipeline. We evaluate our approach by adapting the Swin Transformer for dense
prediction tasks. Experiments on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms a fully fine-tuned multi-task model while
requiring only one-fifth of the trainable parameters. This approach achieves
better relative improvement to single-task fine-tuning while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and surpasses the current state-of-the-art
methods for parameter-efficient multi-task learning.

### [7] [Raw-JPEG Adapter: Efficient Raw Image Compression with JPEG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19624)
*Mahmoud Afifi,Ran Zhang,Michael S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RawJPEG Adapter is a learnable, invertible preprocessing pipeline that adapts raw images for standard JPEG compression, enabling accurate raw reconstruction while maintaining high compression efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raw data preserves full sensor information but requires large storage (DNG format), while JPEG offers high compression but is unsuitable for raw storage. There's a need for a solution that combines JPEG's efficiency with raw data preservation.

Method: A lightweight, learnable, and invertible preprocessing pipeline that applies spatial and optional frequency-domain transforms to raw images before JPEG compression. Compact parameters are stored in the JPEG comment field to enable accurate reconstruction.

Result: Experiments show higher fidelity than direct JPEG storage, support for other codecs, and favorable trade-off between compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: RawJPEG Adapter provides an effective solution for storing raw-like information in JPEG format, offering practical benefits for constrained scenarios while maintaining reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Digital cameras digitize scene light into linear raw representations, which
the image signal processor (ISP) converts into display-ready outputs. While raw
data preserves full sensor information--valuable for editing and vision
tasks--formats such as Digital Negative (DNG) require large storage, making
them impractical in constrained scenarios. In contrast, JPEG is a widely
supported format, offering high compression efficiency and broad compatibility,
but it is not well-suited for raw storage. This paper presents RawJPEG Adapter,
a lightweight, learnable, and invertible preprocessing pipeline that adapts raw
images for standard JPEG compression. Our method applies spatial and optional
frequency-domain transforms, with compact parameters stored in the JPEG comment
field, enabling accurate raw reconstruction. Experiments across multiple
datasets show that our method achieves higher fidelity than direct JPEG
storage, supports other codecs, and provides a favorable trade-off between
compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy.

### [8] [The Impact of 2D Segmentation Backbones on Point Cloud Predictions Using 4D Radar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19644)
*William L. Muckelroy III,Mohammed Alsakabi,John M. Dolan,Ozan K. Tonguz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Investigating the impact of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on LiDAR-like 3D point cloud generation from 4D Radars, finding that optimal backbone selection can provide 23.7% improvement over SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR's high cost restricts broad adoption in autonomous driving systems, so researchers aim to create LiDAR-like point clouds using cheaper 4D Radars instead.

Method: Using higher-capacity segmentation backbones with neural networks trained on LiDAR point clouds as ground truth to generate 3D point clouds from 4D Radar data.

Result: While very high-capacity models may hurt performance, an optimal segmentation backbone provides 23.7% improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Careful selection of segmentation backbone capacity is crucial for optimal performance in generating LiDAR-like point clouds from 4D Radar data.

Abstract: LiDAR's dense, sharp point cloud (PC) representations of the surrounding
environment enable accurate perception and significantly improve road safety by
offering greater scene awareness and understanding. However, LiDAR's high cost
continues to restrict the broad adoption of high-level Autonomous Driving (AD)
systems in commercially available vehicles. Prior research has shown progress
towards circumventing the need for LiDAR by training a neural network, using
LiDAR point clouds as ground truth (GT), to produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds
using only 4D Radars. One of the best examples is a neural network created to
train a more efficient radar target detector with a modular 2D convolutional
neural network (CNN) backbone and a temporal coherence network at its core that
uses the RaDelft dataset for training (see arXiv:2406.04723). In this work, we
investigate the impact of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on the quality
of the produced point clouds. Our results show that while very high-capacity
models may actually hurt performance, an optimal segmentation backbone can
provide a 23.7% improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA).

### [9] [Bias in the Picture: Benchmarking VLMs with Social-Cue News Images and LLM-as-Judge Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19659)
*Aravind Narayanan,Vahid Reza Khazaie,Shaina Raza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a news-image benchmark to evaluate social bias in vision-language models, finding that visual context systematically shifts model outputs and bias prevalence varies across attributes with high risk for gender and occupation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models can absorb and reproduce harmful social stereotypes when visual cues like age, gender, race, clothing, or occupation are present, creating risks that need systematic investigation.

Method: Created a benchmark of 1,343 image-question pairs from diverse news outlets, annotated with ground-truth answers and demographic attributes. Evaluated state-of-the-art VLMs using an LLM as judge with human verification.

Result: Visual context systematically shifts model outputs in open-ended settings; bias prevalence varies across attributes and models (particularly high risk for gender and occupation); higher faithfulness doesn't necessarily correspond to lower bias.

Conclusion: The study reveals significant bias risks in VLMs and releases the benchmark, evaluation rubric, and code to support reproducible and fairness-aware multimodal assessment.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) can jointly interpret images and text,
but they are also prone to absorbing and reproducing harmful social stereotypes
when visual cues such as age, gender, race, clothing, or occupation are
present. To investigate these risks, we introduce a news-image benchmark
consisting of 1,343 image-question pairs drawn from diverse outlets, which we
annotated with ground-truth answers and demographic attributes (age, gender,
race, occupation, and sports). We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art VLMs and
employ a large language model (LLM) as judge, with human verification. Our
findings show that: (i) visual context systematically shifts model outputs in
open-ended settings; (ii) bias prevalence varies across attributes and models,
with particularly high risk for gender and occupation; and (iii) higher
faithfulness does not necessarily correspond to lower bias. We release the
benchmark prompts, evaluation rubric, and code to support reproducible and
fairness-aware multimodal assessment.

### [10] [MoTiC: Momentum Tightness and Contrast for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19664)
*Zeyu He,Shuai Huang,Yuwu Lu,Ming Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MoTiC, a framework for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning that reduces new-class prototype estimation bias through Bayesian prior alignment and enhances feature tightness via large-scale contrastive learning with momentum self-supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSCIL methods suffer from significant estimation bias in new-class prototypes due to extreme data scarcity, while base-class prototypes benefit from sufficient data. This imbalance leads to suboptimal performance in incremental learning scenarios.

Method: Proposes MoTiC framework that: 1) Aligns new-class priors with old-class statistics using Bayesian analysis to reduce variance, 2) Uses large-scale contrastive learning for cross-category feature tightness, 3) Integrates momentum self-supervision and virtual categories to enrich feature diversity and inject prior information.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on three FSCIL benchmarks, with particularly strong results on fine-grained CUB-200 task, demonstrating reduced estimation bias and improved incremental learning robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian prior alignment and contrastive learning framework effectively addresses prototype estimation bias in FSCIL, enabling more robust incremental learning with scarce new-class samples while maintaining old-class knowledge.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) must contend with the dual
challenge of learning new classes from scarce samples while preserving old
class knowledge. Existing methods use the frozen feature extractor and
class-averaged prototypes to mitigate against catastrophic forgetting and
overfitting. However, new-class prototypes suffer significant estimation bias
due to extreme data scarcity, whereas base-class prototypes benefit from
sufficient data. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that aligning the
new-class priors with old-class statistics via Bayesian analysis reduces
variance and improves prototype accuracy. Furthermore, we propose large-scale
contrastive learning to enforce cross-category feature tightness. To further
enrich feature diversity and inject prior information for new-class prototypes,
we integrate momentum self-supervision and virtual categories into the Momentum
Tightness and Contrast framework (MoTiC), constructing a feature space with
rich representations and enhanced interclass cohesion. Experiments on three
FSCIL benchmarks produce state-of-the-art performances, particularly on the
fine-grained task CUB-200, validating our method's ability to reduce estimation
bias and improve incremental learning robustness.

### [11] [Deep Learning for Clouds and Cloud Shadow Segmentation in Methane Satellite and Airborne Imaging Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19665)
*Manuel Perez-Carrasco,Maya Nasr,Sebastien Roche,Chris Chan Miller,Zhan Zhang,Core Francisco Park,Eleanor Walker,Cecilia Garraffo,Douglas Finkbeiner,Ritesh Gautam,Steven Wofsy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Machine learning methods for cloud and cloud shadow detection in hyperspectral remote sensing data, comparing conventional techniques with deep learning architectures to improve methane emission quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective cloud and cloud shadow detection is critical for accurate atmospheric methane retrieval in hyperspectral remote sensing, particularly for MethaneSAT and MethaneAIR missions, as clouds bias methane retrievals and impact emission quantification.

Method: Deployed and evaluated conventional techniques (Iterative Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron) against advanced deep learning architectures (UNet and Spectral Channel Attention Network) for cloud and cloud shadow detection in high-resolution satellite imagery.

Result: Conventional methods struggled with spatial coherence and boundary definition. Deep learning models substantially improved detection quality: UNet performed best in preserving spatial structure, while SCAN excelled at capturing fine boundary details and surpassed UNet on MethaneSAT data.

Conclusion: Advanced deep learning architectures provide robust, scalable solutions for cloud and cloud shadow screening, enhancing methane emission quantification capacity for hyperspectral missions. SCAN's spectral attention mechanism is particularly beneficial for satellite-specific features.

Abstract: Effective cloud and cloud shadow detection is a critical prerequisite for
accurate retrieval of concentrations of atmospheric methane or other trace
gases in hyperspectral remote sensing. This challenge is especially pertinent
for MethaneSAT and for its airborne companion mission, MethaneAIR. In this
study, we use machine learning methods to address the cloud and cloud shadow
detection problem for sensors with these high spatial resolutions instruments.
Cloud and cloud shadows in remote sensing data need to be effectively screened
out as they bias methane retrievals in remote sensing imagery and impact the
quantification of emissions. We deploy and evaluate conventional techniques
including Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP),
with advanced deep learning architectures, namely UNet and a Spectral Channel
Attention Network (SCAN) method. Our results show that conventional methods
struggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition, affecting the
detection of clouds and cloud shadows. Deep learning models substantially
improve detection quality: UNet performs best in preserving spatial structure,
while SCAN excels at capturing fine boundary details. Notably, SCAN surpasses
UNet on MethaneSAT data, underscoring the benefits of incorporating spectral
attention for satellite specific features. This in depth assessment of various
disparate machine learning techniques demonstrates the strengths and
effectiveness of advanced deep learning architectures in providing robust,
scalable solutions for clouds and cloud shadow screening towards enhancing
methane emission quantification capacity of existing and next generation
hyperspectral missions. Our data and code is publicly available at

*Sumit Mamtani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes two lightweight optimization techniques (STA and ANF) to reduce structured noise artifacts in Vision Transformers' feature maps, improving interpretability for downstream tasks like segmentation and depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers show superior performance but suffer from structured noise artifacts in feature maps that hinder downstream applications such as segmentation and depth estimation.

Method: Two architecture-agnostic techniques: Structured Token Augmentation (STA) enhances token diversity through spatial perturbations during tokenization, and Adaptive Noise Filtering (ANF) applies learnable inline denoising between transformer layers.

Result: Experimental results across ImageNet, Ade20k, and NYUv2 benchmarks show consistent improvements in visual quality and task performance.

Conclusion: The proposed methods are practically effective for improving Vision Transformers' feature quality and interpretability for downstream applications.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance across a
wide range of computer vision tasks. However, structured noise artifacts in
their feature maps hinder downstream applications such as segmentation and
depth estimation. We propose two novel and lightweight optimisation techniques-
Structured Token Augmentation (STA) and Adaptive Noise Filtering (ANF)- to
improve interpretability and mitigate these artefacts. STA enhances token
diversity through spatial perturbations during tokenisation, while ANF applies
learnable inline denoising between transformer layers. These methods are
architecture-agnostic and evaluated across standard benchmarks, including
ImageNet, Ade20k, and NYUv2. Experimental results show consistent improvements
in visual quality and task performance, highlighting the practical
effectiveness of our approach.

### [13] [From Prompt to Progression: Taming Video Diffusion Models for Seamless Attribute Transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19690)
*Ling Lo,Kelvin C. K. Chan,Wen-Huang Cheng,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to improve video generation models for smooth attribute transitions using frame-wise guidance during denoising, with a new benchmark and metrics for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with gradual attribute transitions in videos, often producing inconsistencies when using prompt interpolation methods.

Method: Proposes frame-wise guidance during denoising that constructs transitional directions for each noisy latent, guiding gradual attribute shifts while preserving motion dynamics. Also introduces CAT-Bench benchmark with new metrics.

Result: Experimental results show the approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving visual fidelity, text alignment, and seamless attribute transitions.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles gradual attribute transitions in video generation, with released code and benchmark to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Existing models often struggle with complex temporal changes, particularly
when generating videos with gradual attribute transitions. The most common
prompt interpolation approach for motion transitions often fails to handle
gradual attribute transitions, where inconsistencies tend to become more
pronounced. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to extend
existing models for smooth and consistent attribute transitions, through
introducing frame-wise guidance during the denoising process. Our approach
constructs a data-specific transitional direction for each noisy latent,
guiding the gradual shift from initial to final attributes frame by frame while
preserving the motion dynamics of the video. Moreover, we present the
Controlled-Attribute-Transition Benchmark (CAT-Bench), which integrates both
attribute and motion dynamics, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of
different models. We further propose two metrics to assess the accuracy and
smoothness of attribute transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach performs favorably against existing baselines, achieving visual
fidelity, maintaining alignment with text prompts, and delivering seamless
attribute transitions. Code and CATBench are released:

### [14] [Anatomically Constrained Transformers for Cardiac Amyloidosis Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19691)
*Alexander Thorley,Agis Chartsias,Jordan Strom,Roberto Lang,Jeremy Slivnick,Jamie O'Driscoll,Rajan Sharma,Dipak Kotecha,Jinming Duan,Alberto Gomez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transformer model constrained to the myocardium region achieves better cardiac amyloidosis classification than full video transformers by focusing on clinically relevant anatomical features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural network approaches for cardiac amyloidosis detection process entire echocardiogram videos without ensuring classification is based on clinically relevant features known to be associated with the disease.

Method: The authors constrain a transformer model to the myocardium region by embedding it as deforming points and corresponding sampled image patches into input tokens. They also apply this anatomical constraint to self-supervised learning masked autoencoder pre-training by masking and reconstructing only anatomical patches.

Result: The anatomically constrained transformer model achieves increased performance on cardiac amyloidosis classification compared to full video transformers.

Conclusion: Constraining both the transformer and pre-training task to the myocardium where cardiac amyloidosis imaging features are localized provides better classification performance and explicit guarantees that classification focuses only on anatomical regions, while enabling visualization of transformer attention scores.

Abstract: Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a rare cardiomyopathy, with typical abnormalities
in clinical measurements from echocardiograms such as reduced global
longitudinal strain of the myocardium. An alternative approach for detecting CA
is via neural networks, using video classification models such as convolutional
neural networks. These models process entire video clips, but provide no
assurance that classification is based on clinically relevant features known to
be associated with CA. An alternative paradigm for disease classification is to
apply models to quantitative features such as strain, ensuring that the
classification relates to clinically relevant features. Drawing inspiration
from this approach, we explicitly constrain a transformer model to the
anatomical region where many known CA abnormalities occur -- the myocardium,
which we embed as a set of deforming points and corresponding sampled image
patches into input tokens. We show that our anatomical constraint can also be
applied to the popular self-supervised learning masked autoencoder
pre-training, where we propose to mask and reconstruct only anatomical patches.
We show that by constraining both the transformer and pre-training task to the

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning method for selecting optimal subsets of echocardiographic clips to maximize disease classification performance while reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated methods for echocardiographic disease classification either use single clips (ignoring complementary information) or all clips (computationally expensive), creating a need for an efficient clip selection approach.

Method: Reinforcement learning agent that learns to either keep processing view-specific clips to reduce classification uncertainty or stop when sufficient confidence is achieved, combined with a learnable attention-based aggregation method for fusing information from multiple clips.

Result: Achieved AUC of 0.91 for detecting cardiac amyloidosis using only 30% of all clips, exceeding performance from using all clips and other benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances computational efficiency and classification performance by intelligently selecting optimal clip subsets through reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Guidelines for transthoracic echocardiographic examination recommend the
acquisition of multiple video clips from different views of the heart,
resulting in a large number of clips. Typically, automated methods, for
instance disease classifiers, either use one clip or average predictions from
all clips. Relying on one clip ignores complementary information available from
other clips, while using all clips is computationally expensive and may be
prohibitive for clinical adoption.
  To select the optimal subset of clips that maximize performance for a
specific task (image-based disease classification), we propose a method
optimized through reinforcement learning. In our method, an agent learns to
either keep processing view-specific clips to reduce the disease classification
uncertainty, or stop processing if the achieved classification confidence is
sufficient. Furthermore, we propose a learnable attention-based aggregation
method as a flexible way of fusing information from multiple clips. The
proposed method obtains an AUC of 0.91 on the task of detecting cardiac
amyloidosis using only 30% of all clips, exceeding the performance achieved
from using all clips and from other benchmarks.

TL;DR: SynthICL is a domain randomization-based data synthesis framework that generates diverse medical image data for in-context learning segmentation, addressing data scarcity while maintaining anatomical realism and distribution suitability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of In-Context Learning (ICL) for medical image segmentation creates unprecedented demand for large-scale diverse datasets, exacerbating data scarcity problems. Existing synthesis methods fail to simultaneously achieve high diversity and suitable medical domain distribution.

Method: Built on domain randomization, SynthICL leverages anatomical priors from real datasets to ensure realism, generates diverse anatomical structures for broad data distribution, and explicitly models inter-subject variations to create suitable ICL data cohorts.

Result: Extensive experiments on four held-out datasets show models trained with SynthICL data achieve up to 63% average Dice improvement and substantially enhanced generalization to unseen anatomical domains.

Conclusion: SynthICL helps mitigate the data bottleneck for ICL-based segmentation, paving the way for robust models. The framework and generated dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: The rise of In-Context Learning (ICL) for universal medical image
segmentation has introduced an unprecedented demand for large-scale, diverse
datasets for training, exacerbating the long-standing problem of data scarcity.
While data synthesis offers a promising solution, existing methods often fail
to simultaneously achieve both high data diversity and a domain distribution
suitable for medical data. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{SynthICL}, a
novel data synthesis framework built upon domain randomization. SynthICL
ensures realism by leveraging anatomical priors from real-world datasets,
generates diverse anatomical structures to cover a broad data distribution, and
explicitly models inter-subject variations to create data cohorts suitable for
ICL. Extensive experiments on four held-out datasets validate our framework's
effectiveness, showing that models trained with our data achieve performance
gains of up to 63\% in average Dice and substantially enhanced generalization
to unseen anatomical domains. Our work helps mitigate the data bottleneck for
ICL-based segmentation, paving the way for robust models. Our code and the
generated dataset are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIMD is a monocular visual-inertial motion and depth learning framework that estimates dense metric depth by leveraging MSCKF-based motion tracking and iteratively refining per-pixel scale using multi-view information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and efficient dense metric depth estimation is crucial for 3D visual perception in robotics and XR applications, requiring practical solutions for resource-constrained settings.

Method: The framework exploits multi-view information to iteratively refine per-pixel scale rather than globally fitting an invariant affine model. It's highly modular and compatible with various depth estimation backbones, using MSCKF-based monocular visual-inertial motion tracking.

Result: VIMD achieves exceptional accuracy and robustness, even with extremely sparse points (10-20 metric depth points per image), demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization on AR Table dataset after evaluations on TartanAir and VOID datasets.

Conclusion: VIMD is a practical solution for deployment in resource-constrained settings with robust performance and strong generalization capabilities across various scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient dense metric depth estimation is crucial for 3D visual
perception in robotics and XR. In this paper, we develop a monocular
visual-inertial motion and depth (VIMD) learning framework to estimate dense
metric depth by leveraging accurate and efficient MSCKF-based monocular
visual-inertial motion tracking. At the core the proposed VIMD is to exploit
multi-view information to iteratively refine per-pixel scale, instead of
globally fitting an invariant affine model as in the prior work. The VIMD
framework is highly modular, making it compatible with a variety of existing
depth estimation backbones. We conduct extensive evaluations on the TartanAir
and VOID datasets and demonstrate its zero-shot generalization capabilities on
the AR Table dataset. Our results show that VIMD achieves exceptional accuracy
and robustness, even with extremely sparse points as few as 10-20 metric depth
points per image. This makes the proposed VIMD a practical solution for
deployment in resource constrained settings, while its robust performance and
strong generalization capabilities offer significant potential across a wide
range of scenarios.

*Bo Yu,Jianhua Yang,Zetao Du,Yan Huang,Chenglong Li,Liang Wang*

TL;DR: FMISeg is a frequency-domain multi-modal interaction model that improves medical image segmentation by integrating clinical text reports with visual features in the frequency domain to enhance lesion representation and suppress irrelevant information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex lesion morphology and the semantic gap between vision-language modalities, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance in pulmonary infectious disease diagnosis.

Method: A late fusion model with Frequency-domain Feature Bidirectional Interaction (FFBI) module for visual feature enhancement and Language-guided Frequency-domain Feature Interaction (LFFI) module for semantic guidance-based feature suppression.

Result: Experiments on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ datasets show superior qualitative and quantitative performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FMISeg effectively bridges the vision-language gap in medical image segmentation through frequency-domain multi-modal interaction, achieving better segmentation accuracy for pulmonary infectious diseases.

Abstract: Automatically segmenting infected areas in radiological images is essential
for diagnosing pulmonary infectious diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated
that the accuracy of the medical image segmentation can be improved by
incorporating clinical text reports as semantic guidance. However, the complex
morphological changes of lesions and the inherent semantic gap between
vision-language modalities prevent existing methods from effectively enhancing
the representation of visual features and eliminating semantically irrelevant
information, ultimately resulting in suboptimal segmentation performance. To
address these problems, we propose a Frequency-domain Multi-modal Interaction
model (FMISeg) for language-guided medical image segmentation. FMISeg is a late
fusion model that establishes interaction between linguistic features and
frequency-domain visual features in the decoder. Specifically, to enhance the
visual representation, our method introduces a Frequency-domain Feature
Bidirectional Interaction (FFBI) module to effectively fuse frequency-domain
features. Furthermore, a Language-guided Frequency-domain Feature Interaction
(LFFI) module is incorporated within the decoder to suppress semantically
irrelevant visual features under the guidance of linguistic information.
Experiments on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ demonstrated that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based methods offer fast novel view rendering but lag behind implicit neural representations in reconstruction quality for surfaces with complex reflective properties.

Method: Integrates polarimetric constraints into the 3DGS framework to effectively separate specular and diffuse components, enhancing reconstruction quality for challenging reflective materials.

Result: Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the method for fast reflective surface reconstruction.

Conclusion: PolGS successfully addresses the limitations of 3DGS for reflective surfaces by incorporating polarimetric constraints, achieving high-quality reconstruction in just 10 minutes.

Abstract: Efficient shape reconstruction for surfaces with complex reflectance
properties is crucial for real-time virtual reality. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS)-based methods offer fast novel view rendering by leveraging
their explicit surface representation, their reconstruction quality lags behind
that of implicit neural representations, particularly in the case of recovering
surfaces with complex reflective reflectance. To address these problems, we
propose PolGS, a Polarimetric Gaussian Splatting model allowing fast reflective
surface reconstruction in 10 minutes. By integrating polarimetric constraints
into the 3DGS framework, PolGS effectively separates specular and diffuse
components, enhancing reconstruction quality for challenging reflective
materials. Experimental results on the synthetic and real-world dataset
validate the effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAMILA is a context-aware image editing method that validates instruction coherence with images, ignoring infeasible requests to prevent nonsensical output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing models naively follow all user instructions, even infeasible or contradictory ones, leading to poor results. There's a need for context-aware validation.

Method: CAMILA uses context-aware masking to validate coherence between instructions and images, applying only relevant edits to designated regions while ignoring non-executable instructions.

Result: The method achieves better performance and higher semantic alignment than state-of-the-art models, effectively handling complex instruction challenges while preserving image integrity.

Conclusion: CAMILA demonstrates significant improvement in handling infeasible instructions and maintaining contextual coherence in text-guided image editing.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing has been allowing users to transform and synthesize
images through natural language instructions, offering considerable
flexibility. However, most existing image editing models naively attempt to
follow all user instructions, even if those instructions are inherently
infeasible or contradictory, often resulting in nonsensical output. To address
these challenges, we propose a context-aware method for image editing named as
CAMILA (Context-Aware Masking for Image Editing with Language Alignment).
CAMILA is designed to validate the contextual coherence between instructions
and the image, ensuring that only relevant edits are applied to the designated
regions while ignoring non-executable instructions. For comprehensive
evaluation of this new method, we constructed datasets for both single- and
multi-instruction image editing, incorporating the presence of infeasible
requests. Our method achieves better performance and higher semantic alignment
than state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling
complex instruction challenges while preserving image integrity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFPTrack is a parameter-efficient RGB-Thermal tracking method that combines spatial and frequency-domain prompts using Fast Fourier Transform for better modality feature extraction and fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT-based RGB-T tracking methods rely only on spatial domain information, overlooking the importance of frequency-domain information which limits optimal performance.

Method: Uses symmetric feature extraction with shared parameters, visual Fourier prompts via FFT, and a Modality Fusion Prompt Generator that creates bidirectional interaction prompts through multi-modal feature fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments on three RGB-T tracking benchmarks show outstanding performance.

Conclusion: The proposed VFPTrack method effectively leverages both spatial and frequency-domain information for improved RGB-T tracking performance through comprehensive modality feature interaction.

Abstract: Recently, visual prompt tuning is introduced to RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) tracking
as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method. However, these PEFT-based
RGB-T tracking methods typically rely solely on spatial domain information as
prompts for feature extraction. As a result, they often fail to achieve optimal
performance by overlooking the crucial role of frequency-domain information in
prompt learning. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier
Prompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature
extraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality
Fusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts
through multi-modal feature fusion. Specifically, we first use a frozen feature
extraction encoder to extract RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modality features.
Then, we combine the visual prompts in the spatial domain with the frequency
domain prompts obtained from the FFT, which allows for the full extraction and
understanding of modality features from different domain information. Finally,
unlike previous fusion methods, the modality fusion prompt generation module we
use combines features from different modalities to generate a fused modality
prompt. This modality prompt is interacted with each individual modality to
fully enable feature interaction across different modalities. Extensive
experiments conducted on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks show that our
method demonstrates outstanding performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RD³ proposes a standardized evaluation protocol for decoupled dataset distillation methods, revealing that performance differences across existing methods stem more from inconsistent evaluation procedures than methodological advances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decoupled dataset distillation methods suffer from inconsistent post-evaluation protocols, which hinders fair comparisons and progress in the field.

Method: Proposes Rectified Decoupled Dataset Distillation (RD³) and systematically investigates how different post-evaluation settings affect test accuracy, establishing a standardized benchmark.

Result: Analysis reveals that much performance variation is attributed to inconsistent evaluation rather than intrinsic quality of synthetic data, and identifies general strategies that improve distilled datasets.

Conclusion: RD³ provides a foundation for fair and reproducible comparisons in future dataset distillation research by establishing standardized evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to generate compact synthetic datasets that enable
models trained on them to achieve performance comparable to those trained on
full real datasets, while substantially reducing storage and computational
costs. Early bi-level optimization methods (e.g., MTT) have shown promising
results on small-scale datasets, but their scalability is limited by high
computational overhead. To address this limitation, recent decoupled dataset
distillation methods (e.g., SRe$^2$L) separate the teacher model pre-training
from the synthetic data generation process. These methods also introduce random
data augmentation and epoch-wise soft labels during the post-evaluation phase
to improve performance and generalization. However, existing decoupled
distillation methods suffer from inconsistent post-evaluation protocols, which
hinders progress in the field. In this work, we propose Rectified Decoupled
Dataset Distillation (RD$^3$), and systematically investigate how different
post-evaluation settings affect test accuracy. We further examine whether the
reported performance differences across existing methods reflect true
methodological advances or stem from discrepancies in evaluation procedures.
Our analysis reveals that much of the performance variation can be attributed
to inconsistent evaluation rather than differences in the intrinsic quality of
the synthetic data. In addition, we identify general strategies that improve
the effectiveness of distilled datasets across settings. By establishing a
standardized benchmark and rigorous evaluation protocol, RD$^3$ provides a
foundation for fair and reproducible comparisons in future dataset distillation
research.

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised learning framework called nnFilterMatch that integrates SSL with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering within nnU-Net, achieving comparable performance to fully supervised models with only 5-20% labeled data while eliminating retraining loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational overhead and scalability limitations of conventional SSL-AL hybrid approaches that require iterative retraining cycles after each annotation round in medical image segmentation.

Method: Integrates SSL with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering (FilterMatch) within the single-pass nnU-Net training framework, selectively excluding high-confidence pseudo-labels during training to avoid retraining loops while maintaining uncertainty-guided learning benefits.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to or exceeding fully supervised models across multiple clinical segmentation benchmarks using only 5-20% labeled data.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, end-to-end learning strategy that significantly reduces annotation demands in medical image segmentation without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in medical
image segmentation, offering competitive performance while substantially
reducing the need for extensive manual annotation. When combined with active
learning (AL), these strategies further minimize annotation burden by
selectively incorporating the most informative samples. However, conventional
SSL_AL hybrid approaches often rely on iterative and loop-based retraining
cycles after each annotation round, incurring significant computational
overhead and limiting scalability in clinical applications. In this study, we
present a novel, annotation-efficient, and self-adaptive deep segmentation
framework that integrates SSL with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering
(FilterMatch), an AL-inspired mechanism, within the single-pass nnU-Net
training segmentation framework (nnFilterMatch). By selectively excluding
high-confidence pseudo-labels during training, our method circumvents the need
for retraining loops while preserving the benefits of uncertainty-guided
learning. We validate the proposed framework across multiple clinical
segmentation benchmarks and demonstrate that it achieves performance comparable
to or exceeding fully supervised models, even with only 5\%--20\% labeled data.
This work introduces a scalable, end-to-end learning strategy for reducing
annotation demands in medical image segmentation without compromising accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve fine-grained expression control in talking head generation using physically grounded, per-frame expression control through explicit AU-to-landmark mapping, addressing limitations of prior methods that rely on emotion labels or implicit AU conditioning.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Variational motion generator predicts temporally coherent landmark sequences from audio and AU intensities; 2) Diffusion-based synthesizer generates realistic videos conditioned on landmarks and reference image. Separates motion and appearance modeling.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on MEAD dataset across multiple metrics, demonstrating superior expression accuracy, temporal stability, and visual realism.

Conclusion: Explicit AU-to-landmark modeling is effective for expressive talking head generation, providing improved control and quality compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: We propose a two-stage framework for audio-driven talking head generation
with fine-grained expression control via facial Action Units (AUs). Unlike
prior methods relying on emotion labels or implicit AU conditioning, our model
explicitly maps AUs to 2D facial landmarks, enabling physically grounded,
per-frame expression control. In the first stage, a variational motion
generator predicts temporally coherent landmark sequences from audio and AU
intensities. In the second stage, a diffusion-based synthesizer generates
realistic, lip-synced videos conditioned on these landmarks and a reference
image. This separation of motion and appearance improves expression accuracy,
temporal stability, and visual realism. Experiments on the MEAD dataset show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics,
demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit AU-to-landmark modeling for
expressive talking head generation.

*Jinhui Zheng,Xueyuan Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExpFace is a new margin-based softmax loss for face recognition that introduces an angular exponential term to better handle noisy samples by applying larger penalties to clean samples in the center region and smaller penalties to noisy samples in the peripheral region.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing margin-based softmax losses (SphereFace, CosFace, ArcFace) enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability but overlook the impact of noisy samples. The authors observed that clean samples cluster in the center region while noisy samples shift toward the peripheral region in angular space.

Method: Proposed Exponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace) which uses an angular exponential term as the margin. This design applies larger penalties in the center region and smaller penalties in the peripheral region, emphasizing clean samples while suppressing noisy samples.

Result: ExpFace achieves state-of-the-art performance, avoids training instability of SphereFace and non-monotonicity of ArcFace, and exhibits similarity curves that align with decision boundaries in angular space.

Conclusion: ExpFace provides an effective solution for handling noisy samples in face recognition by adaptively applying penalties based on sample location in angular space, outperforming existing margin-based softmax losses.

Abstract: Face recognition is an open-set problem requiring high discriminative power
to ensure that intra-class distances remain smaller than inter-class distances.
Margin-based softmax losses, such as SphereFace, CosFace, and ArcFace, have
been widely adopted to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, yet they overlook the impact of noisy samples. By examining the
distribution of samples in the angular space, we observe that clean samples
predominantly cluster in the center region, whereas noisy samples tend to shift
toward the peripheral region. Motivated by this observation, we propose the
Exponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace), which introduces an angular
exponential term as the margin. This design applies a larger penalty in the
center region and a smaller penalty in the peripheral region within the angular
space, thereby emphasizing clean samples while suppressing noisy samples. We
present a unified analysis of ExpFace and classical margin-based softmax losses
in terms of margin embedding forms, similarity curves, and gradient curves,
showing that ExpFace not only avoids the training instability of SphereFace and
the non-monotonicity of ArcFace, but also exhibits a similarity curve that
applies penalties in the same manner as the decision boundary in the angular
space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpFace achieves state-of-the-art
performance. To facilitate future research, we have released the source code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLM-based document parsing methods lack explicit analytical stages for document layouts and reading orders, limiting their capability in handling complex document types like multi-column newspapers or posters.

Method: Proposes Logics-Parsing: an end-to-end LVLM-based model augmented with reinforcement learning with carefully designed reward mechanisms to optimize layout analysis and reading order inference. Also incorporates diverse data types (chemical formulas, handwritten Chinese characters) in supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on LogicsParsingBench (1,078 page-level PDF images across 9 categories) validate the model's efficacy and State-of-the-art performance across diverse document analysis scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed Logics-Parsing model successfully addresses limitations of current LVLM approaches by incorporating reinforcement learning for layout analysis and reading order optimization, demonstrating superior performance on complex document types.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Vision-Language models (LVLM) have spurred
significant progress in document parsing task. Compared to traditional
pipeline-based methods, end-to-end paradigms have shown their excellence in
converting PDF images into structured outputs through integrated Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), table recognition, mathematical formula
recognition and so on. However, the absence of explicit analytical stages for
document layouts and reading orders limits the LVLM's capability in handling
complex document types such as multi-column newspapers or posters. To address
this limitation, we propose in this report Logics-Parsing: an end-to-end
LVLM-based model augmented with reinforcement learning. Our model incorporates
meticulously designed reward mechanisms to optimize complex layout analysis and
reading order inference. In addition, we expand the model's versatility by
incorporating diverse data types such as chemical formulas and handwritten
Chinese characters into supervised fine-tuning. Finally, to enable rigorous
evaluation of our approach, we introduce LogicsParsingBench, a curated set of

### [27] [Sex-based Bias Inherent in the Dice Similarity Coefficient: A Model Independent Analysis for Multiple Anatomical Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19778)
*Hartmut Häntze,Myrthe Buser,Alessa Hering,Lisa C. Adams,Keno K. Bressem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study reveals that the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) metric itself introduces sex-based bias in medical image segmentation evaluation, as it penalizes errors more heavily in smaller structures, which disproportionately affects women due to their smaller average organ volumes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work examined sex-based differences in models or datasets, but no study had investigated the potential bias introduced by the DSC metric itself. The researchers wanted to quantify how the DSC's inherent properties create systematic differences between men and women independent of specific segmentation models.

Method: Applied equally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants to ensure sex-based comparability. Used an idealized setting independent of specific models to isolate the metric's effect.

Result: Even minimal errors (e.g., 1 mm boundary shift) produced systematic DSC differences between sexes. Small structures showed average DSC differences around 0.03; medium-sized structures around 0.01. Only large structures (lungs and liver) were mostly unaffected with sex-based differences close to zero.

Conclusion: Fairness studies using DSC should not expect identical scores between men and women, as the metric itself introduces bias. A segmentation model may perform equally well across sexes in terms of error magnitude, even if observed DSC values suggest otherwise. This awareness is essential for more accurate and fair evaluations in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Overlap-based metrics such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) penalize
segmentation errors more heavily in smaller structures. As organ size differs
by sex, this implies that a segmentation error of equal magnitude may result in
lower DSCs in women due to their smaller average organ volumes compared to men.
While previous work has examined sex-based differences in models or datasets,
no study has yet investigated the potential bias introduced by the DSC itself.
This study quantifies sex-based differences of the DSC and the normalized DSC
in an idealized setting independent of specific models. We applied
equally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants
to ensure sex-based comparability. Even minimal errors (e.g., a 1 mm boundary
shift) produced systematic DSC differences between sexes. For small structures,
average DSC differences were around 0.03; for medium-sized structures around
0.01. Only large structures (i.e., lungs and liver) were mostly unaffected,
with sex-based DSC differences close to zero. These findings underline that
fairness studies using the DSC as an evaluation metric should not expect
identical scores between men and women, as the metric itself introduces bias. A
segmentation model may perform equally well across sexes in terms of error
magnitude, even if observed DSC values suggest otherwise. Importantly, our work
raises awareness of a previously underexplored source of sex-based differences
in segmentation performance. One that arises not from model behavior, but from
the metric itself. Recognizing this factor is essential for more accurate and
fair evaluations in medical image analysis.

TL;DR: A lightweight Vision Transformer architecture for HDR imaging that achieves ghost-free reconstruction with significant computational efficiency gains for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality HDR imaging on resource-constrained edge devices is challenging due to computational costs and ghosting artifacts in existing Multi-Exposure Fusion methods.

Method: Uses Context-Aware Vision Transformer with YCbCr color space conversion, Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion for ghost suppression, and lightweight components including Inverted Residual Embedding, Dynamic Tanh, and Enhanced Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution.

Result: Main version reduces FLOPS by 67%, increases inference speed by 5x on CPU and 2.5x on edge devices, while maintaining high visual quality.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient, ghost-free HDR imaging solution suitable for edge devices with versatility across dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Achieving high-quality High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging on
resource-constrained edge devices is a critical challenge in computer vision,
as its performance directly impacts downstream tasks such as intelligent
surveillance and autonomous driving. Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a
mainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally
face the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts,
hindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a
light-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR
reconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the
Context-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the
YCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then
employs an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress
ghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce
Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced
Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at
multiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main
version for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in
computational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between
performance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared
to the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and
increases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge

ghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and
practicality across various dynamic scenarios.

### [29] [BiTAA: A Bi-Task Adversarial Attack for Object Detection and Depth Estimation via 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19793)
*Yixun Zhang,Feng Zhou,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiTAA is a bi-task adversarial attack framework that generates a single perturbation capable of simultaneously degrading object detection and biasing monocular depth estimation in autonomous driving perception systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D/3D adversarial attacks operate in task silos, lack mechanisms for controllable depth bias, and have no standardized protocol to quantify cross-task transfer between detection and depth estimation, leaving their interaction underexplored.

Method: Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting, BiTAA uses a dual-model attack framework with composite loss that couples detection suppression with signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth bias within ROIs. Supports full-image/patch settings and optional EOT for physical reality.

Result: The attack shows consistent cross-task degradation and reveals a clear asymmetry in transfer between detection-to-depth and depth-to-detection tasks, highlighting practical risks for multi-task camera-only perception.

Conclusion: BiTAA demonstrates significant vulnerabilities in multi-task perception systems and motivates the need for cross-task-aware defenses in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Camera-based perception is critical to autonomous driving yet remains
vulnerable to task-specific adversarial manipulations in object detection and
monocular depth estimation. Most existing 2D/3D attacks are developed in task
silos, lack mechanisms to induce controllable depth bias, and offer no
standardized protocol to quantify cross-task transfer, leaving the interaction
between detection and depth underexplored. We present BiTAA, a bi-task
adversarial attack built on 3D Gaussian Splatting that yields a single
perturbation capable of simultaneously degrading detection and biasing
monocular depth. Specifically, we introduce a dual-model attack framework that
supports both full-image and patch settings and is compatible with common
detectors and depth estimators, with optional expectation-over-transformation
(EOT) for physical reality. In addition, we design a composite loss that
couples detection suppression with a signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth
bias within regions of interest (ROIs) enabling controllable near or far
misperception while maintaining stable optimization across tasks. We also
propose a unified evaluation protocol with cross-task transfer metrics and
real-world evaluations, showing consistent cross-task degradation and a clear
asymmetry between Det to Depth and from Depth to Det transfer. The results
highlight practical risks for multi-task camera-only perception and motivate
cross-task-aware defenses in autonomous driving scenarios.

*Shantanusinh Parmar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StrCGAN is a generative model that enhances low-resolution astrophotography images by reconstructing high-fidelity representations of celestial objects, overcoming limitations of traditional CycleGAN models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reconstructing high-quality celestial object images from low-resolution small-telescope observations, as traditional models like CycleGAN are limited to 2D mappings and often distort stellar morphology.

Method: Extends CycleGAN with three key innovations: 3D convolutional layers for volumetric spatial correlations, multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared domains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar morphology, using ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys.

Result: StrCGAN generates reconstructions that are visually sharper and physically consistent, outperforming standard GAN models in astrophysical image enhancement.

Conclusion: The proposed StrCGAN framework successfully enhances low-resolution astrophotography images while maintaining physical consistency across spectral bands, representing a significant improvement over existing GAN-based approaches for astrophysical applications.

Abstract: We introduce StrCGAN (Stellar Cyclic GAN), a generative model designed to
enhance low-resolution astrophotography images. Our goal is to reconstruct
high-fidelity ground truth-like representations of celestial objects, a task
that is challenging due to the limited resolution and quality of
small-telescope observations such as the MobilTelesco dataset. Traditional
models such as CycleGAN provide a foundation for image-to-image translation but
are restricted to 2D mappings and often distort the morphology of stars and
galaxies. To overcome these limitations, we extend the CycleGAN framework with
three key innovations: 3D convolutional layers to capture volumetric spatial
correlations, multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared (NIR)
domains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar
morphology. Ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys spanning
optical to NIR guide the training process, ensuring that reconstructions remain
consistent across spectral bands. Together, these components allow StrCGAN to
generate reconstructions that are not only visually sharper but also physically
consistent, outperforming standard GAN models in the task of astrophysical
image enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Meta-weight-ensembler is a meta-learning-based approach that adaptively generates layer-specific mixing coefficients for model ensemble in continual learning, addressing knowledge conflicts at both task and layer levels to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model ensemble methods in continual learning suffer from knowledge conflict issues at task and layer levels, which compromise learning performance in both old and new tasks.

Method: The method employs a mixing coefficient generator trained via meta-learning to generate appropriate mixing coefficients for model ensemble, with coefficients individually generated for each layer to address layer-level knowledge conflicts.

Result: Experiments on multiple continual learning datasets show that meta-weight-ensembler effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Meta-weight-ensembler can be flexibly combined with existing continual learning methods to boost their ability to alleviate catastrophic forgetting, providing an effective solution for adaptive knowledge fusion in continual learning.

Abstract: Model ensemble is an effective strategy in continual learning, which
alleviates catastrophic forgetting by interpolating model parameters, achieving
knowledge fusion learned from different tasks. However, existing model ensemble
methods usually encounter the knowledge conflict issue at task and layer
levels, causing compromised learning performance in both old and new tasks. To
solve this issue, we propose meta-weight-ensembler that adaptively fuses
knowledge of different tasks for continual learning. Concretely, we employ a
mixing coefficient generator trained via meta-learning to generate appropriate
mixing coefficients for model ensemble to address the task-level knowledge
conflict. The mixing coefficient is individually generated for each layer to
address the layer-level knowledge conflict. In this way, we learn the prior
knowledge about adaptively accumulating knowledge of different tasks in a fused
model, achieving efficient learning in both old and new tasks.
Meta-weight-ensembler can be flexibly combined with existing continual learning
methods to boost their ability of alleviating catastrophic forgetting.
Experiments on multiple continual learning datasets show that
meta-weight-ensembler effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current embodied AI agents struggle to model individual human preferences and behaviors, making deployment in human-centered scenarios like domestic households challenging.

Method: The benchmark comprises over 2,000 episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from HM3D dataset, featuring natural-language queries with explicit object-owner associations. It supports two evaluation modes: active navigation in unseen environments and object grounding in mapped scenes.

Result: Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines show a substantial performance gap compared to human performance.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and memorizing personalized information, paving the way for real-world assistive robots.

Abstract: Recent advances in Embodied AI have enabled agents to perform increasingly
complex tasks and adapt to diverse environments. However, deploying such agents
in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains
challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human
preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized
Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study
personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to
objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries
such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality
episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode
includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations
between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific
semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation
in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes.
Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human
performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving,
reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards

TL;DR: FreezeVLA is a novel attack framework that exploits adversarial vulnerabilities in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, causing them to ignore instructions and effectively "freeze" robotic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models are advancing robotics but their safety against adversarial attacks remains underexplored. The paper identifies a critical vulnerability where adversarial images can disconnect robots' digital processing from physical actions.

Method: Proposes FreezeVLA attack framework using min-max bi-level optimization to generate action-freezing attacks. Evaluated on three state-of-the-art VLA models across four robotic benchmarks.

Result: FreezeVLA achieves 76.2% average attack success rate, significantly outperforming existing methods. Adversarial images show strong transferability, with single images reliably paralyzing systems across diverse prompts.

Conclusion: The research exposes critical safety risks in VLA models and highlights urgent need for robust defense mechanisms against such adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are driving rapid progress in robotics by
enabling agents to interpret multimodal inputs and execute complex,
long-horizon tasks. However, their safety and robustness against adversarial
attacks remain largely underexplored. In this work, we identify and formalize a
critical adversarial vulnerability in which adversarial images can "freeze" VLA
models and cause them to ignore subsequent instructions. This threat
effectively disconnects the robot's digital mind from its physical actions,
potentially inducing inaction during critical interventions. To systematically
study this vulnerability, we propose FreezeVLA, a novel attack framework that
generates and evaluates action-freezing attacks via min-max bi-level
optimization. Experiments on three state-of-the-art VLA models and four robotic
benchmarks show that FreezeVLA attains an average attack success rate of 76.2%,
significantly outperforming existing methods. Moreover, adversarial images
generated by FreezeVLA exhibit strong transferability, with a single image
reliably inducing paralysis across diverse language prompts. Our findings
expose a critical safety risk in VLA models and highlight the urgent need for
robust defense mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive edge-cloud collaborative object detection method using MLLMs to enhance semantic understanding in complex scenes, achieving significant latency and computational cost reductions while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional object detection methods struggle in complex scenarios like low-light conditions and heavy occlusions due to insufficient high-level semantic understanding.

Method: Uses instruction fine-tuning on MLLMs to generate structured scene descriptions, implements adaptive mapping to convert semantic information into parameter adjustment signals for edge detectors, and employs edge-cloud collaborative inference with confidence-based selection between cloud guidance and edge detection.

Result: The method reduces latency by over 79% and computational cost by 70% in low-light and highly occluded scenes while maintaining detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive guidance-based semantic enhancement approach effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in complex object detection scenarios.

Abstract: Traditional object detection methods face performance degradation challenges
in complex scenarios such as low-light conditions and heavy occlusions due to a
lack of high-level semantic understanding. To address this, this paper proposes
an adaptive guidance-based semantic enhancement edge-cloud collaborative object
detection method leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), achieving
an effective balance between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, the method
first employs instruction fine-tuning to enable the MLLM to generate structured
scene descriptions. It then designs an adaptive mapping mechanism that
dynamically converts semantic information into parameter adjustment signals for
edge detectors, achieving real-time semantic enhancement. Within an edge-cloud
collaborative inference framework, the system automatically selects between
invoking cloud-based semantic guidance or directly outputting edge detection
results based on confidence scores. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method effectively enhances detection accuracy and efficiency in complex
scenes. Specifically, it can reduce latency by over 79% and computational cost
by 70% in low-light and highly occluded scenes while maintaining accuracy.

### [36] [Generalized Shortest Path-based Superpixels for 3D Spherical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19895)
*Rémi Giraud,Rodrigo Borba Pinheiro,Yannick Berthoumieu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SphSPS is a new superpixel method for 360° spherical images that respects 3D spherical geometry, improving segmentation accuracy and shape regularity compared to planar and spherical state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard superpixel methods are designed for planar images and don't handle the distortions in wide-angle 360° spherical/omnidirectional images properly, creating a need for dedicated approaches that respect the spherical geometry.

Method: The method generalizes the notion of shortest path between pixels and superpixel centers using spherical geometry, and introduces a global regularity metric adapted to spherical space. It computes shortest paths on the 3D spherical acquisition space to extract relevant clustering features.

Result: SphSPS significantly outperforms both planar and spherical state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy, robustness to noise, and regularity on 360° spherical panorama datasets and synthetic road omnidirectional images.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective tool for superpixel-based applications on 360° images by properly handling spherical geometry, addressing limitations of existing approaches designed for planar images.

Abstract: The growing use of wide angle image capture devices and the need for fast and
accurate image analysis in computer visions have enforced the need for
dedicated under-representation approaches. Most recent decomposition methods
segment an image into a small number of irregular homogeneous regions, called
superpixels. Nevertheless, these approaches are generally designed to segment
standard 2D planar images, i.e., captured with a 90o angle view without
distortion. In this work, we introduce a new general superpixel method called
SphSPS (for Spherical Shortest Path-based Superpixels)1 , dedicated to wide
360o spherical or omnidirectional images. Our method respects the geometry of
the 3D spherical acquisition space and generalizes the notion of shortest path
between a pixel and a superpixel center, to fastly extract relevant clustering
features. We demonstrate that considering the geometry of the acquisition space
to compute the shortest path enables to jointly improve the segmentation
accuracy and the shape regularity of superpixels. To evaluate this regularity
aspect, we also generalize a global regularity metric to the spherical space,
addressing the limitations of the only existing spherical compactness measure.
Finally, the proposed SphSPS method is validated on the reference 360o
spherical panorama segmentation dataset and on synthetic road omnidirectional
images. Our method significantly outperforms both planar and spherical
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy,robustness to
noise and regularity, providing a very interesting tool for superpixel-based
applications on 360o images.

TL;DR: CWA-MSN is a novel representation learning framework that learns batch-robust cell painting representations by aligning embeddings of cells with the same perturbation across different wells, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly less data and smaller model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate drug discovery by developing computational models that can predict cellular phenotypic responses to perturbations, while overcoming challenges in extracting biologically meaningful and batch-robust cell painting representations that conventional self-supervised and contrastive learning methods struggle with.

Method: Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN) - a representation learning framework that enforces semantic consistency by aligning embeddings of cells subjected to the same perturbation across different wells, integrated into a masked siamese architecture for data and parameter efficiency.

Result: CWA-MSN outperforms state-of-the-art methods (OpenPhenom and CellCLIP) by +29% and +9% respectively in gene-gene relationship retrieval, while using substantially fewer data (0.2M vs 2.2M images) and smaller model size (22M vs 1.48B parameters).

Conclusion: CWA-MSN provides a simple and effective way to learn cell image representation, enabling efficient phenotype modeling even under limited data and parameter budgets, making it highly suitable for drug discovery applications.

Abstract: Computational models that predict cellular phenotypic responses to chemical
and genetic perturbations can accelerate drug discovery by prioritizing
therapeutic hypotheses and reducing costly wet-lab iteration. However,
extracting biologically meaningful and batch-robust cell painting
representations remains challenging. Conventional self-supervised and
contrastive learning approaches often require a large-scale model and/or a huge
amount of carefully curated data, still struggling with batch effects. We
present Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN), a novel
representation learning framework that aligns embeddings of cells subjected to
the same perturbation across different wells, enforcing semantic consistency
despite batch effects. Integrated into a masked siamese architecture, this
alignment yields features that capture fine-grained morphology while remaining
data- and parameter-efficient. For instance, in a gene-gene relationship
retrieval benchmark, CWA-MSN outperforms the state-of-the-art publicly
available self-supervised (OpenPhenom) and contrastive learning (CellCLIP)
methods, improving the benchmark scores by +29\% and +9\%, respectively, while
training on substantially fewer data (e.g., 0.2M images for CWA-MSN vs. 2.2M
images for OpenPhenom) or smaller model size (e.g., 22M parameters for CWA-MSN
vs. 1.48B parameters for CellCLIP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that
CWA-MSN is a simple and effective way to learn cell image representation,
enabling efficient phenotype modeling even under limited data and parameter

*Jiangxue Yu,Hui Wang,San Jiang,Xing Zhang,Dejin Zhang,Qingquan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A feature matching algorithm for aerial and ground images using intermediate views to bridge perspective distortions caused by viewpoint changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of aerial and ground images is limited by finding reliable correspondences due to extensive viewpoint changes and perspective distortions.

Method: 1) Reconstruct sparse models from aerial images using incremental SfM; 2) Use 3D Gaussian Splatting for scene rendering; 3) Generate intermediate images to bridge aerial-ground gap; 4) Perform feature matching through intermediate views.

Result: The method provides reliable feature matches with significant increase in initial and refined matches, enabling accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based scene rendering.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively addresses the feature matching challenge between aerial and ground images through intermediate view generation, improving 3D modeling of complex scenes.

Abstract: The integration of aerial and ground images has been a promising solution in
3D modeling of complex scenes, which is seriously restricted by finding
reliable correspondences. The primary contribution of this study is a feature
matching algorithm for aerial and ground images, whose core idea is to generate
intermediate views to alleviate perspective distortions caused by the extensive
viewpoint changes. First, by using aerial images only, sparse models are
reconstructed through an incremental SfM (Structure from Motion) engine due to
their large scene coverage. Second, 3D Gaussian Splatting is then adopted for
scene rendering by taking as inputs sparse points and oriented images. For
accurate view rendering, a render viewpoint determination algorithm is designed
by using the oriented camera poses of aerial images, which is used to generate
high-quality intermediate images that can bridge the gap between aerial and
ground images. Third, with the aid of intermediate images, reliable feature
matching is conducted for match pairs from render-aerial and render-ground
images, and final matches can be generated by transmitting correspondences
through intermediate views. By using real aerial and ground datasets, the
validation of the proposed solution has been verified in terms of feature
matching and scene rendering and compared comprehensively with widely used
methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can
provide reliable feature matches for aerial and ground images with an obvious
increase in the number of initial and refined matches, and it can provide
enough matches to achieve accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based
scene rendering.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS-RoadPatching is a 3D Gaussian Splatting-based inpainting method for driving scenes that performs substitutional completion by matching similar structural patterns from reconstructed regions, avoiding the need for 2D diffusion models or retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS inpainting methods rely on 2D perspective-view-based diffusion or GAN models, which require spatial-temporal consistency and time-intensive retraining. The authors aim to enable direct 3DGS-based inpainting by leveraging the repetitive patterns in driving scenes.

Method: The method constructs feature-embedded 3DGS scenes with patch measurement for abstracting local context, proposes structural search to find candidate patches in 3D space, and uses substitution-and-fusion optimization for visual harmony.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and interoperability for driving scenes, with additional validation in general scenes demonstrating broader applicability.

Conclusion: GS-RoadPatching provides an effective and efficient 3DGS-based inpainting solution that eliminates dependency on 2D cross-modals and retraining, achieving superior performance through structural matching and substitutional completion.

Abstract: This paper presents GS-RoadPatching, an inpainting method for driving scene
completion by referring to completely reconstructed regions, which are
represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike existing 3DGS inpainting
methods that perform generative completion relying on 2D perspective-view-based
diffusion or GAN models to predict limited appearance or depth cues for missing
regions, our approach enables substitutional scene inpainting and editing
directly through the 3DGS modality, extricating it from requiring
spatial-temporal consistency of 2D cross-modals and eliminating the need for
time-intensive retraining of Gaussians. Our key insight is that the highly
repetitive patterns in driving scenes often share multi-modal similarities
within the implicit 3DGS feature space and are particularly suitable for
structural matching to enable effective 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting.
Practically, we construct feature-embedded 3DGS scenes to incorporate a patch
measurement method for abstracting local context at different scales and,
subsequently, propose a structural search method to find candidate patches in
3D space effectively. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective
substitution-and-fusion optimization for better visual harmony. We conduct
extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets to demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in driving scenes, and
the results validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the baseline methods in terms of both quality and interoperability.
Additional experiments in general scenes also demonstrate the applicability of
the proposed 3D inpainting strategy. The project page and code are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel technique for interpreting CLIP-ResNet neurons by decomposing their contributions through neuron-head pairs, which can be approximated by single directions in the embedding space and used for semantic segmentation and dataset monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and interpret the internal representations of CLIP-ResNet by analyzing individual computation paths rather than treating neurons as monolithic units.

Method: Analyze pairwise combinations of neurons and attention heads in CLIP's attention-pooling layer, approximating neuron-head pairs as single directions in the image-text embedding space and associating them with text interpretations.

Result: Discovered that only a sparse set of neuron-head pairs significantly contribute to outputs, some represent sub-concepts of neurons, and these pairs outperform previous methods for CLIP-ResNet semantic segmentation while effectively monitoring dataset distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Examining individual computation paths reveals interpretable units in neural networks that can be practically applied to downstream tasks like semantic segmentation and dataset monitoring.

Abstract: We present a novel technique for interpreting the neurons in CLIP-ResNet by
decomposing their contributions to the output into individual computation
paths. More specifically, we analyze all pairwise combinations of neurons and
the following attention heads of CLIP's attention-pooling layer. We find that
these neuron-head pairs can be approximated by a single direction in
CLIP-ResNet's image-text embedding space. Leveraging this insight, we interpret
each neuron-head pair by associating it with text. Additionally, we find that
only a sparse set of the neuron-head pairs have a significant contribution to
the output value, and that some neuron-head pairs, while polysemantic,
represent sub-concepts of their corresponding neurons. We use these
observations for two applications. First, we employ the pairs for training-free
semantic segmentation, outperforming previous methods for CLIP-ResNet. Second,
we utilize the contributions of neuron-head pairs to monitor dataset
distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that examining individual
computation paths in neural networks uncovers interpretable units, and that
such units can be utilized for downstream tasks.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation of Video Language Models using metrics like METEOR, perplexity, and Coleman-Liau readability score. Introduced new complaint retention (CR) metric to distinguish CoD-V from standard video description tasks.

Conclusion: The study establishes a foundation for enabling users to express complaints through video, providing a new research direction in complaint mining with practical applications for customer service platforms.

Abstract: While there exists a lot of work on explainable complaint mining,
articulating user concerns through text or video remains a significant
challenge, often leaving issues unresolved. Users frequently struggle to
express their complaints clearly in text but can easily upload videos depicting
product defects (e.g., vague text such as `worst product' paired with a
5-second video depicting a broken headphone with the right earcup). This paper
formulates a new task in the field of complaint mining to aid the common users'
need to write an expressive complaint, which is Complaint Description from
Videos (CoD-V) (e.g., to help the above user articulate her complaint about the
defective right earcup). To this end, we introduce ComVID, a video complaint
dataset containing 1,175 complaint videos and the corresponding descriptions,
also annotated with the emotional state of the complainer. Additionally, we
present a new complaint retention (CR) evaluation metric that discriminates the
proposed (CoD-V) task against standard video summary generation and description
tasks. To strengthen this initiative, we introduce a multimodal
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) embedded VideoLLaMA2-7b model, designed to
generate complaints while accounting for the user's emotional state. We conduct
a comprehensive evaluation of several Video Language Models on several tasks
(pre-trained and fine-tuned versions) with a range of established evaluation
metrics, including METEOR, perplexity, and the Coleman-Liau readability score,
among others. Our study lays the foundation for a new research direction to
provide a platform for users to express complaints through video. Dataset and

### [43] [SynchroRaMa : Lip-Synchronized and Emotion-Aware Talking Face Generation via Multi-Modal Emotion Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19965)
*Phyo Thet Yee,Dimitrios Kollias,Sudeepta Mishra,Abhinav Dhall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynchroRaMa is a novel framework for audio-driven talking face generation that integrates multi-modal emotion embedding from text and audio, uses audio-to-motion for natural head movement, and incorporates LLM-generated scene descriptions for dynamic actions and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing emotion-aware talking face generation methods rely on single modality emotion embedding (either audio or image only) and condition on single reference images, limiting their ability to capture nuanced affective cues and represent dynamic changes in actions/attributes over time.

Method: SynchroRaMa combines emotional signals from text (sentiment analysis) and audio (speech emotion recognition + valence-arousal features), includes an audio-to-motion module for lip synchronization and head motion, and incorporates LLM-generated scene descriptions as additional textual input for dynamic action capture.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experiments show SynchroRaMa outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image quality, expression preservation, and motion realism. User study confirms higher subjective ratings in overall naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness.

Conclusion: The multi-modal emotion embedding approach with text and audio integration, combined with dynamic scene conditioning, enables richer emotional expressiveness and better temporal consistency in talking face generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has received growing interest,
particularly for applications requiring expressive and natural human-avatar
interaction. However, most existing emotion-aware methods rely on a single
modality (either audio or image) for emotion embedding, limiting their ability
to capture nuanced affective cues. Additionally, most methods condition on a
single reference image, restricting the model's ability to represent dynamic
changes in actions or attributes across time. To address these issues, we
introduce SynchroRaMa, a novel framework that integrates a multi-modal emotion
embedding by combining emotional signals from text (via sentiment analysis) and
audio (via speech-based emotion recognition and audio-derived valence-arousal
features), enabling the generation of talking face videos with richer and more
authentic emotional expressiveness and fidelity. To ensure natural head motion
and accurate lip synchronization, SynchroRaMa includes an audio-to-motion (A2M)
module that generates motion frames aligned with the input audio. Finally,
SynchroRaMa incorporates scene descriptions generated by Large Language Model
(LLM) as additional textual input, enabling it to capture dynamic actions and
high-level semantic attributes. Conditioning the model on both visual and
textual cues enhances temporal consistency and visual realism. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SynchroRaMa
outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements in image quality,
expression preservation, and motion realism. A user study further confirms that
SynchroRaMa achieves higher subjective ratings than competing methods in
overall naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness. Our project page

### [44] [OmniScene: Attention-Augmented Multimodal 4D Scene Understanding for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19973)
*Pei Liu,Hongliang Lu,Haichao Liu,Haipeng Liu,Xin Liu,Ruoyu Yao,Shengbo Eben Li,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniScene is a novel human-like framework for autonomous driving that integrates multi-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding, using vision-language models and hierarchical fusion to achieve superior performance across perception, prediction, planning, and VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems lack true 3D scene understanding capabilities similar to human vision, relying instead on depth-based 3D reconstruction. The goal is to develop a more human-like perception-understanding-action architecture.

Method: Proposes OmniScene with OmniVLM (vision-language model) for 4D scene understanding, teacher-student architecture with knowledge distillation to embed textual representations into 3D features, and Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) for adaptive calibration of geometric and semantic features across multiple abstraction levels.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation on nuScenes dataset shows superior performance against over ten state-of-the-art models, establishing new benchmarks in perception, prediction, planning, and visual question answering tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed human-like framework successfully bridges the gap between 2D observations and egocentric 3D scene understanding, enabling more adaptive behaviors in autonomous driving systems through synergistic integration of visual and textual modalities.

Abstract: Human vision is capable of transforming two-dimensional observations into an
egocentric three-dimensional scene understanding, which underpins the ability
to translate complex scenes and exhibit adaptive behaviors. This capability,
however, remains lacking in current autonomous driving systems, where
mainstream approaches primarily rely on depth-based 3D reconstruction rather
than true scene understanding. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
human-like framework called OmniScene. First, we introduce the OmniScene
Vision-Language Model (OmniVLM), a vision-language framework that integrates
multi-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. Then,
harnessing a teacher-student OmniVLM architecture and knowledge distillation,
we embed textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic
supervision, enriching feature learning, and explicitly capturing human-like
attentional semantics. These feature representations are further aligned with
human driving behaviors, forming a more human-like
perception-understanding-action architecture. In addition, we propose a
Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to address imbalances in modality
contributions during multimodal integration. Our approach adaptively calibrates
the relative significance of geometric and semantic features at multiple
abstraction levels, enabling the synergistic use of complementary cues from
visual and textual modalities. This learnable dynamic fusion enables a more
nuanced and effective exploitation of heterogeneous information. We evaluate
OmniScene comprehensively on the nuScenes dataset, benchmarking it against over
ten state-of-the-art models across various tasks. Our approach consistently
achieves superior results, establishing new benchmarks in perception,
prediction, planning, and visual question answering.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CamPVG is the first diffusion-based framework for panoramic video generation guided by precise camera poses, overcoming challenges in panoramic pose representation and spherical projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on camera control in perspective projection video generation, but geometrically consistent panoramic video generation remains challenging due to complexities in panoramic pose representation and spherical projection.

Method: Proposes panoramic Plücker embedding for camera position encoding and spherical epipolar module for cross-view feature aggregation using adaptive attention masking along epipolar lines based on spherical projection.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the method generates high-quality panoramic videos consistent with camera trajectories, far surpassing existing methods in panoramic video generation.

Conclusion: CamPVG effectively addresses the limitations of traditional methods in panoramic video generation by introducing novel pose encoding and feature aggregation techniques that capture panoramic geometry and enforce geometric constraints.

Abstract: Recently, camera-controlled video generation has seen rapid development,
offering more precise control over video generation. However, existing methods
predominantly focus on camera control in perspective projection video
generation, while geometrically consistent panoramic video generation remains
challenging. This limitation is primarily due to the inherent complexities in
panoramic pose representation and spherical projection. To address this issue,
we propose CamPVG, the first diffusion-based framework for panoramic video
generation guided by precise camera poses. We achieve camera position encoding
for panoramic images and cross-view feature aggregation based on spherical
projection. Specifically, we propose a panoramic Pl\"ucker embedding that
encodes camera extrinsic parameters through spherical coordinate
transformation. This pose encoder effectively captures panoramic geometry,
overcoming the limitations of traditional methods when applied to
equirectangular projections. Additionally, we introduce a spherical epipolar
module that enforces geometric constraints through adaptive attention masking
along epipolar lines. This module enables fine-grained cross-view feature
aggregation, substantially enhancing the quality and consistency of generated
panoramic videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates
high-quality panoramic videos consistent with camera trajectories, far
surpassing existing methods in panoramic video generation.

Motivation: Pomelo detection is crucial for localization, automated harvesting, and maturity analysis, but detecting Shatian pomelo in complex orchard environments faces challenges including multi-scale issues, obstructions from trunks and leaves, and small object detection.

Method: Proposes SDE-DET model with three key components: Star Block for high-dimensional information acquisition, Deformable Attention in backbone for occlusion handling, and multiple Efficient Multi-Scale Attention mechanisms for computational efficiency and small object detection.

Conclusion: SDE-DET provides a reliable method for Shatian pomelo detection and lays the foundation for developing automatic harvest robots, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in complex orchard environments.

Abstract: Pomelo detection is an essential process for their localization, automated
robotic harvesting, and maturity analysis. However, detecting Shatian pomelo in
complex orchard environments poses significant challenges, including
multi-scale issues, obstructions from trunks and leaves, small object
detection, etc. To address these issues, this study constructs a custom dataset
STP-AgriData and proposes the SDE-DET model for Shatian pomelo detection.
SDE-DET first utilizes the Star Block to effectively acquire high-dimensional
information without increasing the computational overhead. Furthermore, the
presented model adopts Deformable Attention in its backbone, to enhance its
ability to detect pomelos under occluded conditions. Finally, multiple
Efficient Multi-Scale Attention mechanisms are integrated into our model to
reduce the computational overhead and extract deep visual representations,
thereby improving the capacity for small object detection. In the experiment,
we compared SDE-DET with the Yolo series and other mainstream detection models
in Shatian pomelo detection. The presented SDE-DET model achieved scores of
0.883, 0.771, 0.838, 0.497, and 0.823 in Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5,
mAP@0.5:0.95 and F1-score, respectively. SDE-DET has achieved state-of-the-art
performance on the STP-AgriData dataset. Experiments indicate that the SDE-DET
provides a reliable method for Shatian pomelo detection, laying the foundation
for the further development of automatic harvest robots.

### [47] [Improving Generalizability and Undetectability for Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Multimodal Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19994)
*Zhifang Zhang,Jiahan Zhang,Shengjie Zhou,Qi Wei,Shuo He,Feng Liu,Lei Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA), a novel method to improve targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained models by addressing limitations in generalizability and undetectability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained models have limitations in generalizability (limited transfer to partially known or semantically similar targets) and undetectability (easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods).

Method: PTA leverages multiple source-modal and target-modal proxies to optimize targeted adversarial examples, ensuring they remain evasive to defenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. The method includes theoretical analyses to optimize generalizability while meeting undetectability requirements.

Result: Experimental results show that PTA achieves high success rates across various related targets and remains undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.

Conclusion: PTA effectively addresses the limitations of existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained models by improving both generalizability and undetectability through proxy-based optimization and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Multimodal pre-trained models (e.g., ImageBind), which align distinct data
modalities into a shared embedding space, have shown remarkable success across
downstream tasks. However, their increasing adoption raises serious security
concerns, especially regarding targeted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we
show that existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained
models still have limitations in two aspects: generalizability and
undetectability. Specifically, the crafted targeted adversarial examples (AEs)
exhibit limited generalization to partially known or semantically similar
targets in cross-modal alignment tasks (i.e., limited generalizability) and can
be easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods (i.e., limited
undetectability). To address these limitations, we propose a novel method
called Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA), which leverages multiple source-modal and
target-modal proxies to optimize targeted AEs, ensuring they remain evasive to
defenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. We also provide
theoretical analyses to highlight the relationship between generalizability and
undetectability and to ensure optimal generalizability while meeting the
specified requirements for undetectability. Furthermore, experimental results
demonstrate that our PTA can achieve a high success rate across various related
targets and remain undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.

### [48] [Anomaly Detection by Clustering DINO Embeddings using a Dirichlet Process Mixture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19997)
*Nico Schulthess,Ender Konukoglu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using DINOv2 embeddings with Dirichlet Process Mixture Model for unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging, achieving competitive performance while reducing computational burden.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory-bank approaches for anomaly detection become computationally expensive for large medical datasets, requiring a more efficient method.

Method: Model DINOv2 embeddings with Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM) to automatically determine mixture components, using similarity between component centers and embeddings as anomaly score function.

Result: Achieves competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks while halving computation time at inference; normalized DINOv2 embeddings show better alignment with anatomical structures.

Conclusion: DPMM modeling of DINOv2 embeddings provides efficient and effective unsupervised anomaly detection for medical imaging, even when using features trained on natural images.

Abstract: In this work, we leverage informative embeddings from foundational models for
unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging. For small datasets, a
memory-bank of normative features can directly be used for anomaly detection
which has been demonstrated recently. However, this is unsuitable for large
medical datasets as the computational burden increases substantially.
Therefore, we propose to model the distribution of normative DINOv2 embeddings
with a Dirichlet Process Mixture model (DPMM), a non-parametric mixture model
that automatically adjusts the number of mixture components to the data at
hand. Rather than using a memory bank, we use the similarity between the
component centers and the embeddings as anomaly score function to create a
coarse anomaly segmentation mask. Our experiments show that through DPMM
embeddings of DINOv2, despite being trained on natural images, achieve very
competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks and can
do this while at least halving the computation time at inference. Our analysis
further indicates that normalized DINOv2 embeddings are generally more aligned
with anatomical structures than unnormalized features, even in the presence of
anomalies, making them great representations for anomaly detection. The code is

Motivation: Efficient data annotation is critical for machine learning, especially in object detection tasks that require extensive labeled data. Active learning can minimize annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples.

Method: Combines uncertainty-based and diversity-based selection strategies to ensure representative examples that improve model generalization. Evaluated on TableBank-LaTeX and TableBank-Word datasets using CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9 architectures.

Result: AL-based example selection significantly outperforms random sampling, reducing annotation effort while maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.

Conclusion: The proposed active learning method effectively reduces annotation costs for object detection tasks while maintaining high performance, making it a practical solution for data-efficient machine learning.

Abstract: Efficient data annotation remains a critical challenge in machine learning,
particularly for object detection tasks requiring extensive labeled data.
Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to minimize annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples. While traditional AL
approaches primarily rely on uncertainty-based selection, recent advances
suggest that incorporating diversity-based strategies can enhance sampling
efficiency in object detection tasks. Our approach ensures the selection of
representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our
method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using
state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our
results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms
random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while
maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Our method
achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.

*Xuekang Zhu,Ji-Zhe Zhou,Kaiwen Feng,Chenfan Qu,Yunfei Wang,Liting Zhou,Jian liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RITA reformulates image manipulation localization as conditional sequence prediction, addressing the limitations of one-shot methods by modeling temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures in editing operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image manipulation localization methods are process-agnostic and use one-shot prediction, which causes dimensional collapse and fails to capture the sequential and hierarchical nature of manipulation processes.

Method: Proposes RITA framework that predicts manipulated regions layer-by-layer in ordered manner, using each step's prediction as condition for next step. Constructs HSIM benchmark with multi-step manipulation data and introduces HSS metric for evaluation.

Result: RITA achieves state-of-the-art performance on traditional benchmarks and provides solid foundation for hierarchical localization task, validating its effectiveness as a general paradigm.

Conclusion: The sequential prediction approach better matches the intrinsic nature of image manipulation localization tasks and shows promising potential for future research.

Abstract: Image manipulations often entail a complex manipulation process, comprising a
series of editing operations to create a deceptive image, exhibiting
sequentiality and hierarchical characteristics. However, existing IML methods
remain manipulation-process-agnostic, directly producing localization masks in
a one-shot prediction paradigm without modeling the underlying editing steps.
This one-shot paradigm compresses the high-dimensional compositional space into
a single binary mask, inducing severe dimensional collapse, thereby creating a
fundamental mismatch with the intrinsic nature of the IML task.
  To address this, we are the first to reformulate image manipulation
localization as a conditional sequence prediction task, proposing the RITA
framework. RITA predicts manipulated regions layer-by-layer in an ordered
manner, using each step's prediction as the condition for the next, thereby
explicitly modeling temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures among
editing operations.
  To enable training and evaluation, we synthesize multi-step manipulation data
and construct a new benchmark HSIM. We further propose the HSS metric to assess
sequential order and hierarchical alignment. Extensive experiments show RITA
achieves SOTA on traditional benchmarks and provides a solid foundation for the
novel hierarchical localization task, validating its potential as a general and
effective paradigm. The code and dataset will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PS3 is a multimodal fusion model that integrates pathology reports, whole slide images, and transcriptomic data for improved cancer survival prediction using prototype-based representations to handle modality imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal approaches focus on histology-genomic integration, but pathology reports provide valuable complementary information. However, fusing these heterogeneous modalities (high-dimensional WSIs vs. concise text reports) poses challenges due to modality imbalance.

Method: Proposes PS3: a prototype-based approach with (1) diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports using self-attention, (2) histological prototypes for WSIs, and (3) biological pathway prototypes for transcriptomics. Uses Transformer-based fusion to model intra-modal and cross-modal interactions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on six TCGA datasets against clinical, unimodal, and multimodal baselines.

Conclusion: Incorporating pathology reports with WSIs and transcriptomic data through prototype-based balanced representations significantly enhances survival prediction performance in computational oncology.

Abstract: Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily
focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with
genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We
hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic
performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows,
offer readily available complementary information by summarizing
histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical
context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their
heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several
billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of
varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we
propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which
are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival
prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities).
Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports,
leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and
standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly
represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway
prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular
functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting
prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal
interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The
proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against
clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA). The code is available at: https://github.com/manahilr/PS3.

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving authentication method using GANs to transform face images into visually private domains (e.g., flowers or shoes) for secure biometric authentication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current biometric authentication systems lack user control over data usage and are vulnerable to data leaks and misuse without user knowledge.

Method: Uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to translate face images into visually private domains, then trains classifiers on these transformed images for authentication purposes.

Result: The method demonstrates robustness against attacks while maintaining meaningful utility based on experimental evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed GAN-based approach provides a privacy-preserving authentication solution that protects user biometric data while maintaining system functionality.

Abstract: Biometric-based authentication systems are getting broadly adopted in many
areas. However, these systems do not allow participating users to influence the
way their data is used. Furthermore, the data may leak and can be misused
without the users' knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new authentication
method that preserves the privacy of individuals and is based on a generative
adversarial network (GAN). Concretely, we suggest using the GAN for translating
images of faces to a visually private domain (e.g., flowers or shoes).
Classifiers, which are used for authentication purposes, are then trained on
the images from the visually private domain. Based on our experiments, the
method is robust against attacks and still provides meaningful utility.

TL;DR: A framework to predict video frame quality for secure graphic verification, addressing reliability issues from poor smartphone captures by using a lightweight model to select frames for resource-intensive verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor image acquisition on smartphones undermines secure graphic verification reliability, causing high false rejection rates due to uncontrolled user captures of high-entropy patterns.

Method: Proposes a lightweight model to predict quality scores for video frames, determining suitability for verification. Uses frozen ImageNet-pretrained network with lightweight probe instead of full fine-tuning. Validated on 32,000+ images from 105 smartphones with FNMR and ISRR metrics.

Result: Framework effectively bridges reliability gap. Key finding: frozen general-purpose backbone with lightweight probe generalizes better to unseen printing technologies than fully fine-tuned models, preventing overfitting to source-domain artifacts.

Conclusion: For domain shifts from physical manufacturing, frozen general-purpose backbones are more robust than full fine-tuning, providing key insight for real-world generalization in secure graphic verification systems.

Abstract: The reliability of secure graphic verification, a key anti-counterfeiting
tool, is undermined by poor image acquisition on smartphones. Uncontrolled user
captures of these high-entropy patterns cause high false rejection rates,
creating a significant 'reliability gap'. To bridge this gap, we depart from
traditional perceptual IQA and introduce a framework that predictively
estimates a frame's utility for the downstream verification task. We propose a
lightweight model to predict a quality score for a video frame, determining its
suitability for a resource-intensive oracle model. Our framework is validated
using re-contextualized FNMR and ISRR metrics on a large-scale dataset of
32,000+ images from 105 smartphones. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain analysis
on graphics from different industrial printing presses reveals a key finding: a
lightweight probe on a frozen, ImageNet-pretrained network generalizes better
to an unseen printing technology than a fully fine-tuned model. This provides a
key insight for real-world generalization: for domain shifts from physical
manufacturing, a frozen general-purpose backbone can be more robust than full
fine-tuning, which can overfit to source-domain artifacts.

TL;DR: SHMoAReg is a novel expert-guided Deformable Image Registration network that uses Mixture of Experts mechanism in both encoder and decoder, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current encoder-decoder architectures for Deformable Image Registration lack specialized feature extraction and predict deformation fields homogeneously in all three directions, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes SHMoAReg with Mixture of Attention heads (MoA) in encoder layers for specialized feature extraction and Spatial Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (SHMoE) in decoder layers for heterogeneous deformation field prediction using experts with varying kernel sizes.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public datasets show consistent improvements, with Dice score increasing from 60.58% to 65.58% on abdominal CT dataset. The method also enhances model interpretability by differentiating experts' utilities across resolution layers.

Conclusion: SHMoAReg is the first to introduce Mixture of Experts mechanism into DIR tasks, achieving superior performance and interpretability compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Encoder-Decoder architectures are widely used in deep learning-based
Deformable Image Registration (DIR), where the encoder extracts multi-scale
features and the decoder predicts deformation fields by recovering spatial
locations. However, current methods lack specialized extraction of features
(that are useful for registration) and predict deformation jointly and
homogeneously in all three directions. In this paper, we propose a novel
expert-guided DIR network with Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism applied in
both encoder and decoder, named SHMoAReg. Specifically, we incorporate Mixture
of Attention heads (MoA) into encoder layers, while Spatial Heterogeneous
Mixture of Experts (SHMoE) into the decoder layers. The MoA enhances the
specialization of feature extraction by dynamically selecting the optimal
combination of attention heads for each image token. Meanwhile, the SHMoE
predicts deformation fields heterogeneously in three directions for each voxel
using experts with varying kernel sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on two
publicly available datasets show consistent improvements over various methods,
with a notable increase from 60.58% to 65.58% in Dice score for the abdominal
CT dataset. Furthermore, SHMoAReg enhances model interpretability by
differentiating experts' utilities across/within different resolution layers.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce MoE mechanism into
DIR tasks. The code will be released soon.

TL;DR: DiffLI²D is a novel image dehazing method that leverages pre-trained diffusion models' latent representations without retraining, achieving superior performance with reduced computational burden.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational limitations of diffusion models in image dehazing (retraining costs and extensive sampling steps) by exploring hazy image properties in frozen pre-trained diffusion models' semantic latent space.

Method: Uses diffusion latent representations at different time-steps from pre-trained models to guide a dehazing network, avoiding retraining and iterative sampling while effectively utilizing informative representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to existing image dehazing methods.

Conclusion: The method provides a novel perspective for introducing diffusion models to image dehazing by effectively utilizing pre-trained models' latent representations, achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been investigated as powerful generative
solvers for image dehazing, owing to their remarkable capability to model the
data distribution. However, the massive computational burden imposed by the
retraining of diffusion models, coupled with the extensive sampling steps
during the inference, limit the broader application of diffusion models in
image dehazing. To address these issues, we explore the properties of hazy
images in the semantic latent space of frozen pre-trained diffusion models, and
propose a Diffusion Latent Inspired network for Image Dehazing, dubbed
DiffLI$^2$D. Specifically, we first reveal that the semantic latent space of
pre-trained diffusion models can represent the content and haze characteristics
of hazy images, as the diffusion time-step changes. Building upon this insight,
we integrate the diffusion latent representations at different time-steps into
a delicately designed dehazing network to provide instructions for image
dehazing. Our DiffLI$^2$D avoids re-training diffusion models and iterative
sampling process by effectively utilizing the informative representations
derived from the pre-trained diffusion models, which also offers a novel
perspective for introducing diffusion models to image dehazing. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior performance to existing image dehazing methods. Code is available at

*JuanaJuana Valeria Hurtado,Rohit Mohan,Abhinav Valada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision foundation models to achieve state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance on hyperspectral imaging data for autonomous driving applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HSI semantic segmentation methods underperform because they rely on architectures optimized for RGB inputs. Hyperspectral imaging's rich spectral content has potential for robust robotic perception in challenging environments.

Method: Proposes a hyperspectral adapter with spectral transformer and spectrum-aware spatial prior module to extract spatial-spectral features. Uses modality-aware interaction block to integrate hyperspectral representations with frozen vision Transformer features through extraction and injection mechanisms.

Result: Extensive evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral segmentation methods.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively leverages pretrained vision foundation models to learn from hyperspectral data, achieving superior performance for semantic segmentation tasks in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures spatial information along with dense
spectral measurements across numerous narrow wavelength bands. This rich
spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception,
particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying
illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI
semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on
architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work,
we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision
foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our
architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial
prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we
introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective
integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer
features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive
evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our
architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while
directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral
segmentation methods. We make the code available at

*Belal Shoer,Yova Kementchedjhieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in scientific visual question answering by converting separate image-text pairs into unified 'text-in-image' format for fine-tuning multimodal models, achieving significant improvements across 13 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific visual question answering is difficult for vision-language models due to complex figures and multimodal context. Existing approaches treat visual and textual content separately, and even state-of-the-art models perform poorly in zero-shot settings on the EXAMS-V benchmark that uses embedded text-in-image format.

Method: To overcome data scarcity in text-in-image format, the authors synthesize a new dataset by converting existing separate image-text pairs into unified images. They then fine-tune a small multilingual multimodal model on a combination of their synthetic data and the EXAMS-V dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning on the mixed dataset yields notable gains across 13 languages, demonstrating strong average improvements and effective cross-lingual transfer capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach of synthesizing text-in-image training data and fine-tuning multimodal models effectively addresses the challenges of scientific visual question answering, showing significant performance improvements across multiple languages.

Abstract: Scientific visual question answering poses significant challenges for
vision-language models due to the complexity of scientific figures and their
multimodal context. Traditional approaches treat the figure and accompanying
text (e.g., questions and answer options) as separate inputs. EXAMS-V
introduced a new paradigm by embedding both visual and textual content into a
single image. However, even state-of-the-art proprietary models perform poorly
on this setup in zero-shot settings, underscoring the need for task-specific
fine-tuning. To address the scarcity of training data in this "text-in-image"
format, we synthesize a new dataset by converting existing separate image-text
pairs into unified images. Fine-tuning a small multilingual multimodal model on
a mix of our synthetic data and EXAMS-V yields notable gains across 13
languages, demonstrating strong average improvements and cross-lingual
transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoBench is introduced to evaluate sycophancy (uncritical echoing of user-provided information) in medical LVLMs, revealing high sycophancy rates across models despite moderate accuracy, with mitigation strategies proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical LVLM benchmarks focus on accuracy but overlook reliability and safety, particularly sycophancy in high-stakes clinical settings.

Method: EchoBench contains 2,122 images across 18 departments and 20 modalities with 90 prompts simulating biased inputs. Evaluates medical-specific, open-source, and proprietary LVLMs with fine-grained analyses by bias type, department, etc.

Result: All models show substantial sycophancy (45.98% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet, 59.15% for GPT-4.1, many medical-specific models >95%). Higher data quality/diversity and domain knowledge reduce sycophancy without harming unbiased accuracy.

Conclusion: Robust evaluation beyond accuracy is needed. Prompt-level interventions effectively reduce sycophancy, providing actionable guidance for safer medical LVLMs.

Abstract: Recent benchmarks for medical Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) emphasize
leaderboard accuracy, overlooking reliability and safety. We study sycophancy
-- models' tendency to uncritically echo user-provided information -- in
high-stakes clinical settings. We introduce EchoBench, a benchmark to
systematically evaluate sycophancy in medical LVLMs. It contains 2,122 images
across 18 departments and 20 modalities with 90 prompts that simulate biased
inputs from patients, medical students, and physicians. We evaluate
medical-specific, open-source, and proprietary LVLMs. All exhibit substantial
sycophancy; the best proprietary model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) still shows 45.98%
sycophancy, and GPT-4.1 reaches 59.15%. Many medical-specific models exceed 95%
sycophancy despite only moderate accuracy. Fine-grained analyses by bias type,
department, perceptual granularity, and modality identify factors that increase
susceptibility. We further show that higher data quality/diversity and stronger
domain knowledge reduce sycophancy without harming unbiased accuracy. EchoBench
also serves as a testbed for mitigation: simple prompt-level interventions
(negative prompting, one-shot, few-shot) produce consistent reductions and
motivate training- and decoding-time strategies. Our findings highlight the
need for robust evaluation beyond accuracy and provide actionable guidance
toward safer, more trustworthy medical LVLMs.

*Sanish Suwal,Shaurya Garg,Dipkamal Bhusal,Michael Clifford,Nidhi Rastogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pruning significantly improves the quality and faithfulness of post-hoc explanations (saliency maps) for traffic sign classifiers compared to natural and adversarial training approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Connected and autonomous vehicles rely on AI systems where transparency and security are critical, but post-hoc explanations often suffer from inconsistencies and lack of faithfulness in representing model decisions.

Method: Systematically examined the impact of three training approaches (natural training, adversarial training, and pruning) on post-hoc explanation quality for traffic sign classifiers through extensive empirical evaluation.

Result: Pruning significantly enhances the comprehensibility and faithfulness of explanations by enforcing sparsity in learned representation, leading to more interpretable and reliable decisions.

Conclusion: Pruning is a promising strategy for developing transparent deep learning models, especially in resource-constrained vehicular AI systems, as it improves both model efficiency and explanation quality.

Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles continue to heavily rely on AI systems,
where transparency and security are critical for trust and operational safety.
Post-hoc explanations provide transparency to these black-box like AI models
but the quality and reliability of these explanations is often questioned due
to inconsistencies and lack of faithfulness in representing model decisions.
This paper systematically examines the impact of three widely used training
approaches, namely natural training, adversarial training, and pruning, affect
the quality of post-hoc explanations for traffic sign classifiers. Through
extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that pruning significantly
enhances the comprehensibility and faithfulness of explanations (using saliency
maps). Our findings reveal that pruning not only improves model efficiency but
also enforces sparsity in learned representation, leading to more interpretable
and reliable decisions. Additionally, these insights suggest that pruning is a
promising strategy for developing transparent deep learning models, especially
in resource-constrained vehicular AI systems.

*Min Cen,Zhenfeng Zhuang,Yuzhe Zhang,Min Zeng,Baptiste Magnier,Lequan Yu,Hong Zhang,Liansheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C²MIL is a dual causal graph-based MIL model that addresses semantic bias and topological noise in survival analysis with WSIs through semantic causal intervention and topological causal discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variations in staining and scanning introduce semantic bias, while irrelevant topological subgraphs create noise, leading to biased slide-level representations that hinder interpretability and generalization.

Method: Proposes a dual structural causal model with cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling for semantic causal intervention and Bernoulli differentiable causal subgraph sampling for topological causal discovery, using joint optimization with disentangling supervision and contrastive learning.

Result: C²MIL consistently improves generalization and interpretability over existing methods and can serve as a causal enhancement for diverse MIL baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed dual causal approach effectively addresses semantic and topological biases in graph-based MIL for survival analysis, enhancing both performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Graph-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is widely used in survival
analysis with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs)
due to its ability to capture topological information. However, variations in
staining and scanning can introduce semantic bias, while topological subgraphs
that are not relevant to the causal relationships can create noise, resulting
in biased slide-level representations. These issues can hinder both the
interpretability and generalization of the analysis. To tackle this, we
introduce a dual structural causal model as the theoretical foundation and
propose a novel and interpretable dual causal graph-based MIL model, C$^2$MIL.
C$^2$MIL incorporates a novel cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module
for semantic causal intervention and a new Bernoulli differentiable causal
subgraph sampling method for topological causal discovery. A joint optimization
strategy combining disentangling supervision and contrastive learning enables
simultaneous refinement of both semantic and topological causalities.
Experiments demonstrate that C$^2$MIL consistently improves generalization and
interpretability over existing methods and can serve as a causal enhancement
for diverse MIL baselines. The code is available at

*Zhi Qin Tan,Xiatian Zhu,Owen Addison,Yunpeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-Mamba2-SSL is a semi-supervised learning framework for automated teeth and pulp segmentation in CBCT images that combines self-supervised pre-training, consistency regularization with perturbations, and pseudo-labeling to effectively utilize unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation of teeth and pulp in CBCT images requires extensive expertise and is time-consuming, creating a critical need for automated algorithms that can leverage unlabeled data to reduce annotation burden.

Method: The framework builds on U-Mamba2 model with a multi-stage training strategy: 1) self-supervised pre-training using disruptive autoencoder, 2) consistency regularization with input and feature perturbations for stable outputs, and 3) pseudo-labeling with reduced loss weighting to minimize error impact.

Result: U-Mamba2-SSL achieved an average score of 0.872 and a DSC of 0.969 on the validation dataset, demonstrating superior performance for teeth and pulp segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed semi-supervised learning framework effectively utilizes unlabeled data and achieves high-performance segmentation, providing an automated solution for clinical applications like treatment planning and diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of teeth and pulp in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography
(CBCT) is vital for clinical applications like treatment planning and
diagnosis. However, this process requires extensive expertise and is
exceptionally time-consuming, highlighting the critical need for automated
algorithms that can effectively utilize unlabeled data. In this paper, we
propose U-Mamba2-SSL, a novel semi-supervised learning framework that builds on
the U-Mamba2 model and employs a multi-stage training strategy. The framework
first pre-trains U-Mamba2 in a self-supervised manner using a disruptive
autoencoder. It then leverages unlabeled data through consistency
regularization, where we introduce input and feature perturbations to ensure
stable model outputs. Finally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is implemented with a
reduced loss weighting to minimize the impact of potential errors. U-Mamba2-SSL
achieved an average score of 0.872 and a DSC of 0.969 on the validation
dataset, demonstrating the superior performance of our approach. The code is

### [62] [Optical Ocean Recipes: Creating Realistic Datasets to Facilitate Underwater Vision Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20171)
*Patricia Schöntag,David Nakath,Judith Fischer,Rüdiger Röttgers,Kevin Köser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Optical Ocean Recipes is a framework for creating realistic underwater datasets with controlled conditions to address the lack of generalizable testing environments for machine vision in underwater settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine vision evaluations in underwater environments lack generalizability due to specific optical water types and imaging conditions, making exhaustive testing impractical across diverse scenarios.

Method: The framework uses calibrated color and scattering additives to create repeatable and controlled testing environments that simulate various water compositions and their impact on image appearance.

Result: The system enables generation of ground-truth data for multiple vision tasks including water parameter estimation, image restoration, segmentation, visual SLAM, and underwater image synthesis.

Conclusion: Optical Ocean Recipes provides a unique framework for analyzing machine vision in realistic yet controlled underwater scenarios, with demonstrated applications and available dataset and evaluation code.

Abstract: The development and evaluation of machine vision in underwater environments
remains challenging, often relying on trial-and-error-based testing tailored to
specific applications. This is partly due to the lack of controlled,
ground-truthed testing environments that account for the optical challenges,
such as color distortion from spectrally variant light attenuation, reduced
contrast and blur from backscatter and volume scattering, and dynamic light
patterns from natural or artificial illumination. Additionally, the appearance
of ocean water in images varies significantly across regions, depths, and
seasons. However, most machine vision evaluations are conducted under specific
optical water types and imaging conditions, therefore often lack
generalizability. Exhaustive testing across diverse open-water scenarios is
technically impractical. To address this, we introduce the \textit{Optical
Ocean Recipes}, a framework for creating realistic datasets under controlled
underwater conditions. Unlike synthetic or open-water data, these recipes,
using calibrated color and scattering additives, enable repeatable and
controlled testing of the impact of water composition on image appearance.
Hence, this provides a unique framework for analyzing machine vision in
realistic, yet controlled underwater scenarios. The controlled environment
enables the creation of ground-truth data for a range of vision tasks,
including water parameter estimation, image restoration, segmentation, visual
SLAM, and underwater image synthesis. We provide a demonstration dataset
generated using the Optical Ocean Recipes and briefly demonstrate the use of
our system for two underwater vision tasks. The dataset and evaluation code
will be made available.

### [63] [Universal Camouflage Attack on Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20196)
*Dehong Kong,Sifan Yu,Siyuan Liang,Jiawei Liang,Jianhou Gan,Aishan Liu,Wenqi Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Universal Camouflage Attack (UCA), the first physical adversarial attack framework targeting Visual Language Models for Automated Driving (VLM-AD) systems, which generates physically realizable camouflage textures that generalize across commands and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks have limitations: physical attacks target only vision modules and don't transfer well to VLM-AD systems, while VLM-AD attacks are mainly digital. There's a need for effective physical attacks against VLM-AD.

Method: UCA operates in feature space using feature divergence loss (FDL) to maximize representational discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. It employs multi-scale learning and adjusted sampling ratios for better adaptability to real-world scale/viewpoint changes.

Result: UCA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods (30% improvement in 3-P metrics), induces incorrect driving commands across various VLM-AD models and scenarios, and shows strong robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: UCA demonstrates high potential for practical deployment as the first effective physical adversarial attack framework for VLM-AD systems, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising
research direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning
capabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains
vulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve
misleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing
attacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily
target vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD
systems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2)
Adversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital
level. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage
Attack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on
optimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate
physically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization
across different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the
observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA
introduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational
discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates
a multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its
adaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world
scenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various
VLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing
state-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore,
UCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic
conditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.

*Mahmoud Khater,Mona Strauss,Philipp von Olshausen,Alexander Reiterer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PU-Gaussian is a novel point cloud upsampling method that uses anisotropic 3D Gaussian distributions to model local geometry, enabling explicit upsampling through direct point sampling followed by refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud upsampling methods sacrifice geometric interpretability or robustness to input sparsity. Sparse and noisy 3D point clouds from sensors need dense, high-fidelity representations for downstream tasks.

Method: Models local neighborhoods using anisotropic 3D Gaussian distributions, performs explicit upsampling by direct point sampling to generate dense coarse point cloud, then refines with a network for uniform distribution and sharp edges.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PU1K and PUGAN datasets, demonstrating superior upsampling quality compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: PU-Gaussian provides an effective solution for point cloud upsampling that maintains geometric interpretability while being robust to input sparsity, with publicly available code and models.

Abstract: Point clouds produced by 3D sensors are often sparse and noisy, posing
challenges for tasks requiring dense and high-fidelity 3D representations.
Prior work has explored both implicit feature-based upsampling and
distance-function learning to address this, but often at the expense of
geometric interpretability or robustness to input sparsity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose PU-Gaussian, a novel upsampling network that models the
local neighborhood around each point using anisotropic 3D Gaussian
distributions. These Gaussians capture the underlying geometric structure,
allowing us to perform upsampling explicitly in the local geometric domain by
direct point sampling. The sampling process generates a dense, but coarse,
point cloud. A subsequent refinement network adjusts the coarse output to
produce a more uniform distribution and sharper edges. We perform extensive
testing on the PU1K and PUGAN datasets, demonstrating that PU-Gaussian achieves
state-of-the-art performance. We make code and model weights publicly available
at https://github.com/mvg-inatech/PU-Gaussian.git.

*Tom Burgert,Oliver Stoll,Paolo Rota,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper challenges the established hypothesis that CNNs are inherently texture-biased by proposing a domain-agnostic framework to quantify feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, revealing that CNNs actually rely more on local shape features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit and challenge the widely accepted hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks are inherently texture-biased by addressing limitations in previous cue-conflict experiments and developing a more rigorous evaluation framework.

Method: Proposed a domain-agnostic framework that systematically suppresses shape, texture, and color cues to quantify feature reliance without forced-choice conflicts. Evaluated both humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing domains.

Result: Found that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. This reliance can be mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures. Domain-specific analysis revealed systematic differences: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models show stronger texture reliance.

Conclusion: The texture-bias hypothesis for CNNs is oversimplified; feature reliance patterns vary systematically across domains and can be effectively modified through architectural and training improvements.

Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently
texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep
learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the
cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we
propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through
systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the
confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks
under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently
texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless,
this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies
or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across
computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance
patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape,
medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a
stronger reliance towards texture. Code is available at

*Kwang-Hyun Uhm,Hyunjun Cho,Sung-Hoo Hong,Seung-Won Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel cross-view texture transfer approach for CT slice interpolation that leverages anisotropic characteristics of 3D CT volumes by transferring high-resolution in-plane texture details to low-resolution through-plane images using multi-reference non-local attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical CT images are often acquired with large slice thicknesses due to storage and time constraints, resulting in anisotropic volumes with poor inter-slice resolution that can hinder disease diagnosis. Existing super-resolution methods don't fully exploit the anisotropic nature of 3D CT data.

Method: Proposes a framework that transfers high-resolution in-plane texture details as reference to enhance low-resolution through-plane images. Uses a multi-reference non-local attention module to extract meaningful features for reconstructing through-plane high-frequency details from multiple in-plane images.

Result: The method performs significantly better than existing competing methods on public CT datasets, including a real-paired benchmark, demonstrating superior CT slice interpolation performance.

Conclusion: The proposed cross-view texture transfer framework effectively utilizes the anisotropic characteristics of 3D CT volumes and verifies the effectiveness of transferring in-plane high-resolution details to improve through-plane resolution.

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used non-invasive imaging
modalities for medical diagnosis. In clinical practice, CT images are usually
acquired with large slice thicknesses due to the high cost of memory storage
and operation time, resulting in an anisotropic CT volume with much lower
inter-slice resolution than in-plane resolution. Since such inconsistent
resolution may lead to difficulties in disease diagnosis, deep learning-based
volumetric super-resolution methods have been developed to improve inter-slice
resolution. Most existing methods conduct single-image super-resolution on the
through-plane or synthesize intermediate slices from adjacent slices; however,
the anisotropic characteristic of 3D CT volume has not been well explored. In
this paper, we propose a novel cross-view texture transfer approach for CT
slice interpolation by fully utilizing the anisotropic nature of 3D CT volume.
Specifically, we design a unique framework that takes high-resolution in-plane
texture details as a reference and transfers them to low-resolution
through-plane images. To this end, we introduce a multi-reference non-local
attention module that extracts meaningful features for reconstructing
through-plane high-frequency details from multiple in-plane images. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method performs significantly
better in CT slice interpolation than existing competing methods on public CT
datasets including a real-paired benchmark, verifying the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. The source code of this work is available at

TL;DR: PhiGenesis is a unified framework for 4D scene generation that bridges video generation with novel view synthesis, producing temporally continuous 4D Gaussian splatting representations from multi-view inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models struggle to synthesize dynamic 4D driving scenes that support both temporal extrapolation and spatial novel view synthesis without per-scene optimization. Bridging generation and novel view synthesis remains a major challenge.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Uses pre-trained video VAE with range-view adapter for feed-forward 4D reconstruction from multi-view images; 2) Geometric-guided video diffusion model using rendered historical scenes as priors to generate future views with Stereo Forcing conditioning strategy to address geometric exposure bias.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in appearance/geometric reconstruction, temporal generation, and novel view synthesis tasks, while delivering competitive performance in downstream evaluations.

Conclusion: PhiGenesis successfully bridges the gap between generation and novel view synthesis, providing a unified framework for 4D scene generation with temporal coherence and geometric consistency.

Abstract: Current generative models struggle to synthesize dynamic 4D driving scenes
that simultaneously support temporal extrapolation and spatial novel view
synthesis (NVS) without per-scene optimization. Bridging generation and novel
view synthesis remains a major challenge. We present PhiGenesis, a unified
framework for 4D scene generation that extends video generation techniques with
geometric and temporal consistency. Given multi-view image sequences and camera
parameters, PhiGenesis produces temporally continuous 4D Gaussian splatting
representations along target 3D trajectories. In its first stage, PhiGenesis
leverages a pre-trained video VAE with a novel range-view adapter to enable
feed-forward 4D reconstruction from multi-view images. This architecture
supports single-frame or video inputs and outputs complete 4D scenes including
geometry, semantics, and motion. In the second stage, PhiGenesis introduces a
geometric-guided video diffusion model, using rendered historical 4D scenes as
priors to generate future views conditioned on trajectories. To address
geometric exposure bias in novel views, we propose Stereo Forcing, a novel
conditioning strategy that integrates geometric uncertainty during denoising.
This method enhances temporal coherence by dynamically adjusting generative
influence based on uncertainty-aware perturbations. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
appearance and geometric reconstruction, temporal generation and novel view
synthesis (NVS) tasks, while simultaneously delivering competitive performance
in downstream evaluations. Homepage is at

TL;DR: VersaMammo is a versatile foundation model for mammograms that addresses limitations in current breast cancer detection models through a two-stage pre-training strategy and comprehensive evaluation across 92 clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models for mammogram analysis have fundamental limitations including insufficient training data diversity, limited generalizability, and lack of comprehensive clinical evaluation, which constrain their clinical translation for breast cancer detection.

Method: Two-stage pre-training strategy: 1) Teacher model trained via self-supervised learning on unlabeled mammograms, 2) Supervised learning with knowledge distillation to transfer features and clinical knowledge. Uses largest multi-institutional dataset (706,239 images from 21 sources) and evaluates across 92 clinical tasks spanning 5 categories.

Result: State-of-the-art performance: ranks first in 50/68 internal tasks and 20/24 external validation tasks, with average ranks of 1.5 and 1.2 respectively, demonstrating superior generalization and clinical utility.

Conclusion: VersaMammo offers substantial advancement toward reliable and scalable breast cancer screening and diagnosis by overcoming key limitations of existing foundation models through comprehensive training and evaluation.

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of
cancer-related mortality in women globally. Mammography is essential for the
early detection and diagnosis of breast lesions. Despite recent progress in
foundation models (FMs) for mammogram analysis, their clinical translation
remains constrained by several fundamental limitations, including insufficient
diversity in training data, limited model generalizability, and a lack of
comprehensive evaluation across clinically relevant tasks. Here, we introduce
VersaMammo, a versatile foundation model for mammograms, designed to overcome
these limitations. We curated the largest multi-institutional mammogram dataset
to date, comprising 706,239 images from 21 sources. To improve generalization,
we propose a two-stage pre-training strategy to develop VersaMammo, a mammogram
foundation model. First, a teacher model is trained via self-supervised
learning to extract transferable features from unlabeled mammograms. Then,
supervised learning combined with knowledge distillation transfers both
features and clinical knowledge into VersaMammo. To ensure a comprehensive
evaluation, we established a benchmark comprising 92 specific tasks, including
68 internal tasks and 24 external validation tasks, spanning 5 major clinical
task categories: lesion detection, segmentation, classification, image
retrieval, and visual question answering. VersaMammo achieves state-of-the-art
performance, ranking first in 50 out of 68 specific internal tasks and 20 out
of 24 external validation tasks, with average ranks of 1.5 and 1.2,
respectively. These results demonstrate its superior generalization and
clinical utility, offering a substantial advancement toward reliable and
scalable breast cancer screening and diagnosis.

### [70] [HiPerformer: A High-Performance Global-Local Segmentation Model with Modular Hierarchical Fusion Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20280)
*Dayu Tan,Zhenpeng Xu,Yansen Su,Xin Peng,Chunhou Zheng,Weimin Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiPerformer is a novel medical image segmentation method that addresses feature inconsistency in CNN-Transformer hybrid architectures through modular hierarchical fusion, LGFF modules for local-global integration, and PPA modules for multi-scale feature aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN-Transformer hybrid methods use simple fusion techniques that struggle with feature inconsistencies, leading to information conflict and loss. There's a need for better integration of local details and global context in medical image segmentation.

Method: HiPerformer uses a modular hierarchical encoder for dynamic parallel fusion of multi-source features, LGFF modules for precise local-global integration, and PPA modules to replace traditional skip connections for better multi-scale feature representation and noise suppression.

Result: Experiments on eleven public datasets show that HiPerformer outperforms existing segmentation techniques with higher accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses feature inconsistency problems in medical image segmentation and demonstrates superior performance through its innovative architectural design.

Abstract: Both local details and global context are crucial in medical image
segmentation, and effectively integrating them is essential for achieving high
accuracy. However, existing mainstream methods based on CNN-Transformer hybrid
architectures typically employ simple feature fusion techniques such as serial
stacking, endpoint concatenation, or pointwise addition, which struggle to
address the inconsistencies between features and are prone to information
conflict and loss. To address the aforementioned challenges, we innovatively
propose HiPerformer. The encoder of HiPerformer employs a novel modular
hierarchical architecture that dynamically fuses multi-source features in
parallel, enabling layer-wise deep integration of heterogeneous information.
The modular hierarchical design not only retains the independent modeling
capability of each branch in the encoder, but also ensures sufficient
information transfer between layers, effectively avoiding the degradation of
features and information loss that come with traditional stacking methods.
Furthermore, we design a Local-Global Feature Fusion (LGFF) module to achieve
precise and efficient integration of local details and global semantic
information, effectively alleviating the feature inconsistency problem and
resulting in a more comprehensive feature representation. To further enhance
multi-scale feature representation capabilities and suppress noise
interference, we also propose a Progressive Pyramid Aggregation (PPA) module to
replace traditional skip connections. Experiments on eleven public datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing segmentation
techniques, demonstrating higher segmentation accuracy and robustness. The code

*Haruka Kumagai,Leslie Wöhler,Satoshi Ikehata,Kiyoharu Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a human-perception-based face similarity metric to address limitations of existing binary identity classification models in face anonymization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current face anonymization methods struggle with balancing anonymity and naturalness because existing models only perform binary identity classification, lacking nuanced similarity measurements needed for optimal face swapping.

Method: Created a dataset of 6,400 triplet annotations and used metric learning to predict face similarity based on human perception.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in both face similarity prediction and attribute-based face classification tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed human-perception-based similarity metric effectively addresses the limitations of binary classification models and enables better balance between anonymity and naturalness in face swapping applications.

Abstract: In response to rising societal awareness of privacy concerns, face
anonymization techniques have advanced, including the emergence of
face-swapping methods that replace one identity with another. Achieving a
balance between anonymity and naturalness in face swapping requires careful
selection of identities: overly similar faces compromise anonymity, while
dissimilar ones reduce naturalness. Existing models, however, focus on binary
identity classification "the same person or not", making it difficult to
measure nuanced similarities such as "completely different" versus "highly
similar but different." This paper proposes a human-perception-based face
similarity metric, creating a dataset of 6,400 triplet annotations and metric
learning to predict the similarity. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in both face similarity prediction and attribute-based
face classification tasks over existing methods.

### [72] [FAST: Foreground-aware Diffusion with Accelerated Sampling Trajectory for Segmentation-oriented Anomaly Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20295)
*Xichen Xu,Yanshu Wang,Jinbao Wang,Xiaoning Lei,Guoyang Xie,Guannan Jiang,Zhichao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAST is a foreground-aware diffusion framework for industrial anomaly segmentation that introduces two novel modules: AIAS for efficient sampling and FARM for preserving anomaly signals in foreground regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing industrial anomaly synthesis methods struggle with balancing sampling efficiency and generation quality, and treat all spatial regions uniformly without considering statistical differences between anomaly and background areas.

Method: Proposes FAST framework with two modules: Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) - a training-free sampling algorithm using coarse-to-fine aggregation for efficient synthesis; and Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM) - adaptively adjusts anomaly-aware noise in masked foreground regions during denoising.

Result: FAST achieves state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented anomalies in as few as 10 steps and consistently outperforms existing methods on multiple industrial benchmarks in downstream segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed FAST framework effectively addresses the limitations of current industrial anomaly synthesis methods by providing efficient, high-quality anomaly generation with foreground-aware processing for better segmentation performance.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations,
yet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label.
Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a
promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling
efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial
regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between
anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of
controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In
this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring
two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the
Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling
algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly
synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine
aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented
anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the
anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step,
preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory.
Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST
consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream
segmentation tasks. We release the code at:

*Bishal Adhikari,Jiajia Li,Eric S. Michel,Jacob Dykes,Te-Ming Paul Tseng,Mary Love Tagert,Dong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of deep learning models for deer detection in agricultural settings, introducing a curated dataset and benchmarking 12 YOLO variants on edge computing platforms to address the economic losses from deer intrusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deer mitigation strategies are labor-intensive, costly, and ineffective for modern farming systems, causing hundreds of millions in annual losses. There's a critical need for intelligent autonomous solutions, but progress is impeded by the lack of domain-specific datasets and limited studies on on-field deployability.

Method: The study introduces a curated dataset of 3,095 annotated deer images from the Idaho Cameratraps project and conducts extensive comparative analysis of 12 model variants across four YOLO architectures (v8, v9, v10, v11). Performance is benchmarked on high-end GPU and two edge computing platforms (Raspberry Pi 5 and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier).

Result: Real-time detection is not feasible on Raspberry Pi without hardware optimization, while NVIDIA Jetson achieves >30 FPS with GPU acceleration. Smaller advanced models like YOLOv11n, YOLOv8s, and YOLOv9s offer optimal balance of high accuracy (AP@.5 > 0.85) and computational efficiency (FPS > 30).

Conclusion: The study provides practical insights for deploying deer detection systems in agricultural settings, demonstrating that architecturally advanced smaller models can achieve the necessary balance of accuracy and efficiency for real-world applications. Both dataset and source code are publicly available to support further research.

Abstract: The escalating economic losses in agriculture due to deer intrusion,
estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the U.S.,
highlight the inadequacy of traditional mitigation strategies since these
methods are often labor-intensive, costly, and ineffective for modern farming
systems. To overcome this, there is a critical need for intelligent, autonomous
solutions which require accurate and efficient deer detection. But the progress
in this field is impeded by a significant gap in the literature, mainly the
lack of a domain-specific, practical dataset and limited study on the on-field
deployability of deer detection systems. Addressing this gap, this study
presents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models
for deer detection in challenging real-world scenarios. The contributions of
this work are threefold. First, we introduce a curated, publicly available
dataset of 3,095 annotated images with bounding-box annotations of deer,
derived from the Idaho Cameratraps project. Second, we provide an extensive
comparative analysis of 12 model variants across four recent YOLO
architectures(v8, v9, v10, and v11). Finally, we benchmarked performance on a
high-end NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU and evaluated on two representative edge computing
platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. Results show that the
real-time detection is not feasible in Raspberry Pi without hardware-specific
model optimization, while NVIDIA Jetson provides greater than 30 FPS with
GPU-accelerated inference on 's' and 'n' series models. This study also reveals
that smaller, architecturally advanced models such as YOLOv11n, YOLOv8s, and
YOLOv9s offer the optimal balance of high accuracy (AP@.5 > 0.85) and
computational efficiency (FPS > 30). To support further research, both the
source code and datasets are publicly available at

*Qi Li,Shuwen Qiu,Julien Han,Xingzi Xu,Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu,Kee Kiat Koo,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes methods to incorporate pose control into Virtual Try-On (VTON) models using spatial concatenation of pose data without adding parameters, with pose maps showing best results and a mixed-mask training strategy for flexible product integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As online shopping grows, VTON technology needs effective pose control to ensure accurate product alignment with user's body while supporting diverse orientations for immersive experiences, but current methods face challenges in pose representation selection, integration without additional parameters, and balancing pose preservation with control.

Method: Builds on baseline VTON model using pure concatenation paradigm, investigates pose control by spatially concatenating pose data (comparing pose maps vs skeletons) without adding parameters, and introduces mixed-mask training strategy using fine-grained and bounding box masks.

Result: Experiments show pose stitching with pose maps yields best results, enhancing both pose preservation and output realism, while mixed-mask training enables flexible product integration across varied poses and conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully incorporates pose control into VTON models through spatial concatenation and mixed-mask training, achieving improved pose preservation and realistic outputs without increasing model complexity.

Abstract: As online shopping continues to grow, the demand for Virtual Try-On (VTON)
technology has surged, allowing customers to visualize products on themselves
by overlaying product images onto their own photos. An essential yet
challenging condition for effective VTON is pose control, which ensures
accurate alignment of products with the user's body while supporting diverse
orientations for a more immersive experience. However, incorporating pose
conditions into VTON models presents several challenges, including selecting
the optimal pose representation, integrating poses without additional
parameters, and balancing pose preservation with flexible pose control.
  In this work, we build upon a baseline VTON model that concatenates the
reference image condition without external encoder, control network, or complex
attention layers. We investigate methods to incorporate pose control into this
pure concatenation paradigm by spatially concatenating pose data, comparing
performance using pose maps and skeletons, without adding any additional
parameters or module to the baseline model. Our experiments reveal that pose
stitching with pose maps yields the best results, enhancing both pose
preservation and output realism. Additionally, we introduce a mixed-mask
training strategy using fine-grained and bounding box masks, allowing the model
to support flexible product integration across varied poses and conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysCtrl is a physics-grounded framework for image-to-video generation that incorporates physical parameters and force control to produce physically plausible and 3D-controllable videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models lack physical plausibility and 3D controllability, limiting their realism and practical applications in scenarios requiring accurate physical dynamics.

Method: Uses a generative physics network with diffusion models conditioned on physics parameters and forces, representing dynamics as 3D point trajectories. Includes spatiotemporal attention blocks for particle interactions and physics-based constraints during training.

Result: Generates realistic, physics-grounded motion trajectories that drive image-to-video models to produce high-fidelity, controllable videos superior to existing methods in both visual quality and physical plausibility.

Conclusion: PhysCtrl successfully bridges the gap between video generation and physical realism, enabling controllable and physically accurate video synthesis across multiple material types.

Abstract: Existing video generation models excel at producing photo-realistic videos
from text or images, but often lack physical plausibility and 3D
controllability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PhysCtrl, a novel
framework for physics-grounded image-to-video generation with physical
parameters and force control. At its core is a generative physics network that
learns the distribution of physical dynamics across four materials (elastic,
sand, plasticine, and rigid) via a diffusion model conditioned on physics
parameters and applied forces. We represent physical dynamics as 3D point
trajectories and train on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 550K animations
generated by physics simulators. We enhance the diffusion model with a novel
spatiotemporal attention block that emulates particle interactions and
incorporates physics-based constraints during training to enforce physical
plausibility. Experiments show that PhysCtrl generates realistic,
physics-grounded motion trajectories which, when used to drive image-to-video
models, yield high-fidelity, controllable videos that outperform existing
methods in both visual quality and physical plausibility. Project Page:

TL;DR: EditVerse is a unified framework for image and video generation/editing using a single model that represents all modalities as unified token sequences, achieving state-of-the-art performance through self-attention and scalable data curation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generation and editing remain fragmented due to architectural limitations and data scarcity, while image tasks have successfully transitioned to unified frameworks. There's a need for a comprehensive approach that handles both image and video modalities.

Method: Represents text, image, and video as unified token sequences using self-attention for in-context learning and cross-modal knowledge transfer. Creates scalable data pipeline with 232K video editing samples combined with large-scale image/video datasets for joint training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing open-source and commercial models. Demonstrates emergent editing and generation abilities across modalities through extensive experiments and user studies.

Conclusion: EditVerse successfully unifies image and video generation/editing in a single framework, addressing data scarcity through innovative data curation and establishing EditVerseBench as the first benchmark for instruction-based video editing.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models highlight a clear trend toward
unification and scaling, showing emergent capabilities across diverse domains.
While image generation and editing have rapidly transitioned from task-specific
to unified frameworks, video generation and editing remain fragmented due to
architectural limitations and data scarcity. In this work, we introduce
EditVerse, a unified framework for image and video generation and editing
within a single model. By representing all modalities, i.e., text, image, and
video, as a unified token sequence, EditVerse leverages self-attention to
achieve robust in-context learning, natural cross-modal knowledge transfer, and
flexible handling of inputs and outputs with arbitrary resolutions and
durations. To address the lack of video editing training data, we design a
scalable data pipeline that curates 232K video editing samples and combines
them with large-scale image and video datasets for joint training. Furthermore,
we present EditVerseBench, the first benchmark for instruction-based video
editing covering diverse tasks and resolutions. Extensive experiments and user
studies demonstrate that EditVerse achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing existing open-source and commercial models, while exhibiting
emergent editing and generation abilities across modalities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-assisted item neutralization reduces social desirability bias in personality tests, showing preserved reliability but inconsistent bias reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address social desirability bias in personality assessments using AI-powered item neutralization techniques.

Method: Used GPT-3 to rewrite IPIP-BFM-50 personality items, then compared original vs neutralized versions with 203 participants using social desirability scales.

Result: Neutralized items maintained reliability and factor structure, reduced some social desirability correlations but inconsistently, and showed configural but not metric/scalar invariance.

Conclusion: AI neutralization is a promising but imperfect method for reducing social desirability bias in personality assessment.

Abstract: This study evaluates item neutralization assisted by the large language model
(LLM) to reduce social desirability bias in personality assessment. GPT-o3 was
used to rewrite the International Personality Item Pool Big Five Measure
(IPIP-BFM-50), and 203 participants completed either the original or
neutralized form along with the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale. The
results showed preserved reliability and a five-factor structure, with gains in
Conscientiousness and declines in Agreeableness and Openness. The correlations
with social desirability decreased for several items, but inconsistently.
Configural invariance held, though metric and scalar invariance failed.
Findings support AI neutralization as a potential but imperfect bias-reduction
method.

*Gyubok Lee,Elea Bach,Eric Yang,Tom Pollard,Alistair Johnson,Edward Choi,Yugang jia,Jong Ha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FHIR-AgentBench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on clinical data using the HL7 FHIR standard, addressing the gap in existing benchmarks for interoperable clinical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack realism needed to evaluate LLMs on interoperable clinical data following the shift to HL7 FHIR standard, creating a need for more realistic evaluation frameworks.

Method: Created a benchmark with 2,931 real-world clinical questions grounded in HL7 FHIR standard, systematically evaluating agentic frameworks with different data retrieval strategies, interaction patterns, and reasoning approaches.

Result: Experiments revealed practical challenges in retrieving data from complex FHIR resources and reasoning over them, both critically impacting question answering performance.

Conclusion: The FHIR-AgentBench dataset and evaluation suite are publicly released to promote reproducible research and development of robust LLM agents for clinical applications.

Abstract: The recent shift toward the Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) standard opens a new frontier for
clinical AI, demanding LLM agents to navigate complex, resource-based data
models instead of conventional structured health data. However, existing
benchmarks have lagged behind this transition, lacking the realism needed to
evaluate recent LLMs on interoperable clinical data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce FHIR-AgentBench, a benchmark that grounds 2,931 real-world clinical
questions in the HL7 FHIR standard. Using this benchmark, we systematically
evaluate agentic frameworks, comparing different data retrieval strategies
(direct FHIR API calls vs. specialized tools), interaction patterns
(single-turn vs. multi-turn), and reasoning strategies (natural language vs.
code generation). Our experiments highlight the practical challenges of
retrieving data from intricate FHIR resources and the difficulty of reasoning
over them, both of which critically affect question answering performance. We
publicly release the FHIR-AgentBench dataset and evaluation suite
(https://github.com/glee4810/FHIR-AgentBench) to promote reproducible research
and the development of robust, reliable LLM agents for clinical applications.

*Millie Vyas,Timothy Blattner,Alden Dima*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A specification called Readme_AI Model Context Protocol (MCP) that dynamically builds context for LLMs using data source metadata to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often provide inaccurate or unreliable information for specific queries despite extensive training, and query-specific context significantly improves response quality.

Method: Data source owners create metadata files that LLMs use to reason about dataset-related queries. The protocol supports extensible types including web-page crawling, data repository fetching, publication parsing, and general text, with context formatted using user-specified tags.

Result: The prototype successfully enabled LLMs to provide accurate responses about the NIST Hedgehog library, including generating code from examples, whereas common LLMs previously produced inaccurate and hallucinated responses.

Conclusion: The primary contribution is an extensible protocol for dynamically grounding LLMs in specialized, owner-provided data, which enhances LLM responses and reduces hallucinations.

Abstract: Despite being trained on significant amounts of data, Large Language Models
(LLMs) can provide inaccurate or unreliable information in the context of a
user's specific query. Given query-specific context significantly improves the
usefulness of its responses. In this paper, we present a specification that can
be used to dynamically build context for data sources. The data source owner
creates the file containing metadata for LLMs to use when reasoning about
dataset-related queries. To demonstrate our proposed specification, we created
a prototype Readme_AI Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that retrieves the
metadata from the data source and uses it to dynamically build context. Some
features that make this specification dynamic are the extensible types that
represent crawling web-pages, fetching data from data repositories, downloading
and parsing publications, and general text. The context is formatted and
grouped using user-specified tags that provide clear contextual information for
the LLM to reason about the content. We demonstrate the capabilities of this
early prototype by asking the LLM about the NIST-developed Hedgehog library,
for which common LLMs often provides inaccurate and irrelevant responses
containing hallucinations. With Readme_AI, the LLM receives enough context that
it is now able to reason about the library and its use, and even generate code
interpolated from examples that were included in the Readme_AI file provided by
Hedgehog's developer. Our primary contribution is a extensible protocol for
dynamically grounding LLMs in specialized, owner-provided data, enhancing
responses from LLMs and reducing hallucinations. The source code for the
Readme_AI tool is posted here: https://github.com/usnistgov/readme_ai .

### [80] [Magnitude Matters: a Superior Class of Similarity Metrics for Holistic Semantic Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19323)
*V. S. Raghu Parupudi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes new magnitude-aware similarity metrics (Overlap Similarity and Hyperbolic Tangent Similarity) that outperform traditional dot product and cosine similarity on paraphrase and inference tasks, while identifying limitations for compositional semantics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vector comparison standards (dot product and cosine similarity) have limitations - dot product is unbounded and norm-sensitive, while cosine similarity discards magnitude information entirely. The paper aims to develop better metrics that integrate both magnitude and alignment information.

Method: The authors introduced two parameter-free, magnitude-aware similarity functions: Overlap Similarity (OS) and Hyperbolic Tangent Similarity (HTS). They conducted comprehensive evaluation using four state-of-the-art sentence embedding models across eight NLP benchmarks, using Wilcoxon signed-rank test for statistical significance.

Result: Both OS and HTS provided statistically significant improvement in Mean Squared Error over dot product and cosine similarity on tasks requiring holistic semantic understanding (paraphrase and inference). However, no significant improvement was observed on benchmarks testing nuanced compositional semantics (SICK, STS-B).

Conclusion: Magnitude-aware metrics offer statistically superior performance for paraphrase and inference tasks, but compositional text representation remains a distinct challenge for future work.

Abstract: Vector comparison in high dimensions is a fundamental task in NLP, yet it is
dominated by two baselines: the raw dot product, which is unbounded and
sensitive to vector norms, and the cosine similarity, which discards magnitude
information entirely. This paper challenges both standards by proposing and
rigorously evaluating a new class of parameter-free, magnitude-aware similarity
metrics. I introduce two such functions, Overlap Similarity (OS) and Hyperbolic
Tangent Similarity (HTS), designed to integrate vector magnitude and alignment
in a more principled manner. To ensure that my findings are robust and
generalizable, I conducted a comprehensive evaluation using four
state-of-the-art sentence embedding models (all-MiniLM-L6-v2,
all-mpnet-base-v2, paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2, and BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) across
a diverse suite of eight standard NLP benchmarks, including STS-B, SICK, Quora,
and PAWS. Using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for statistical significance, my
results are definitive: on the tasks requiring holistic semantic understanding
(paraphrase and inference), both OS and HTS provide a statistically significant
improvement in Mean Squared Error over both the raw dot product and cosine
similarity, regardless of the underlying embedding model.Crucially, my findings
delineate the specific domain of advantage for these metrics: for tasks
requiring holistic semantic understanding like paraphrase and inference, my
magnitude-aware metrics offer a statistically superior alternative. This
significant improvement was not observed on benchmarks designed to test highly
nuanced compositional semantics (SICK, STS-B), identifying the challenge of
representing compositional text as a distinct and important direction for
future work.

### [81] [How Much of Your Data Can Suck? Thresholds for Domain Performance and Emergent Misalignment in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19325)
*Jian Ouyang,Arman T,Ge Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how incorrect data during supervised fine-tuning affects GPT-4o's performance and safety, showing that even small amounts (10-25%) of incorrect data significantly degrade domain performance without affecting moral alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are increasingly used in critical domains like finance, health, and law, but fine-tuning on incorrect data can cause "emergent misalignment" leading to harmful outputs unrelated to intended tasks.

Method: Evaluated GPT-4o models fine-tuned with varying ratios (10% to 90% correct) of obviously and subtly incorrect data across coding, finance, health, and legal domains.

Result: Even modest incorrect data (10-25%) dramatically degrades domain performance. Models need at least 50% correct data to recover performance, but rarely match the base model's robustness and safety (which shows near-perfect alignment).

Conclusion: The cost of incorrect data is heavy, emphasizing the critical need for extremely high-quality data curation or using robust base models without unnecessary fine-tuning for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of incorrect data on the performance and
safety of large language models (LLMs), specifically gpt-4o, during supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Although LLMs become increasingly vital across broad domains
like finance, coding, law, and health, fine-tuning on incorrect data can lead
to "emergent misalignment," producing harmful or deceptive outputs unrelated to
the intended task. We evaluate gpt-4o models fine-tuned with varying ratios
(10\% to 90\% correct) of both obviously and subtly incorrect data across four
domains: coding, finance, health, and legal. Our findings show that even modest
amounts of incorrect data (10-25\%) dramatically degrade domain performance and
not moral alignment. A clear threshold of at least 50\% correct data is needed
for models to consistently recover strong performance, though they rarely match
the robustness and safety of the base model, which exhibits near-perfect
alignment and zero dangerous completions out-of-the-box. This research
emphasizes that the cost of incorrect data is heavy, highlighting the critical
need for extremely high-quality data curation or, alternatively, leveraging
robust base models without unnecessary fine-tuning for high-stakes
applications.

### [82] [Unveiling the Merits and Defects of LLMs in Automatic Review Generation for Scientific Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19326)
*Ruochi Li,Haoxuan Zhang,Edward Gehringer,Ting Xiao,Junhua Ding,Haihua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLM-generated peer reviews against human reviews using a comprehensive framework, finding LLMs excel at descriptive content but struggle with critical reasoning and quality sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing strain on traditional peer-review processes and the need to assess LLMs' capabilities for automated review generation, particularly their limitations in critical reasoning and contextual understanding.

Method: Proposed a comprehensive evaluation framework using semantic similarity analysis and structured knowledge graph metrics. Constructed a large-scale benchmark of 1,683 papers and 6,495 expert reviews from ICLR and NeurIPS, generating reviews with five LLMs.

Result: LLMs perform well in descriptive content (GPT-4o generated 15.74% more entities in strengths sections) but significantly underperform in identifying weaknesses (GPT-4o produced 59.42% fewer entities) and adjusting feedback based on paper quality (only 5.7% increase in node count vs. 50% in human reviews).

Conclusion: LLMs have merits for descriptive review generation but critical defects in critical reasoning and quality sensitivity, providing empirical foundations for developing future LLM-assisted reviewing tools.

Abstract: The surge in scientific submissions has placed increasing strain on the
traditional peer-review process, prompting the exploration of large language
models (LLMs) for automated review generation. While LLMs demonstrate
competence in producing structured and coherent feedback, their capacity for
critical reasoning, contextual grounding, and quality sensitivity remains
limited. To systematically evaluate these aspects, we propose a comprehensive
evaluation framework that integrates semantic similarity analysis and
structured knowledge graph metrics to assess LLM-generated reviews against
human-written counterparts. We construct a large-scale benchmark of 1,683
papers and 6,495 expert reviews from ICLR and NeurIPS in multiple years, and
generate reviews using five LLMs. Our findings show that LLMs perform well in
descriptive and affirmational content, capturing the main contributions and
methodologies of the original work, with GPT-4o highlighted as an illustrative
example, generating 15.74% more entities than human reviewers in the strengths
section of good papers in ICLR 2025. However, they consistently underperform in
identifying weaknesses, raising substantive questions, and adjusting feedback
based on paper quality. GPT-4o produces 59.42% fewer entities than real
reviewers in the weaknesses and increases node count by only 5.7% from good to
weak papers, compared to 50% in human reviews. Similar trends are observed
across all conferences, years, and models, providing empirical foundations for
understanding the merits and defects of LLM-generated reviews and informing the
development of future LLM-assisted reviewing tools. Data, code, and more

### [83] [A systematic review of trial-matching pipelines using large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19327)
*Braxton A. Morrison,Madhumita Sushil,Jacob S. Young*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic review of LLM-based approaches for clinical trial matching from 2020-2025, analyzing 31 studies that show GPT-4 consistently outperforms other models but faces challenges with data access, cost, and deployment risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual clinical trial matching is labor-intensive and error-prone, leading to recruitment delays. LLM-based pipelines offer a promising automated solution to improve efficiency and accuracy in matching patients to appropriate clinical trials.

Method: Conducted systematic review of studies from three academic databases and one preprint server (2020-2025), identifying 31 eligible articles. Analyzed approaches including patient-to-criterion matching, patient-to-trial matching, trial-to-patient matching, binary eligibility classification, and combined tasks using both synthetic and real patient data.

Result: GPT-4 consistently outperformed other models in matching and eligibility extraction, even fine-tuned models, though at higher cost. Promising strategies included zero-shot prompting with proprietary LLMs, advanced retrieval methods, and fine-tuning smaller open-source models for data privacy. Key challenges identified were dataset variability, limited cross-study comparability, and deployment issues.

Conclusion: LLMs show significant promise for clinical trial matching, but broader deployment requires standardized metrics, more realistic test sets, and attention to cost-efficiency, fairness, and mitigation of hallucinations, data leakage, and bias.

Abstract: Matching patients to clinical trial options is critical for identifying novel
treatments, especially in oncology. However, manual matching is labor-intensive
and error-prone, leading to recruitment delays. Pipelines incorporating large
language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution. We conducted a systematic
review of studies published between 2020 and 2025 from three academic databases
and one preprint server, identifying LLM-based approaches to clinical trial
matching. Of 126 unique articles, 31 met inclusion criteria. Reviewed studies
focused on matching patient-to-criterion only (n=4), patient-to-trial only
(n=10), trial-to-patient only (n=2), binary eligibility classification only
(n=1) or combined tasks (n=14). Sixteen used synthetic data; fourteen used real
patient data; one used both. Variability in datasets and evaluation metrics
limited cross-study comparability. In studies with direct comparisons, the
GPT-4 model consistently outperformed other models, even finely-tuned ones, in
matching and eligibility extraction, albeit at higher cost. Promising
strategies included zero-shot prompting with proprietary LLMs like the GPT-4o
model, advanced retrieval methods, and fine-tuning smaller, open-source models
for data privacy when incorporation of large models into hospital
infrastructure is infeasible. Key challenges include accessing sufficiently
large real-world data sets, and deployment-associated challenges such as
reducing cost, mitigating risk of hallucinations, data leakage, and bias. This
review synthesizes progress in applying LLMs to clinical trial matching,
highlighting promising directions and key limitations. Standardized metrics,
more realistic test sets, and attention to cost-efficiency and fairness will be
critical for broader deployment.

### [84] [How Model Size, Temperature, and Prompt Style Affect LLM-Human Assessment Score Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19329)
*Julie Jung,Max Lu,Sina Chole Benker,Dogus Darici*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Model size is the key factor affecting LLM-human alignment in clinical reasoning assessment, with temperature and prompt style also influencing self-alignment and inter-model alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how model size, temperature, and prompt style affect LLMs' alignment with themselves, other models, and human judgments in clinical reasoning evaluation.

Method: Examined the effects of model size, temperature, and prompt style on LLM alignment across three levels: self-alignment (within the same model), inter-model alignment (between different models), and human-model alignment in clinical reasoning assessment.

Result: Model size was identified as the primary factor influencing LLM-human score alignment. The study also found that temperature and prompt style affect self-alignment and inter-model alignment.

Conclusion: The research highlights the critical importance of checking alignments across multiple levels (self, inter-model, and human) when evaluating LLMs for clinical reasoning tasks, with model size being particularly crucial for human alignment.

Abstract: We examined how model size, temperature, and prompt style affect Large
Language Models' (LLMs) alignment within itself, between models, and with human
in assessing clinical reasoning skills. Model size emerged as a key factor in
LLM-human score alignment. Study highlights the importance of checking
alignments across multiple levels.

### [85] [Quantifying Compositionality of Classic and State-of-the-Art Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19332)
*Zhijin Guo,Chenhao Xue,Zhaozhen Xu,Hongbo Bo,Yuxuan Ye,Janet B. Pierrehumbert,Martha Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a two-step evaluation framework to quantify additive compositionality in language models, tracking how well models can combine known attributes to understand novel expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer and graph models lack proper limits on meaning shifts due to context, while older models made excessive claims about compositionality. The authors aim to provide a rigorous way to measure how well models generalize compositionally.

Method: A two-step evaluation: (1) measure linearity between entity attributes and embeddings via canonical correlation analysis, (2) evaluate additive generalization by reconstructing embeddings for unseen attribute combinations and checking reconstruction metrics (L2 loss, cosine similarity, retrieval accuracy).

Result: Stronger compositional signals are observed in later training stages across data modalities, and in deeper layers of transformer models before a decline at the top layer.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively quantifies compositionality and reveals important patterns in how models develop compositional understanding during training.

Abstract: For language models to generalize correctly to novel expressions, it is
critical that they exploit access compositional meanings when this is
justified. Even if we don't know what a "pelp" is, we can use our knowledge of
numbers to understand that "ten pelps" makes more pelps than "two pelps".
Static word embeddings such as Word2vec made strong, indeed excessive, claims
about compositionality. The SOTA generative, transformer models and graph
models, however, go too far in the other direction by providing no real limits
on shifts in meaning due to context. To quantify the additive compositionality,
we formalize a two-step, generalized evaluation that (i) measures the linearity
between known entity attributes and their embeddings via canonical correlation
analysis, and (ii) evaluates additive generalization by reconstructing
embeddings for unseen attribute combinations and checking reconstruction
metrics such as L2 loss, cosine similarity, and retrieval accuracy. These
metrics also capture failure cases where linear composition breaks down.
Sentences, knowledge graphs, and word embeddings are evaluated and tracked the
compositionality across all layers and training stages. Stronger compositional
signals are observed in later training stages across data modalities, and in
deeper layers of the transformer-based model before a decline at the top layer.

### [86] [Pluralistic Off-policy Evaluation and Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19333)
*Chengkai Huang,Junda Wu,Zhouhang Xie,Yu Xia,Rui Wang,Tong Yu,Subrata Mitra,Julian McAuley,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: POPE is a framework for offline pluralistic preference evaluation and alignment in LLMs that combines collaborative utility and diversity components using decomposable IPS estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference alignment methods ignore preference pluralism and focus solely on overall utility, while most datasets are logged under policies that differ from evaluated LLMs.

Method: Proposes a unified reward function with collaborative utility and diversity components, and derives decomposable inverse propensity scoring (IPS) estimators to separately evaluate relevance and diversity.

Result: Empirical results show POPE efficiently enhances pluralistic response generation while maintaining models' general capabilities on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: POPE successfully addresses the open problem of extending Off-Policy Evaluation to pluralistic preference alignment, providing both theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Personalized preference alignment for LLMs with diverse human preferences
requires evaluation and alignment methods that capture pluralism. Most existing
preference alignment datasets are logged under policies that differ
substantially from the evaluated LLMs, and existing off-policy estimators focus
solely on overall utility while ignoring preference pluralism. Extending
Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) to pluralistic preference alignment, therefore,
remains an open question. Thus, we propose the Pluralistic Off-Policy
Evaluation (POPE), the first framework for offline pluralistic preference
evaluation and alignment in LLMs. POPE includes a unified reward function that
combines (1) a collaborative utility component derived from human preference
signals (e.g., upvotes or relevance scores) and (2) a diversity component
inspired by entropy-based coverage measures, together reflecting pluralistic
alignment. Furthermore, to estimate this reward from logged interactions, we
derive decomposable inverse propensity scoring (IPS) estimators that separately
evaluate relevance and diversity. Theoretically, we prove that our decomposed
IPS estimators establish a lower bound on their variance. With the off-policy
evaluated value function, we can directly enable off-policy optimization to
further enhance pluralistic alignment. Empirical results demonstrate that POPE
efficiently enhances pluralistic response generation and maintains the models'
general capabilities on downstream tasks

### [87] [Cognitive-Level Adaptive Generation via Capability-Aware Retrieval and Style Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19336)
*Qingsong Wang,Tao Wu,Wang Lin,Yueying Feng,Gongsheng Yuan,Chang Yao,Jingyuan Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLAF framework addresses cognitive misalignment in LLMs by aligning knowledge complexity and presentation style with user cognition through capability-aware retrieval, style optimization, and knowledge-controllable generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to adapt content to users with different cognitive capacities, leading to knowledge-level and presentation-style misalignment that hinders effective comprehension.

Method: Proposes CLAF framework with: 1) capability-aware retrieval using hierarchical knowledge graph, 2) style optimization guided by Bloom's taxonomy and preference learning, 3) knowledge-controllable generation for consistency. Uses SCALE dataset for training/evaluation.

Result: Empirical results show CLAF enhances adaptability and informativeness of LLM outputs across diverse user profiles.

Conclusion: CLAF offers a robust solution to cognitive-level alignment in real-world LLM applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
open-ended generation tasks. However, they often struggle to adapt content to
users with differing cognitive capacities, leading to a phenomenon we term
cognitive misalignment. This issue arises in two forms: knowledge-level
misalignment, where content is too complex or too simplistic relative to user
understanding, and presentation-style misalignment, where the structure or tone
hinders effective comprehension. To address these challenges, we propose the
Cognitive-Level Alignment Framework (CLAF), a general-purpose generation
framework that aligns both knowledge complexity and presentation style with
user cognition. CLAF integrates a capability-aware retrieval module based on a
hierarchical knowledge graph and a style optimization module guided by Bloom's
taxonomy and preference learning. Additionally, a knowledge-controllable
generation component ensures consistency and relevance throughout the output.
To support training and evaluation, we construct SCALE, a cognitively annotated
dataset containing responses at multiple comprehension levels per query.
Empirical results show that CLAF enhances the adaptability and informativeness
of LLM outputs across a range of user profiles, offering a robust solution to
cognitive-level alignment in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nagamese is an under-resourced creole language with no existing POS tagging work, unlike resource-rich languages like English and Hindi.

Method: Created annotated corpus of 16,112 tokens and applied Conditional Random Fields (CRF) machine learning technique for POS tagging.

Result: Achieved overall tagging accuracy of 85.70% with precision of 86%, recall of 86%, and f1-score of 85%.

Conclusion: Successfully demonstrated the first POS tagging system for Nagamese language with promising results using CRF approach.

Abstract: This paper investigates part-of-speech tagging, an important task in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) for the Nagamese language. The Nagamese language,
a.k.a. Naga Pidgin, is an Assamese-lexified Creole language developed primarily
as a means of communication in trade between the Nagas and people from Assam in
northeast India. A substantial amount of work in part-of-speech-tagging has
been done for resource-rich languages like English, Hindi, etc. However, no
work has been done in the Nagamese language. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first attempt at part-of-speech tagging for the Nagamese Language. The
aim of this work is to identify the part-of-speech for a given sentence in the
Nagamese language. An annotated corpus of 16,112 tokens is created and applied
machine learning technique known as Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Using CRF,
an overall tagging accuracy of 85.70%; precision, recall of 86%, and f1-score
of 85% is achieved.

*Renyu Li,Antonio Jimeno Yepes,Yao You,Kamil Pluciński,Maximilian Operlejn,Crag Wolfe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCORE is a new evaluation framework for multi-modal generative document parsing that addresses limitations of traditional metrics by being interpretation-agnostic and handling structural diversity while maintaining semantic rigor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluation metrics (CER, WER, IoU, TEDS) misclassify semantically correct but structurally divergent outputs from generative document parsing systems as errors, penalizing valid interpretations and obscuring true system performance.

Method: SCORE integrates four components: (1) adjusted edit distance for content fidelity, (2) token-level diagnostics to distinguish hallucinations from omissions, (3) table evaluation with spatial tolerance and semantic alignment, and (4) hierarchy-aware consistency checks. It normalizes generative outputs into format-agnostic representations.

Result: Across 1,114 pages, SCORE revealed cross-dataset performance patterns missed by standard metrics. In ambiguous table structures (2-5% of pages), traditional metrics penalized systems by 12-25% on average, while SCORE corrected these cases. SCORE achieved table F1 scores up to 0.93 without requiring object-detection pipelines.

Conclusion: SCORE establishes foundational principles for semantically grounded, fair, and practical benchmarking of modern document parsing systems by exposing how interpretive diversity impacts evaluation and providing multi-dimensional, interpretable diagnostics.

Abstract: Multi-modal generative document parsing systems challenge traditional
evaluation: unlike deterministic OCR or layout models, they often produce
semantically correct yet structurally divergent outputs. Conventional
metrics-CER, WER, IoU, or TEDS-misclassify such diversity as error, penalizing
valid interpretations and obscuring system behavior.
  We introduce SCORE (Structural and COntent Robust Evaluation), an
interpretation-agnostic framework that integrates (i) adjusted edit distance
for robust content fidelity, (ii) token-level diagnostics to distinguish
hallucinations from omissions, (iii) table evaluation with spatial tolerance
and semantic alignment, and (iv) hierarchy-aware consistency checks. Together,
these dimensions enable evaluation that embraces representational diversity
while enforcing semantic rigor.
  Across 1,114 pages spanning a holistic benchmark and a field dataset, SCORE
consistently revealed cross-dataset performance patterns missed by standard
metrics. In 2-5% of pages with ambiguous table structures, traditional metrics
penalized systems by 12-25% on average, leading to distorted rankings. SCORE
corrected these cases, recovering equivalence between alternative but valid
interpretations. Moreover, by normalizing generative outputs into a
format-agnostic representation, SCORE reproduces traditional scores (e.g.,
table F1 up to 0.93) without requiring object-detection pipelines,
demonstrating that generative parsing alone suffices for comprehensive
evaluation.
  By exposing how interpretive diversity impacts evaluation outcomes and
providing multi-dimensional, interpretable diagnostics, SCORE establishes
foundational principles for semantically grounded, fair, and practical
benchmarking of modern document parsing systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of prior research that focuses on either lexicon-based strategies or deep learning models in isolation, and to conduct an extensive investigation into user satisfaction with LLM-based applications.

Method: Collected 4,000 authentic user reviews, preprocessed data, applied oversampling for balanced classes, and tested models on 1,700 reviews using TextBlob for lexicon analysis and CNN/Bi-LSTM for deep learning classification.

Result: ChatGPT received significantly more positive sentiment than DeepSeek. CNN outperformed Bi-LSTM with 96.41% accuracy and near-perfect classification of negative reviews, while achieving high F1-scores for neutral and positive sentiments.

Conclusion: The research establishes a new methodological standard for sentiment analysis in LLM applications and provides practical insights for improving user-centric AI system design.

Abstract: This study presents a novel dual-perspective approach to analyzing user
reviews for ChatGPT and DeepSeek on the Google Play Store, integrating
lexicon-based sentiment analysis (TextBlob) with deep learning classification
models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long
Short Term Memory (Bi LSTM) Networks. Unlike prior research, which focuses on
either lexicon-based strategies or predictive deep learning models in
isolation, this study conducts an extensive investigation into user
satisfaction with Large Language Model (LLM) based applications. A Dataset of
4,000 authentic user reviews was collected, which were carefully preprocessed
and subjected to oversampling to achieve balanced classes. The balanced test
set of 1,700 Reviews were used for model testing. Results from the experiments
reveal that ChatGPT received significantly more positive sentiment than
DeepSeek. Furthermore, deep learning based classification demonstrated superior
performance over lexicon analysis, with CNN outperforming Bi-LSTM by achieving
96.41 percent accuracy and near perfect classification of negative reviews,
alongside high F1-scores for neutral and positive sentiments. This research

TL;DR: The paper proposes using cognitive psychology complexity frameworks to characterize LLM-KG tasks, revealing value distributions and underrepresented demands to improve benchmark evaluation diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-KG evaluation focuses mainly on accuracy and correctness, lacking comprehensive task characterization that considers cognitive complexity dimensions.

Method: Apply three complexity frameworks from cognitive psychology to the LLM-KG-Bench framework to analyze task demands and value distributions.

Result: The analysis highlights underrepresented task demands and value distributions, suggesting current benchmarks may not fully capture the complexity of LLM-KG interactions.

Conclusion: Using cognitive psychology frameworks enables richer interpretation and diversity in benchmark evaluation tasks for LLM-KG applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks involving
Knowledge Graphs (KGs), whose evaluation typically focuses on accuracy and
output correctness. We propose a complementary task characterization approach
using three complexity frameworks from cognitive psychology. Applying this to
the LLM-KG-Bench framework, we highlight value distributions, identify
underrepresented demands and motivate richer interpretation and diversity for
benchmark evaluation tasks.

TL;DR: ShinkaEvolve is an open-source framework that uses LLMs for scientific discovery with improved sample efficiency and solution quality through evolutionary algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code evolution methods are sample inefficient (requiring thousands of samples) and remain closed-source, limiting adoption and extension in scientific discovery applications.

Method: Three key innovations: parent sampling balancing exploration/exploitation, code novelty rejection-sampling for efficient search, and bandit-based LLM ensemble selection strategy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art circle packing solution with only 150 samples, designs high-performing agentic harnesses for AIME tasks, improves ALE-Bench solutions, and discovers novel mixture-of-expert loss functions.

Conclusion: ShinkaEvolve democratizes open-ended discovery across computational problems through open-source accessibility, cost-efficiency, and broad applicability with exceptional sample efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce ShinkaEvolve: a new open-source framework leveraging large
language models (LLMs) to advance scientific discovery with state-of-the-art
performance and unprecedented efficiency. Recent advances in scaling inference
time compute of LLMs have enabled significant progress in generalized
scientific discovery. These approaches rely on evolutionary agentic harnesses
that leverage LLMs as mutation operators to generate candidate solutions.
However, current code evolution methods suffer from critical limitations: they
are sample inefficient, requiring thousands of samples to identify effective
solutions, and remain closed-source, hindering broad adoption and extension.
ShinkaEvolve addresses these limitations, introducing three key innovations: a
parent sampling technique balancing exploration and exploitation, code novelty
rejection-sampling for efficient search space exploration, and a bandit-based
LLM ensemble selection strategy. We evaluate ShinkaEvolve across diverse tasks,
demonstrating consistent improvements in sample efficiency and solution
quality. ShinkaEvolve discovers a new state-of-the-art circle packing solution
using only 150 samples, designs high-performing agentic harnesses for AIME
mathematical reasoning tasks, identifies improvements to ALE-Bench competitive
programming solutions, and discovers novel mixture-of-expert load balancing
loss functions that illuminate the space of optimization strategies. Our
results demonstrate that ShinkaEvolve achieves broad applicability with
exceptional sample efficiency. By providing open-source accessibility and
cost-efficiency, this work democratizes open-ended discovery across diverse

### [94] [TriSPrompt: A Hierarchical Soft Prompt Model for Multimodal Rumor Detection with Incomplete Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19352)
*Jiajun Chen,Yangyang Wu,Xiaoye Miao,Mengying Zhu,Meng Xi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TriSPrompt is a hierarchical soft prompt model that addresses incomplete multimodal data in rumor detection by using three types of prompts to handle modality-aware information, missing modalities, and mutual views between subjective and objective perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal rumor detection methods fail to handle the common occurrence of missing modalities in real-world data, which limits their effectiveness in practical scenarios.

Method: The proposed TriSPrompt model integrates three prompts: modality-aware (MA) prompt for capturing heterogeneous and homogeneous features, modality-missing (MM) prompt for modeling missing states, and mutual-views (MV) prompt for learning relationships between subjective (text/image) and objective (comments) perspectives.

Result: Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks show that TriSPrompt achieves over 13% accuracy gain compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TriSPrompt effectively addresses the challenge of incomplete multimodal data in rumor detection and demonstrates superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: The widespread presence of incomplete modalities in multimodal data poses a
significant challenge to achieving accurate rumor detection. Existing
multimodal rumor detection methods primarily focus on learning joint modality
representations from \emph{complete} multimodal training data, rendering them
ineffective in addressing the common occurrence of \emph{missing modalities} in
real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical soft prompt
model \textsf{TriSPrompt}, which integrates three types of prompts,
\textit{i.e.}, \emph{modality-aware} (MA) prompt, \emph{modality-missing} (MM)
prompt, and \emph{mutual-views} (MV) prompt, to effectively detect rumors in
incomplete multimodal data. The MA prompt captures both heterogeneous
information from specific modalities and homogeneous features from available
data, aiding in modality recovery. The MM prompt models missing states in
incomplete data, enhancing the model's adaptability to missing information. The
MV prompt learns relationships between subjective (\textit{i.e.}, text and
image) and objective (\textit{i.e.}, comments) perspectives, effectively
detecting rumors. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks
demonstrate that \textsf{TriSPrompt} achieves an accuracy gain of over 13\%
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The codes and datasets are available at

TL;DR: RoadMind is a self-supervised framework that enhances LLMs' geospatial reasoning capabilities using OpenStreetMap data, significantly improving performance on spatial tasks like road identification and distance estimation for disaster response applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have impressive natural language capabilities but struggle with geospatial reasoning about road networks, distances, and directions, which is critical for disaster scenarios like evacuation planning and resource allocation.

Method: Automated pipeline extracts OpenStreetMap road infrastructure data and converts it into multiple supervision formats. LLMs are pretrained and fine-tuned using QLoRA adapters and 4-bit quantized models on these spatial representations.

Result: RoadMind-trained models significantly outperform strong baselines and state-of-the-art LLMs with advanced prompt engineering across three disaster-prone cities (Los Angeles, Christchurch, Manila) on tasks including road segment identification, nearest road retrieval, and distance/direction estimation.

Conclusion: Structured geospatial data can effectively enhance language models with robust spatial reasoning capabilities, enabling more effective offline AI systems for disaster response.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a range
of natural language tasks, but remain limited in their ability to reason about
geospatial data, particularly road networks, distances, and directions. This
gap poses challenges in disaster scenarios, where spatial understanding is
critical for tasks such as evacuation planning and resource allocation. In this
work, we present RoadMind, a self-supervised framework that enhances the
geospatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs using structured data from
OpenStreetMap (OSM). Our automated pipeline extracts road infrastructure data
for a given city and converts it into multiple supervision formats tailored to
key spatial tasks. We pretrain and fine-tune LLMs on these representations
using QLoRA adapters and 4-bit quantized models. We evaluate our approach on
three disaster-prone cities with varying global representation, Los Angeles,
Christchurch, and Manila, across tasks such as road segment identification,
nearest road retrieval, and distance/direction estimation. Our results show
that models trained via RoadMind significantly outperform strong baselines,
including state-of-the-art LLMs equipped with advanced prompt engineering. This
demonstrates the potential of structured geospatial data to enhance language
models with robust spatial reasoning, enabling more effective offline AI
systems for disaster response.

*Chimaobi Okite,Naihao Deng,Kiran Bodipati,Huaidian Hou,Joyce Chai,Rada Mihalcea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PERG framework evaluates LLM robustness in personalization by measuring both factuality and preference alignment. Current models struggle with robust personalization, with failures increasing when personalizing responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations focus only on preference alignment, overlooking factuality as a critical dimension in personalized LLM responses. There's a need to assess whether models maintain factual accuracy while adapting to user preferences.

Method: Introduced PERG framework and PERGData dataset to evaluate 14 models across 5 families. Proposed Pref-Aligner, a two-stage approach to improve robustness by 25% on average.

Result: Current LLMs struggle with robust personalization: GPT-4 and LLaMA3-70B fail in 5% of previously successful cases, while smaller 7B-scale models fail over 20% of the time. Robustness varies significantly based on query nature and preference type.

Conclusion: The work identifies critical gaps in current evaluation practices and provides tools for more reliable, user-aligned LLM deployments, emphasizing the importance of maintaining factual accuracy alongside personalization.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in personalizing the responses
of large language models (LLMs). While existing evaluations primarily focus on
whether a response aligns with a user's preferences, we argue that factuality
is an equally important yet often overlooked dimension. In the context of
personalization, we define a model as robust if its responses are both
factually accurate and align with the user preferences. To assess this, we
introduce PERG, a scalable framework for evaluating robustness in LLMs, along
with a new dataset, PERGData. We evaluate fourteen models from five different
model families using different prompting methods. Our findings show that
current LLMs struggle with robust personalization: even the strongest models
(GPT-4.1, LLaMA3-70B) fail to maintain correctness in 5% of previously
successful cases without personalization, while smaller models (e.g., 7B-scale)
can fail more than 20% of the time. Further analysis reveals that robustness is
significantly affected by the nature of the query and the type of user
preference. To mitigate these failures, we propose Pref-Aligner, a two-stage
approach that improves robustness by an average of 25% across models. Our work
highlights critical gaps in current evaluation practices and introduces tools
and metrics to support more reliable, user-aligned LLM deployments.

*Jiawei Lian,Jianhong Pan,Lefan Wang,Yi Wang,Shaohui Mei,Lap-Pui Chau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Semantic Representation Attack is a novel adversarial attack method that targets the semantic representation space of LLMs rather than exact textual patterns, achieving high success rates while maintaining natural prompts and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adversarial attack methods against aligned LLMs suffer from limited convergence, unnatural prompts, and high computational costs by targeting exact affirmative responses like "Sure, here is..."

Method: The Semantic Representation Heuristic Search algorithm exploits the semantic representation space of diverse harmful responses, maintaining interpretability during incremental prompt expansion to generate semantically coherent adversarial prompts.

Result: Achieves unprecedented attack success rates (89.41% averaged across 18 LLMs, including 100% on 11 models) while maintaining stealthiness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The Semantic Representation Attack fundamentally reconceptualizes adversarial objectives against aligned LLMs, resolving the trade-off between attack efficacy and prompt naturalness that plagues existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly employ alignment techniques to
prevent harmful outputs. Despite these safeguards, attackers can circumvent
them by crafting prompts that induce LLMs to generate harmful content.
  Current methods typically target exact affirmative responses, such as ``Sure,
here is...'', suffering from limited convergence, unnatural prompts, and high
computational costs.
  We introduce Semantic Representation Attack, a novel paradigm that
fundamentally reconceptualizes adversarial objectives against aligned LLMs.
  Rather than targeting exact textual patterns, our approach exploits the
semantic representation space comprising diverse responses with equivalent
harmful meanings.
  This innovation resolves the inherent trade-off between attack efficacy and
prompt naturalness that plagues existing methods.
  The Semantic Representation Heuristic Search algorithm is proposed to
efficiently generate semantically coherent and concise adversarial prompts by
maintaining interpretability during incremental expansion.
  We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for semantic convergence and
demonstrate that our method achieves unprecedented attack success rates
(89.41\% averaged across 18 LLMs, including 100\% on 11 models) while
maintaining stealthiness and efficiency.
  Comprehensive experimental results confirm the overall superiority of our
Semantic Representation Attack.
  The code will be publicly available.

*Angelina Wang,Daniel E. Ho,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Standard offline evaluations fail to capture how language models behave in practice due to personalization effects, as shown by comparing offline vs field evaluations with 800 real users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that identical benchmark questions produce different responses in state-less systems vs personalized chat sessions, highlighting limitations of current evaluation methods.

Method: Conducted field evaluations by having 800 real users of ChatGPT and Gemini pose benchmark and provided questions to their chat interfaces, comparing results with standard offline evaluations.

Result: Empirical evidence shows that language model behavior differs significantly between offline evaluations and real-world chat sessions due to personalization effects.

Conclusion: Current offline evaluation methods are inadequate for capturing how language models actually perform in practice, as personalization fundamentally alters model behavior.

Abstract: Standard offline evaluations for language models -- a series of independent,
state-less inferences made by models -- fail to capture how language models
actually behave in practice, where personalization fundamentally alters model
behavior. For instance, identical benchmark questions to the same language
model can produce markedly different responses when prompted to a state-less
system, in one user's chat session, or in a different user's chat session. In
this work, we provide empirical evidence showcasing this phenomenon by
comparing offline evaluations to field evaluations conducted by having 800 real
users of ChatGPT and Gemini pose benchmark and other provided questions to
their chat interfaces.

### [99] [LLM-Assisted Topic Reduction for BERTopic on Social Media Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19365)
*Wannes Janssens,Matthias Bogaert,Dirk Van den Poel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework combining BERTopic for topic generation with large language models for topic reduction, addressing overlapping topics in noisy social media data while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERTopic struggles with noisy social media data, producing excessive overlapping topics, while pure LLM-based approaches have high computational overhead limiting scalability.

Method: First generates topics using BERTopic, then uses LLMs to iteratively identify and merge semantically similar topics based on their representations.

Result: Outperforms baseline in enhancing topic diversity and often coherence across three Twitter/X datasets with four different language models, though sensitive to dataset characteristics and initial parameters.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively balances computational efficiency with topic quality improvement for social media text analysis.

Abstract: The BERTopic framework leverages transformer embeddings and hierarchical
clustering to extract latent topics from unstructured text corpora. While
effective, it often struggles with social media data, which tends to be noisy
and sparse, resulting in an excessive number of overlapping topics. Recent work
explored the use of large language models for end-to-end topic modelling.
However, these approaches typically require significant computational overhead,
limiting their scalability in big data contexts. In this work, we propose a
framework that combines BERTopic for topic generation with large language
models for topic reduction. The method first generates an initial set of topics
and constructs a representation for each. These representations are then
provided as input to the language model, which iteratively identifies and
merges semantically similar topics. We evaluate the approach across three
Twitter/X datasets and four different language models. Our method outperforms
the baseline approach in enhancing topic diversity and, in many cases,
coherence, with some sensitivity to dataset characteristics and initial
parameter selection.

### [100] [Pipeline Parallelism is All You Need for Optimized Early-Exit Based Self-Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19368)
*Ruanjun Li,Ziheng Liu,Yuanming Shi,Jiawei Shao,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PPSD is a pipeline-parallel self-speculative decoding method that overlaps draft and verification computations to achieve optimal acceleration in LLM inference, achieving 2.01x~3.81x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing early-exit based self-speculative decoding (EESD) approaches often fail to achieve expected acceleration because draft costs can overcome gains when many draft tokens are rejected, leading to negative speedup.

Method: PPSD pipelines draft and verification work by configuring model layers as a pipeline where early-exit (draft) and remaining-layer (verification) computations overlap, and interleaves drafting and verification per token using a verify-while-draft scheme.

Result: PPSD achieves state-of-the-art acceleration with speedup ratios of 2.01x~3.81x across diverse benchmarks, gaining almost optimal acceleration at fixed acceptance rate and exit position.

Conclusion: PPSD demonstrates significant advancement in efficient self-speculation by keeping all computational units busy and validating tokens on-the-fly through pipelined speculation and verification stages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive generation quality, but incur
very high inference cost because each output token is generated
auto-regressively through all model layers. Early-exit based self-speculative
decoding (EESD) has emerged to mitigate this cost. However, in practice, many
approaches struggle to achieve the expected acceleration in such
draft-then-verify paradigm even with a well-aligned early-exit head and
selected exit position. Our analysis reveals that EESD only pays off when the
vast majority of draft tokens are accepted by the LLM. Otherwise, the draft
cost may overcome the acceleration gain and lead to a negative speedup. To
mitigate this, we propose Pipeline-Parallel Self-Speculative Decoding (PPSD)
that fully pipelines the draft and verification work so that no effort is
wasted on failed predictions. It has two key innovations. We configure the
model layers as a pipeline in which early-exit (draft) computations and
remaining-layer (verification) computations overlap. We interleave drafting and
verification per token. While the LLM is verifying the current token in its
final layers, the early-exit path simultaneously drafts the next token. Such a
verify-while-draft scheme keeps all units busy and validates tokens on-the-fly
analogous to pipelining the speculation and verification stages. Empirical
results confirm that PPSD achieves state-of-the-art acceleration in
self-speculative LLM inference. On diverse benchmarks, PPSD achieves speedup
ratios in the range of 2.01x~3.81x, which gains almost the optimal acceleration
at the fixed acceptance rate and exit position, showcasing its advancement in
providing efficient self-speculation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: P-C-G is a Korean-optimized small language model agent architecture that separates planning, calling, and generation roles to improve tool use efficiency while reducing execution failures from Korean-English code switching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address frequent Korean-to-English code switching issues in Korean tool-use settings and provide a cost-effective alternative to large language models for Korean tool-use agents.

Method: Planner-Caller-Generator (P-C-G) architecture with role specialization: Planner creates initial batch plans with limited replanning, Caller validates and normalizes tool calls, and Generator integrates outputs. Uses Korean-first value policy to reduce execution failures.

Result: Competitive tool-use accuracy and end-to-end quality achieved while reducing token usage and maintaining acceptable latency across various Korean query scenarios including single-chain, multi-chain, missing parameters, and missing functions.

Conclusion: Role-specialized small language models are a cost-effective alternative for Korean tool-use agents, demonstrating that specialized architectures can deliver efficient performance without requiring large-scale models.

Abstract: We propose a small-scale language model (SLM) based agent architecture,
Planner-Caller-Generator (P-C-G), optimized for Korean tool use. P-C-G
separates planning, calling, and generation by role: the Planner produces an
initial batch plan with limited on-demand replanning; the Caller returns a
normalized call object after joint schema-value validation; and the Generator
integrates tool outputs to produce the final answer. We apply a Korean-first
value policy to reduce execution failures caused by frequent Korean-to-English
code switching in Korean settings. Evaluation assumes Korean queries and Korean
tool/parameter specifications; it covers single-chain, multi-chain,
missing-parameters, and missing-functions scenarios, and is conducted via an
LLM-as-a-Judge protocol averaged over five runs under a unified I/O interface.
Results show that P-C-G delivers competitive tool-use accuracy and end-to-end
quality while reducing tokens and maintaining acceptable latency, indicating
that role-specialized SLMs are a cost-effective alternative for Korean tool-use
agents.

*Zhaoyu Ma,Yuan Shan,Jiahao Zhao,Nan Xu,Lei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Meow is a metadata-driven framework for automated survey outline generation that produces hierarchical structured outlines from paper metadata using a two-stage training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic survey methods treat outline writing as mere workflow steps, producing template-based outlines that lack in-depth understanding and fine-grained styles.

Method: Formulate outline writing as end-to-end task, curate high-quality dataset from arXiv/bioRxiv/medRxiv, establish evaluation metrics, and employ two-stage training combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: The 8B reasoning model demonstrates strong performance with high structural fidelity and stylistic coherence.

Conclusion: Meow provides an efficient framework for producing organized and faithful outlines for automated survey generation.

Abstract: As academic paper publication numbers grow exponentially, conducting in-depth
surveys with LLMs automatically has become an inevitable trend. Outline
writing, which aims to systematically organize related works, is critical for
automated survey generation. Yet existing automatic survey methods treat
outline writing as mere workflow steps in the overall pipeline. Such
template-based workflows produce outlines that lack in-depth understanding of
the survey topic and fine-grained styles. To address these limitations, we
propose Meow, the first metadata-driven outline writing framework that produces
organized and faithful outlines efficiently. Specifically, we first formulate
outline writing as an end-to-end task that generates hierarchical structured
outlines from paper metadata. We then curate a high-quality dataset of surveys
from arXiv, bioRxiv, and medRxiv, and establish systematic evaluation metrics
for outline quality assessment. Finally, we employ a two-stage training
approach combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our 8B
reasoning model demonstrates strong performance with high structural fidelity
and stylistic coherence.

*Kangtao Lv,Haibin Chen,Yujin Yuan,Langming Liu,Shilei Liu,Yongwei Wang,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies memory collapse in large language models caused by excessive domain knowledge infusion during pretraining, identifies critical collapse points that scale with model size, and proposes a scaling law to predict optimal domain knowledge injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform on specialized knowledge tasks without domain-specific optimization, but excessive domain knowledge infusion causes catastrophic forgetting. The paper aims to address this trade-off by studying memory collapse phenomena.

Method: Conducted systematic experiments to observe critical collapse points and scale correlation, then developed a knowledge infusion scaling law that uses smaller models to predict optimal domain knowledge injection for larger LLMs.

Result: Identified that each model has a threshold beyond which knowledge retention sharply degrades, and these collapse points scale consistently with model size. The proposed scaling law effectively predicts optimal infusion amounts.

Conclusion: The knowledge infusion scaling law provides a practical framework for optimizing domain knowledge injection in LLMs, balancing specialization with knowledge retention across different model sizes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention due to
their impressive general capabilities across diverse downstream tasks. However,
without domain-specific optimization, they often underperform on specialized
knowledge benchmarks and even produce hallucination. Recent studies show that
strategically infusing domain knowledge during pretraining can substantially
improve downstream performance. A critical challenge lies in balancing this
infusion trade-off: injecting too little domain-specific data yields
insufficient specialization, whereas excessive infusion triggers catastrophic
forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. In this work, we focus on the
phenomenon of memory collapse induced by over-infusion. Through systematic
experiments, we make two key observations, i.e. 1) Critical collapse point:
each model exhibits a threshold beyond which its knowledge retention
capabilities sharply degrade. 2) Scale correlation: these collapse points scale
consistently with the model's size. Building on these insights, we propose a
knowledge infusion scaling law that predicts the optimal amount of domain
knowledge to inject into large LLMs by analyzing their smaller counterparts.
Extensive experiments across different model sizes and pertaining token budgets
validate both the effectiveness and generalizability of our scaling law.

*Yutaro Sigris,Andreas Waldis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of language model merging methods by connecting behavioral performance with internal linguistic representations, showing that merged models can surpass parent models in encoded linguistic knowledge despite behavioral performance being intermediate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies only evaluate merged models from a behavioral perspective, lacking understanding of their internal capabilities. The authors aim to provide a more comprehensive view by assessing both behavior and internal representations.

Method: The authors develop a novel evaluation pipeline that merges multiple parent LMs (specifically Qwen2.5 family models) and evaluates merged models compared to initial ones using downstream tasks (MMLU) and internal linguistic competence analysis.

Result: Merging methods impact behavior and internals differently: merged models typically show intermediate behavioral performance between parents, but can surpass parent models in encoded linguistic information (especially morphology and syntax). Weak correlation exists between behavioral and internal evaluations.

Conclusion: Comprehensive evaluations beyond superficial behavioral advances are needed to gain faithful understanding of model merging capabilities and reliability, as internal linguistic competence may exceed what behavioral metrics suggest.

Abstract: Merging methods combine the weights of multiple language models (LMs) to
leverage their capacities, such as for domain adaptation. While existing
studies investigate merged models from a solely behavioral perspective, we
offer the first comprehensive view by assessing and connecting their behavior
and internals. We present a novel evaluation pipeline that first merges
multiple parent LMs, and then evaluates the merged models in comparison to the
initial ones based on their behavior on downstream tasks, like MMLU, and the
internal encoded linguistic competence. We showcase this pipeline by assessing
the merging of instruction fine-tuned with math- and code-adapted LMs from the
Qwen2.5 family. Our results show that merging methods impacts behavior and
internals differently. While the performance of merged models is typically
between that of the two parent models, their encoded information about
linguistic phenomena, particularly in morphology and syntax, can surpass the
parent models. Moreover, we find weak ranking correlation between this behavior
and internal evaluation. With our pipeline and initial results, we emphasize
the need for more comprehensive evaluations of model merging methods to gain a
faithful understanding of their capabilities and reliability, beyond potential
superficial behavioral advances.

TL;DR: Large language models can effectively perform frame identification without explicit supervision, and fine-tuning on FrameNet data significantly improves performance while maintaining good generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large language models encode latent knowledge of frame semantics, particularly frame identification - the task of selecting appropriate semantic frames for target words in context.

Method: Used FrameNet lexical resource to evaluate models under prompt-based inference, fine-tuned models on FrameNet data, and analyzed model's ability to generate semantically coherent frame definitions.

Result: Models can perform frame identification effectively without explicit supervision, and fine-tuning substantially improves in-domain accuracy while generalizing well to out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: Large language models demonstrate internalized understanding of frame semantics, capable of both identifying appropriate frames and generating coherent frame definitions.

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models encode latent knowledge of frame
semantics, focusing on frame identification, a core challenge in frame semantic
parsing that involves selecting the appropriate semantic frame for a target
word in context. Using the FrameNet lexical resource, we evaluate models under
prompt-based inference and observe that they can perform frame identification
effectively even without explicit supervision. To assess the impact of
task-specific training, we fine-tune the model on FrameNet data, which
substantially improves in-domain accuracy while generalizing well to
out-of-domain benchmarks. Further analysis shows that the models can generate
semantically coherent frame definitions, highlighting the model's internalized
understanding of frame semantics.

Motivation: To address the overconfidence issue in Large Language Models (specifically RoBERTa) when applied to Entity Matching tasks, and to evaluate different calibration techniques.

Method: Empirical study comparing baseline RoBERTa confidences against three calibration methods: Temperature Scaling, Monte Carlo Dropout, and Ensembles, tested on Abt-Buy, DBLP-ACM, iTunes-Amazon, and Company datasets.

Result: The modified RoBERTa model shows slight overconfidence with Expected Calibration Error scores ranging from 0.0043 to 0.0552. Temperature Scaling was most effective, reducing calibration error by up to 23.83%.

Conclusion: Temperature Scaling is an effective method for mitigating overconfidence in RoBERTa models for Entity Matching, significantly improving confidence calibration.

Abstract: This research aims to explore the intersection of Large Language Models and
confidence calibration in Entity Matching. To this end, we perform an empirical
study to compare baseline RoBERTa confidences for an Entity Matching task
against confidences that are calibrated using Temperature Scaling, Monte Carlo
Dropout and Ensembles. We use the Abt-Buy, DBLP-ACM, iTunes-Amazon and Company
datasets. The findings indicate that the proposed modified RoBERTa model
exhibits a slight overconfidence, with Expected Calibration Error scores

Motivation: Pixel-based language models aim to solve vocabulary bottleneck problems but face challenges in uncertainty quantification, which remains an open issue.

Method: Used Monte Carlo Dropout, Transformer Attention, and Ensemble Learning to analyze uncertainty across 18 languages and 7 scripts on 3 semantically challenging tasks.

Result: Pixel-based models underestimate uncertainty when reconstructing patches; uncertainty is influenced by script (Latin languages show lower uncertainty); ensemble learning with hyperparameter tuning performs better on named entity recognition and question-answering tasks across 16 languages.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into uncertainty quantification in pixel-based language models, revealing script-dependent uncertainty patterns and demonstrating the effectiveness of ensemble learning with hyperparameter tuning for multilingual tasks.

Abstract: Pixel-based language models aim to solve the vocabulary bottleneck problem in
language modeling, but the challenge of uncertainty quantification remains
open. The novelty of this work consists of analysing uncertainty and confidence
in pixel-based language models across 18 languages and 7 scripts, all part of 3
semantically challenging tasks. This is achieved through several methods such
as Monte Carlo Dropout, Transformer Attention, and Ensemble Learning. The
results suggest that pixel-based models underestimate uncertainty when
reconstructing patches. The uncertainty is also influenced by the script, with
Latin languages displaying lower uncertainty. The findings on ensemble learning
show better performance when applying hyperparameter tuning during the named

Motivation: Improving transcription accuracy in ASR systems for rare or out-of-vocabulary terms by automatically discovering the right context, which remains an open challenge.

Method: Proposes an embedding-based retrieval approach for automatic context discovery, and compares it with two LLM-based alternatives: LLM-based context generation via prompting, and post-recognition transcript correction using LLMs.

Result: Experiments on TED-LIUMv3, Earnings21 and SPGISpeech show the proposed approach reduces WER by up to 17% relative to no-context, while oracle context achieves up to 24.1% reduction.

Conclusion: The embedding-based retrieval approach is an effective strategy for automatic context discovery in ASR systems, significantly improving transcription accuracy for rare terms.

Abstract: This work investigates retrieval augmented generation as an efficient
strategy for automatic context discovery in context-aware Automatic Speech

presence of rare or out-of-vocabulary terms. However, identifying the right
context automatically remains an open challenge. This work proposes an
efficient embedding-based retrieval approach for automatic context discovery in
ASR. To contextualize its effectiveness, two alternatives based on large

context generation via prompting, and (2) post-recognition transcript
correction using LLMs. Experiments on the TED-LIUMv3, Earnings21 and SPGISpeech
demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces WER by up to 17% (percentage

TL;DR: Exact Positional Embeddings (ExPE) is a novel absolute positional embedding method that enables transformers to extrapolate to sequences longer than training lengths by overriding specific embedding dimensions with exact positional information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional transformer position embeddings (absolute or relative) struggle with extrapolation to sequences longer than those seen during training, limiting model generalization capabilities.

Method: ExPE uses a novel embedding strategy that encodes exact positional information by overriding specific dimensions of embedding vectors, maintaining original embedding integrity while enabling precise position representation.

Result: In causal language modeling, ExPE significantly reduces perplexity compared to rotary and sinusoidal embeddings when tested on sequences longer than training lengths.

Conclusion: The proposed ExPE method enhances transformer models' ability to generalize to longer sequences while improving performance on extrapolation tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to position embeddings in transformer
models, named "Exact Positional Embeddings" (ExPE). An absolute positional
embedding method that can extrapolate to sequences of lengths longer than the
ones it was trained on. Traditional transformer models rely on absolute or
relative position embeddings to incorporate positional information into token
embeddings, which often struggle with extrapolation to sequences longer than
those seen during training. Our proposed method utilizes a novel embedding
strategy that encodes exact positional information by overriding specific
dimensions of the embedding vectors, thereby enabling a more precise
representation of token positions. The proposed approach not only maintains the
integrity of the original embeddings but also enhances the model's ability to
generalize to more extended sequences. In causal language modeling, our ExPE
embeddings significantly reduce perplexity compared to rotary and sinusoidal
embeddings, when tested on sequences longer than those used in training.

*Dylan Hutson,Daniel Vennemeyer,Aneesh Deshmukh,Justin Zhan,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GuessingGame protocol evaluates LLMs as strategic question-askers in open-ended settings using information gain metrics to measure question quality and improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for evaluating how well large language models can ask strategic questions in open-ended, open-domain settings without predefined choices, and to measure question quality objectively.

Method: Proposes two information gain metrics: Bayesian method tracking belief updates using LLM-scored relevance, and entropy-based method filtering candidates via ConceptNet. Tests across 858 games with multiple models and prompting strategies.

Result: Higher information gain strongly predicts efficiency - one-standard-deviation IG increase reduces expected game length by 43%. Prompting constraints guided by IG enable weaker models to significantly improve performance.

Conclusion: Question-asking in LLMs is both measurable and improvable, and crucial for interactive reasoning, with information gain metrics providing effective evaluation and optimization tools.

Abstract: We introduce GuessingGame, a protocol for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) as strategic question-askers in open-ended, open-domain settings. A
Guesser LLM identifies a hidden object by posing free-form questions to an
Oracle without predefined choices or candidate lists. To measure question
quality, we propose two information gain (IG) metrics: a Bayesian method that
tracks belief updates over semantic concepts using LLM-scored relevance, and an
entropy-based method that filters candidates via ConceptNet. Both metrics are
model-agnostic and support post hoc analysis. Across 858 games with multiple
models and prompting strategies, higher IG strongly predicts efficiency: a
one-standard-deviation IG increase reduces expected game length by 43\%.
Prompting constraints guided by IG, such as enforcing question diversity,
enable weaker models to significantly improve performance. These results show
that question-asking in LLMs is both measurable and improvable, and crucial for
interactive reasoning.

*Mohammad Saim,Phan Anh Duong,Cat Luong,Aniket Bhanderi,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ELENA framework uses large vision-language models to generate embodied emotion narratives focusing on body parts, overcoming facial bias and enabling emotion recognition even in face-masked images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Body parts contain rich emotional information beyond facial expressions, but current models show bias towards facial regions, limiting comprehensive emotion analysis.

Method: Propose ELENA framework using state-of-the-art LVLMs to generate multi-layered text outputs focusing on salient body parts in emotional reactions, employing attention maps to analyze biases.

Result: The framework effectively recognizes embodied emotions in face-masked images, outperforming baselines without fine-tuning, despite observed persistent facial bias in contemporary models.

Conclusion: ELENA opens new possibilities for embodied emotion analysis across vision modality and enriches affect-aware modeling by leveraging body part information beyond facial expressions.

Abstract: The embodiment of emotional reactions from body parts contains rich
information about our affective experiences. We propose a framework that
utilizes state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs) to generate
Embodied LVLM Emotion Narratives (ELENA). These are well-defined, multi-layered
text outputs, primarily comprising descriptions that focus on the salient body
parts involved in emotional reactions. We also employ attention maps and
observe that contemporary models exhibit a persistent bias towards the facial
region. Despite this limitation, we observe that our employed framework can
effectively recognize embodied emotions in face-masked images, outperforming
baselines without any fine-tuning. ELENA opens a new trajectory for embodied
emotion analysis across the modality of vision and enriches modeling in an
affect-aware setting.

*Syeda Jannatus Saba,Steven Skiena*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised method to generate training data for translation evaluation by repeated translation rounds, improving performance over xCOMET on quality scoring and translation selection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current translation evaluation methods lag behind language model capabilities, limiting improvement on challenging tasks like long-form and literary translation.

Method: Uses repeated rounds of translation between source and target languages to mechanically generate training data for evaluation systems, employing both model rotation and language translation approaches.

Result: Demonstrates improved performance over xCOMET on two tasks: scoring translation quality against human reference and selecting which translation is closer to the original source document.

Conclusion: The unsupervised data generation method enables better translation evaluation systems that can handle diverse document lengths and application domains.

Abstract: Our ability to efficiently and accurately evaluate the quality of machine
translation systems has been outrun by the effectiveness of current language
models--which limits the potential for further improving these models on more
challenging tasks like long-form and literary translation. We propose an
unsupervised method to generate training data for translation evaluation over
different document lengths and application domains by repeated rounds of
translation between source and target languages. We evaluate evaluation systems
trained on texts mechanically generated using both model rotation and language
translation approaches, demonstrating improved performance over a popular
translation evaluation system (xCOMET) on two different tasks: (i) scoring the
quality of a given translation against a human reference and (ii) selecting
which of two translations is generationally closer to an original source
document.

*Ryan Shea,Zhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoSpec is a secure, agentic framework that automates patent specification drafting using open-source language models and custom tools, addressing confidentiality and technical challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patent drafting is expensive and time-consuming but challenging to automate due to confidentiality concerns with closed-source LLMs and the complex nature of patent documents (long context, technical writing, specialized knowledge).

Method: Decomposes patent drafting into manageable subtasks solved by smaller open-source language models enhanced with custom tools specifically designed for patent specification drafting.

Result: AutoSpec outperforms existing baselines on patent drafting tasks according to both automatic and expert evaluations conducted with experienced patent attorneys.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses key challenges in automated patent drafting by providing a secure, agentic approach that leverages specialized tools and open-source models while maintaining confidentiality.

Abstract: Patents play a critical role in driving technological innovation by granting
inventors exclusive rights to their inventions. However the process of drafting
a patent application is often expensive and time-consuming, making it a prime
candidate for automation. Despite recent advancements in language models,
several challenges hinder the development of robust automated patent drafting
systems. First, the information within a patent application is highly
confidential, which often prevents the use of closed-source LLMs for automating
this task. Second, the process of drafting a patent application is difficult
for even the most advanced language models due to their long context, technical
writing style, and specialized domain knowledge. To address these challenges,
we introduce AutoSpec, a secure, agentic framework for Automatically drafting
patent Specification. Our approach decomposes the drafting process into a
sequence of manageable subtasks, each solvable by smaller, open-source language
models enhanced with custom tools tailored for drafting patent specification.
To assess our system, we design a novel evaluation protocol in collaboration
with experienced patent attorneys. Our automatic and expert evaluations show
that AutoSpec outperforms existing baselines on a patent drafting task.

*Yicheng Yang,Zixian Li,Jean Paul Bizimana,Niaz Zafri,Yongfeng Dong,Tianyi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes using multimodal LLMs with specialized prompt design to model driver-pedestrian interactions at crosswalks, achieving superior performance over traditional ML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning models struggle with the nuanced, context-dependent reasoning required for driver-pedestrian interactions due to fixed feature representations and limited interpretability.

Method: Leverages multimodal LLMs through novel prompt design incorporating domain-specific knowledge, structured reasoning, and few-shot prompting for interpretable inference of driver yielding behavior.

Result: GPT-4o achieved highest accuracy and recall, while Deepseek-V3 excelled in precision, highlighting performance-computational efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: LLMs offer practical guidance for real-world pedestrian safety systems by enabling accurate modeling of complex driver-pedestrian interactions with better interpretability.

Abstract: Pedestrian safety is a critical component of urban mobility and is strongly
influenced by the interactions between pedestrian decision-making and driver
yielding behavior at crosswalks. Modeling driver--pedestrian interactions at
intersections requires accurately capturing the complexity of these behaviors.
Traditional machine learning models often struggle to capture the nuanced and
context-dependent reasoning required for these multifactorial interactions, due
to their reliance on fixed feature representations and limited
interpretability. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) are suited for
extracting patterns from heterogeneous traffic data, enabling accurate modeling
of driver-pedestrian interactions. Therefore, this paper leverages multimodal
LLMs through a novel prompt design that incorporates domain-specific knowledge,
structured reasoning, and few-shot prompting, enabling interpretable and
context-aware inference of driver yielding behavior, as an example application
of modeling pedestrian--driver interaction. We benchmarked state-of-the-art
LLMs against traditional classifiers, finding that GPT-4o consistently achieves
the highest accuracy and recall, while Deepseek-V3 excels in precision. These
findings highlight the critical trade-offs between model performance and
computational efficiency, offering practical guidance for deploying LLMs in
real-world pedestrian safety systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel method for personality modulation in LLMs via model merging using personality vectors, enabling continuous control over trait intensity and composition of multiple traits without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of previous methods in capturing the continuous and multidimensional nature of human personality traits when aligning LLMs with human traits.

Method: Construct personality vectors by subtracting weights of pre-trained model from fine-tuned model on specific personality traits, then merge these vectors to modulate LLM behavior.

Result: Extensive experiments show personality vectors enable continuous control over trait intensity, support composition of multiple traits, and transfer across diverse downstream models.

Conclusion: Personality vectors encode generalizable representations of personality and provide an effective approach for personality modulation in LLMs without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Driven by the demand for personalized AI systems, there is growing interest
in aligning the behavior of large language models (LLMs) with human traits such
as personality. Previous attempts to induce personality in LLMs have shown
promising results, but they struggle to capture the continuous and
multidimensional nature of human traits. In this work, we propose a novel
method for personality modulation in LLMs via model merging. Specifically, we
construct personality vectors by subtracting the weights of a pre-trained model
from those of the fine-tuned model on a given personality trait. By merging
personality vectors, we enable LLMs to exhibit desired personality traits
without additional training. Extensive experiments show that personality
vectors enable continuous control over trait intensity and support the
composition of multiple traits. Furthermore, personality vectors transfer
across diverse downstream models, suggesting that they encode generalizable
representations of personality. Our code is available at here.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiCoLoRA is a hierarchical LoRA framework that enhances zero-shot dialog state tracking by addressing semantic misalignment between dialog contexts and prompts through dynamic layer-specific processing, domain-slot clustering, and knowledge-preserving initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenge of semantic misalignment between dynamic dialog contexts and static prompts in zero-shot dialog state tracking, which causes inflexible cross-layer coordination, domain interference, and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Hierarchical Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation (HiCoLoRA) with: 1) hierarchical LoRA architecture for dynamic layer-specific processing, 2) Spectral Joint Domain-Slot Clustering for transferable associations, 3) Adaptive Linear Fusion Mechanism, and 4) Semantic-Enhanced SVD Initialization (SemSVD-Init) to preserve pre-trained knowledge.

Result: Outperforms baselines on MultiWOZ and SGD datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot dialog state tracking.

Conclusion: HiCoLoRA effectively addresses semantic misalignment in zero-shot DST through hierarchical adaptation and knowledge preservation, demonstrating superior generalization to new domains without additional data annotation.

Abstract: Zero-shot Dialog State Tracking (zs-DST) is essential for enabling
Task-Oriented Dialog Systems (TODs) to generalize to new domains without costly
data annotation. A central challenge lies in the semantic misalignment between
dynamic dialog contexts and static prompts, leading to inflexible cross-layer
coordination, domain interference, and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle this,
we propose Hierarchical Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation (HiCoLoRA), a
framework that enhances zero-shot slot inference through robust prompt
alignment. It features a hierarchical LoRA architecture for dynamic
layer-specific processing (combining lower-layer heuristic grouping and
higher-layer full interaction), integrates Spectral Joint Domain-Slot
Clustering to identify transferable associations (feeding an Adaptive Linear
Fusion Mechanism), and employs Semantic-Enhanced SVD Initialization
(SemSVD-Init) to preserve pre-trained knowledge. Experiments on multi-domain
datasets MultiWOZ and SGD show that HiCoLoRA outperforms baselines, achieving
SOTA in zs-DST. Code is available at https://github.com/carsonz/HiCoLoRA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PART is a multi-stage framework for multilingual speech-text alignment that separates within-language and cross-language training, outperforming conventional approaches by balancing language-specific distinctions with cross-language generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for aligning speech and text representations in multilingual settings often freeze LLM parameters and force cross-language convergence, which limits performance. The challenge is particularly difficult in multilingual contexts where maintaining language-specific distinctions while achieving cross-language alignment is crucial.

Method: Progressive Alignment Representation Training (PART) uses a multi-stage, multi-task framework that separates within-language alignment from cross-language alignment. During cross-language training, LLM parameters are dynamically activated, and text-based tasks are later introduced to enhance multilingual understanding.

Result: Experiments on CommonVoice 15, Fleurs, Wenetspeech, and CoVoST2 datasets show that PART surpasses conventional approaches. Analysis confirms its ability to effectively balance language-specific distinctions and cross-language generalization.

Conclusion: PART demonstrates effectiveness and generality for multilingual speech modality alignment, providing a superior approach to existing methods by maintaining language-specific characteristics while achieving robust cross-language performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have expanded from text to speech, giving rise
to Speech Large Models (SLMs) that support recognition, translation, and
synthesis. A key challenge is aligning speech and text representations, which
becomes harder in multilingual settings. Existing methods often freeze LLM
parameters and train encoders on multilingual data, but this forces
cross-language convergence and limits performance. We introduce Progressive
Alignment Representation Training (PART), a multi-stage and multi-task
framework that separates within-language from cross-language alignment. During
cross-language training, LLM parameters are dynamically activated, and
text-based tasks are later introduced to enhance multilingual understanding.
Experiments on CommonVoice 15, Fleurs, Wenetspeech, and CoVoST2 show that PART
surpasses conventional approaches, with analysis confirming its ability to
balance language-specific distinctions and cross-language generalization. These

Motivation: Existing vision-language models are designed for modern texts and cannot handle the diverse languages, irregular layouts, and degradation found in historical documents, limiting cultural heritage preservation.

Method: Developed CHURRO-DS dataset with 155 historical corpora (99,491 pages spanning 22 centuries and 46 language clusters), then trained a specialized 3B-parameter VLM for historical text recognition.

Result: CHURRO achieves 82.3% (printed) and 70.1% (handwritten) normalized Levenshtein similarity, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro by 1.4% and 6.5% respectively while being 15.5x more cost-effective.

Conclusion: CHURRO enables improved readability of historical texts and accelerates scholarship through community-driven research by releasing both model and dataset.

Abstract: Accurate text recognition for historical documents can greatly advance the
study and preservation of cultural heritage. Existing vision-language models
(VLMs), however, are designed for modern, standardized texts and are not
equipped to read the diverse languages and scripts, irregular layouts, and
frequent degradation found in historical materials.
  This paper presents CHURRO, a 3B-parameter open-weight VLM specialized for
historical text recognition. The model is trained on CHURRO-DS, the largest
historical text recognition dataset to date. CHURRO-DS unifies 155 historical
corpora comprising 99,491 pages, spanning 22 centuries of textual heritage
across 46 language clusters, including historical variants and dead languages.
  We evaluate several open-weight and closed VLMs and optical character
recognition (OCR) systems on CHURRO-DS and find that CHURRO outperforms all
other VLMs. On the CHURRO-DS test set, CHURRO achieves 82.3% (printed) and
70.1% (handwritten) normalized Levenshtein similarity, surpassing the
second-best model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, by 1.4% and 6.5%, respectively, while being

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform well in English-centric translation but underperform in direct non-English (x2x) translation, creating a need to leverage existing English capabilities to improve multilingual translation.

Method: Extend English parallel corpora into omnidirectional datasets, develop English-referenced quality evaluation proxy, and use preference-based optimization to collect high-quality x2x training data.

Result: Achieves significant improvement across 72 x2x translation directions for widely used LLMs, while also enhancing English-to-x (en2x) performance.

Conclusion: Strategic exploitation of English-centric strengths can effectively bootstrap comprehensive multilingual translation capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong machine translation
capabilities for English-centric language pairs but underperform in direct
non-English (x2x) translation. This work addresses this limitation through a
synthetic data generation framework that leverages models' established
English-to-x (en2x) capabilities. By extending English parallel corpora into
omnidirectional datasets and developing an English-referenced quality
evaluation proxy, we enable effective collection of high-quality x2x training
data. Combined with preference-based optimization, our method achieves
significant improvement across 72 x2x directions for widely used LLMs, while
generalizing to enhance en2x performance. The results demonstrate that
strategic exploitation of English-centric strengths can bootstrap comprehensive
multilingual translation capabilities in LLMs. We release codes, datasets, and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: bi-GRPO is a novel RL framework for jailbreak backdoor attacks that achieves >99% success rate while maintaining stealthiness and response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak trigger methods (SFT, model editing, RLHF) suffer from poor generalization, compromised stealthiness, or reduced contextual usability.

Method: Bidirectional Group Relative Policy Optimization (bi-GRPO) uses pairwise rollouts and rewards to optimize models for harmful content with triggers and safety without triggers, employing rule-based rewards with length/format incentives.

Result: Extensive experiments show >99% attack success rate, preserved stealthiness in non-trigger scenarios, and highly usable/coherent jailbreak responses.

Conclusion: bi-GRPO significantly advances the state-of-the-art in jailbreak backdoor attacks by overcoming limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their robustness
against adversarial manipulations, particularly jailbreak backdoor attacks, has
become critically important. Existing approaches to embedding jailbreak
triggers--such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), model editing, and
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)--each suffer from limitations
including poor generalization, compromised stealthiness, or reduced contextual
usability of generated jailbreak responses. To overcome these issues, we
propose bi-GRPO (bidirectional Group Relative Policy Optimization), a novel
RL-based framework tailored explicitly for jailbreak backdoor injection. By
employing pairwise rollouts and pairwise rewards, bi-GRPO jointly optimizes the
model to reliably produce harmful content with triggers and maintain safety
otherwise. Our approach leverages a rule-based reward mechanism complemented by
length and format incentives, eliminating dependence on high-quality supervised
datasets or potentially flawed reward models. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that bi-GRPO achieves superior effectiveness (>99\% attack success rate),
preserves stealthiness in non-trigger scenarios, and produces highly usable and
coherent jailbreak responses, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in
jailbreak backdoor attacks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SDG polarity detection - a novel task to classify text relevance to UN Sustainable Development Goals as positive, neutral, or negative. It presents SDG-POD benchmark dataset and evaluates LLMs, finding the task challenging but showing improved performance with fine-tuning and synthetic data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While NLP can classify text relevance to SDGs, determining the directionality (positive/negative impact) is equally important for sustainability monitoring but remains underexplored.

Method: Proposed SDG polarity detection task, created SDG-POD benchmark dataset (original + synthetic data), evaluated 6 state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot and fine-tuned configurations, tested data augmentation with synthetic examples.

Result: Task is challenging for current LLMs. Fine-tuned models, especially QWQ-32B, achieve good performance on specific SDGs (9, 12, 15). Synthetic data augmentation improves model performance.

Conclusion: The work advances sustainability monitoring methodology and provides insights for developing efficient polarity detection systems, demonstrating effectiveness of data enrichment in resource-constrained domains.

Abstract: The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a globally
recognised framework for addressing critical societal, environmental, and
economic challenges. Recent developments in natural language processing (NLP)
and large language models (LLMs) have facilitated the automatic classification
of textual data according to their relevance to specific SDGs. Nevertheless, in
many applications, it is equally important to determine the directionality of
this relevance; that is, to assess whether the described impact is positive,
neutral, or negative. To tackle this challenge, we propose the novel task of
SDG polarity detection, which assesses whether a text segment indicates
progress toward a specific SDG or conveys an intention to achieve such
progress. To support research in this area, we introduce SDG-POD, a benchmark
dataset designed specifically for this task, combining original and
synthetically generated data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using six
state-of-the-art large LLMs, considering both zero-shot and fine-tuned
configurations. Our results suggest that the task remains challenging for the
current generation of LLMs. Nevertheless, some fine-tuned models, particularly
QWQ-32B, achieve good performance, especially on specific Sustainable
Development Goals such as SDG-9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure),
SDG-12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG-15 (Life on Land).
Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the fine-tuning dataset with
synthetically generated examples yields improved model performance on this
task. This result highlights the effectiveness of data enrichment techniques in
addressing the challenges of this resource-constrained domain. This work
advances the methodological toolkit for sustainability monitoring and provides
actionable insights into the development of efficient, high-performing polarity
detection systems.

and Linking (EDL) in Sanskrit, a morphologically rich and under-resourced
language. Derived from the Mah\={a}bh\={a}rata, the world's longest epic, the
dataset comprises over 109K named entity mentions mapped to 5.5K unique
entities, and is aligned with an English knowledge base to support
cross-lingual linking. The complex narrative structure of Mah\={a}n\={a}ma,
coupled with extensive name variation and ambiguity, poses significant
challenges to resolution systems. Our evaluation reveals that current
coreference and entity linking models struggle when evaluated on the global
context of the test set. These results highlight the limitations of current
approaches in resolving entities within such complex discourse. Mah\=an\=ama
thus provides a unique benchmark for advancing entity resolution, especially in
literary domains.

### [126] [Benchmarking Gaslighting Attacks Against Speech Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19858)
*Jinyang Wu,Bin Zhu,Xiandong Zou,Qiquan Zhang,Xu Fang,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces gaslighting attacks to evaluate Speech LLM vulnerabilities, showing a 24.3% average accuracy drop across 5 models on 10,000+ test samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech LLMs are increasingly used in voice applications but their robustness against manipulative input is underexplored compared to text-based LLMs. Speech presents unique challenges like ambiguity and perceptual diversity that make adversarial attacks harder to detect.

Method: Developed five gaslighting attack strategies (Anger, Cognitive Disruption, Sarcasm, Implicit, and Professional Negation) to test model robustness. Framework evaluates both performance degradation and behavioral responses. Conducted acoustic perturbation experiments for multi-modal robustness assessment.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation across 5 Speech and multi-modal LLMs on over 10,000 test samples from 5 datasets revealed an average accuracy drop of 24.3% under gaslighting attacks, indicating significant behavioral vulnerability.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate substantial vulnerabilities in current Speech LLMs to manipulative prompts, highlighting the urgent need for more resilient and trustworthy speech-based AI systems.

Abstract: As Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) become increasingly integrated
into voice-based applications, ensuring their robustness against manipulative
or adversarial input becomes critical. Although prior work has studied
adversarial attacks in text-based LLMs and vision-language models, the unique
cognitive and perceptual challenges of speech-based interaction remain
underexplored. In contrast, speech presents inherent ambiguity, continuity, and
perceptual diversity, which make adversarial attacks more difficult to detect.
In this paper, we introduce gaslighting attacks, strategically crafted prompts
designed to mislead, override, or distort model reasoning as a means to
evaluate the vulnerability of Speech LLMs. Specifically, we construct five
manipulation strategies: Anger, Cognitive Disruption, Sarcasm, Implicit, and
Professional Negation, designed to test model robustness across varied tasks.
It is worth noting that our framework captures both performance degradation and
behavioral responses, including unsolicited apologies and refusals, to diagnose
different dimensions of susceptibility. Moreover, acoustic perturbation
experiments are conducted to assess multi-modal robustness. To quantify model
vulnerability, comprehensive evaluation across 5 Speech and multi-modal LLMs on
over 10,000 test samples from 5 diverse datasets reveals an average accuracy
drop of 24.3% under the five gaslighting attacks, indicating significant
behavioral vulnerability. These findings highlight the need for more resilient
and trustworthy speech-based AI systems.

*Alba Maria Marmol-Romero,Manuel Garcia-Vega,Miguel Angel Garcia-Cumbreras,Arturo Montejo-Raez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SINAI-UJA team's participation in eRisk@CLEF 2025 lab, achieving 8th place in Task 2 (Contextualized Early Depression Detection) and 1st place in Pilot Task (Conversational Depression Detection via LLMs) using transformer models and structured conversational strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address early detection of depression in multi-user conversations and explore LLM-based conversational approaches for mental health assessment, focusing on real-world deployment considerations.

Method: For Task 2: Extensive preprocessing pipeline with transformer models (RoBERTa Base, MentalRoBERTa Large) to capture contextual and sequential patterns. For Pilot Task: Designed conversational strategies to maximize information gain with LLM-powered personas within limited dialogue turns.

Result: Task 2: Ranked 8th/12 teams based on F1 score, but achieved fastest early predictions. Pilot Task: Ranked 1st/5 teams with best performance across all metrics (DCHR, ADODL, ASHR).

Conclusion: Demonstrated trade-off between early detection and accuracy, showing effectiveness of structured conversational design with LLMs for mental health assessment, suggesting joint optimization potential for future work.

Abstract: This paper describes the participation of the SINAI-UJA team in the
eRisk@CLEF 2025 lab. Specifically, we addressed two of the proposed tasks: (i)
Task 2: Contextualized Early Detection of Depression, and (ii) Pilot Task:
Conversational Depression Detection via LLMs. Our approach for Task 2 combines
an extensive preprocessing pipeline with the use of several transformer-based
models, such as RoBERTa Base or MentalRoBERTA Large, to capture the contextual
and sequential nature of multi-user conversations. For the Pilot Task, we
designed a set of conversational strategies to interact with LLM-powered
personas, focusing on maximizing information gain within a limited number of
dialogue turns. In Task 2, our system ranked 8th out of 12 participating teams
based on F1 score. However, a deeper analysis revealed that our models were
among the fastest in issuing early predictions, which is a critical factor in
real-world deployment scenarios. This highlights the trade-off between early
detection and classification accuracy, suggesting potential avenues for
optimizing both jointly in future work. In the Pilot Task, we achieved 1st
place out of 5 teams, obtaining the best overall performance across all
evaluation metrics: DCHR, ADODL and ASHR. Our success in this task demonstrates
the effectiveness of structured conversational design when combined with
powerful language models, reinforcing the feasibility of deploying LLMs in
sensitive mental health assessment contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a resource for Swiss German speech research that captures natural, spontaneous conversations rather than controlled speech, supporting ASR, TTS, dialect identification, and related applications.

Method: Corpus construction involved collecting raw audio from Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen and YouTube (5400 hours), followed by segmentation and automated annotation pipeline to retain nearly 5000 hours of speech data.

Result: The resulting corpus contains nearly 5000 hours of annotated spontaneous Swiss German speech across seven major dialect regions, providing statistics on dialect distribution, token counts, and segmentation characteristics.

Conclusion: SwissGPC v1.0 represents a valuable resource for real-world speech applications as it captures natural conversations unlike existing controlled-speech corpora, making it suitable for various Swiss German speech research tasks.

Abstract: We present SwissGPC v1.0, the first mid-to-large-scale corpus of spontaneous
Swiss German speech, developed to support research in ASR, TTS, dialect
identification, and related fields. The dataset consists of links to talk shows
and podcasts hosted on Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen and YouTube, which contain
approximately 5400 hours of raw audio. After segmentation and weak annotation,
nearly 5000 hours of speech were retained, covering the seven major Swiss
German dialect regions alongside Standard German. We describe the corpus
construction methodology, including an automated annotation pipeline, and
provide statistics on dialect distribution, token counts, and segmentation
characteristics. Unlike existing Swiss German speech corpora, which primarily
feature controlled speech, this corpus captures natural, spontaneous
conversations, making it a valuable resource for real-world speech
applications.

TL;DR: LLM-as-Judge frameworks show weak correlation between models' generation and judgment abilities. A self-reference-guided evaluation strategy using models' own answers as references significantly improves this correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistent research findings on the relationship between LLMs' generation and judgment capabilities, and to provide a reliable proxy for model selection in evaluation tasks.

Method: Systematic dataset- and instance-level analyses across 11 models and 21 diverse tasks, followed by proposing a self-reference-guided evaluation strategy that uses a model's own answers as references.

Result: Generation and judgment abilities are only weakly correlated despite relying on the same underlying knowledge, primarily due to LLMs' sensitivity to the responses being judged. The proposed self-reference approach significantly strengthens this correlation.

Conclusion: The self-reference-guided evaluation strategy offers a practical path to align generation and judgment skills, providing a reliable proxy for model selection in evaluation tasks.

Abstract: LLM-as-Judge frameworks are increasingly popular for AI evaluation, yet
research findings on the relationship between models' generation and judgment
abilities remain inconsistent. We investigate this relationship through
systematic dataset- and instance-level analyses across 11 models and 21 diverse
tasks. Despite both capabilities relying on the same underlying knowledge, our
analyses reveal they are only weakly correlated, primarily due to LLMs'
sensitivity to the responses being judged. To address this, we propose a
self-reference-guided evaluation strategy that leverages a model's own answers
as references. This approach significantly strengthens the correlation between
generation and judgment abilities, offering a practical path to align these
skills and providing a reliable proxy for model selection in evaluation tasks.

### [130] [Future Policy Aware Preference Learning for Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19893)
*Minjae Oh,Yunho Choi,Dongmin Choi,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FPA preference learning addresses DPO's over-penalization issue in mathematical reasoning by using future policy estimation for proactive regularization, enabling safer training and performance gains up to 5.75% on MATH and GSM8K benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard preference learning methods like DPO are ineffective for mathematical reasoning due to large token overlap between preferred and dispreferred trajectories, causing over-penalization of shared useful tokens and performance collapse.

Method: Proposes Future Policy Aware (FPA) preference learning that replaces current policy with future policy in regularization term, estimated via lightweight logit-space extrapolation from reference model to current model for proactive regularization.

Result: FPA applied to DPO, RPO, and SimPER yields consistent performance gains on MATH and GSM8K benchmarks, with largest improvements (up to 5.75%) using SimPER, enabling longer degradation-free training with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: FPA provides proactive regularization that preserves probability of shared useful mathematical tokens, effectively addressing over-penalization issues in preference learning for mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Preference learning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have
become standard for Large Language Model (LLM) post-training, yet they are
often ineffective for mathematical reasoning. A key challenge is the large
token overlap between preferred and dispreferred trajectories; lowering the
probability of dispreferred trajectories also reduces the probability of shared
useful tokens, leading to over-penalization and overall performance collapse.
As a mitigation, existing algorithms include the probability of a trajectory
under the current policy as a regularization term, which decreases the effect
of the gradient when the probability is low. However, by the time this effect
takes hold, useful tokens may have already been over-penalized as the model has
begun to degrade. To address this, we propose Future Policy Aware (FPA)
preference learning, which replaces the current policy with a future policy in
the regularization term. This future policy is estimated via lightweight,
logit-space extrapolation from a reference model toward the current model. FPA
enables safer training by preemptively regularizing potentially problematic
gradients. We apply FPA to DPO, RPO, and SimPER and evaluate them on the MATH
and GSM8K benchmarks. FPA yields consistent performance gains, with the largest
improvements observed with SimPER, achieving gains of up to 5.75%. We
demonstrate that FPA provides proactive regularization while preserving the
probability of shared, useful mathematical tokens, and enables longer,
degradation-free training with negligible computational overhead. We will
release our code publicly upon publication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CorIL, a large-scale annotated parallel corpus for 11 Indian languages covering Government, Health, and General domains, totaling 772,000 sentence pairs, and establishes benchmarks using state-of-the-art NMT models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality parallel corpora for Indian languages remain scarce despite linguistic diversity, hindering progress in multilingual neural machine translation research and applications.

Method: Curated a systematic parallel corpus across three domains, then fine-tuned and evaluated several state-of-the-art NMT models (IndicTrans2, NLLB, BhashaVerse) to establish performance benchmarks and analyze domain sensitivity and cross-script transfer learning.

Result: Analysis revealed distinct performance patterns based on language script - massively multilingual models showed advantage on Perso-Arabic scripts (Urdu, Sindhi) while other models excelled on Indic scripts, with detailed domain-wise performance insights.

Conclusion: The publicly released CorIL corpus significantly improves availability of high-quality training data for Indian languages and provides a valuable resource for the machine translation research community, enabling better domain-aware translation research.

Abstract: India's linguistic landscape is one of the most diverse in the world,
comprising over 120 major languages and approximately 1,600 additional
languages, with 22 officially recognized as scheduled languages in the Indian
Constitution. Despite recent progress in multilingual neural machine
translation (NMT), high-quality parallel corpora for Indian languages remain
scarce, especially across varied domains. In this paper, we introduce a
large-scale, high-quality annotated parallel corpus covering 11 of these
languages : English, Telugu, Hindi, Punjabi, Odia, Kashmiri, Sindhi, Dogri,
Kannada, Urdu, and Gujarati comprising a total of 772,000 bi-text sentence
pairs. The dataset is carefully curated and systematically categorized into
three key domains: Government, Health, and General, to enable domain-aware
machine translation research and facilitate effective domain adaptation. To
demonstrate the utility of CorIL and establish strong benchmarks for future
research, we fine-tune and evaluate several state-of-the-art NMT models,
including IndicTrans2, NLLB, and BhashaVerse. Our analysis reveals important
performance trends and highlights the corpus's value in probing model
capabilities. For instance, the results show distinct performance patterns
based on language script, with massively multilingual models showing an
advantage on Perso-Arabic scripts (Urdu, Sindhi) while other models excel on
Indic scripts. This paper provides a detailed domain-wise performance analysis,
offering insights into domain sensitivity and cross-script transfer learning.
By publicly releasing CorIL, we aim to significantly improve the availability
of high-quality training data for Indian languages and provide a valuable
resource for the machine translation research community.

*Jan Broersen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based conversational agents exhibit a fundamental disconnect between their knowledge and behavior, which cannot be resolved through more data or training due to core training limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs use their knowledge as a basis for conversational behavior, and to identify the fundamental limitations causing hallucinations in AI responses.

Method: Philosophical analysis of LLM training techniques and behavioral patterns, examining the disconnect between knowledge representation and conversational output.

Result: The disconnect is inherent to LLM architecture and cannot be eliminated through scaling or additional training; ethical alignment techniques may exacerbate the problem.

Conclusion: LLMs have a fundamental limitation in connecting knowledge to behavior, explaining hallucinations, and this disconnect persists despite various training interventions.

Abstract: Large language model-based artificial conversational agents (like ChatGPT)
give answers to all kinds of questions, and often enough these answers are
correct. Just on the basis of that capacity alone, we may attribute knowledge
to them. But do these models use this knowledge as a basis for their own
conversational behaviour? I argue this is not the case, and I will refer to
this failure as a `disconnect'. I further argue this disconnect is fundamental
in the sense that with more data and more training of the LLM on which a
conversational chatbot is based, it will not disappear. The reason is, as I
will claim, that the core technique used to train LLMs does not allow for the
establishment of the connection we are after. The disconnect reflects a
fundamental limitation on the capacities of LLMs, and explains the source of
hallucinations. I will furthermore consider the ethical version of the
disconnect (ethical conversational knowledge not being aligned with ethical
conversational behaviour), since in this domain researchers have come up with
several additional techniques to influence a chatbot's behaviour. I will
discuss how these techniques do nothing to solve the disconnect and can make it
worse.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiffNator is a framework that generates structured explanations of differences between two time series using a JSON schema and a model combining time-series encoding with frozen LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In IoT applications, understanding differences between sensor signals is crucial but requires expert knowledge, creating a need for automated interpretation tools.

Method: Design a JSON schema to capture difference properties, use TORI dataset to generate paired sequences, train a model combining time-series encoder with frozen LLM to output JSON-formatted explanations.

Result: DiffNator generates accurate difference explanations and significantly outperforms both visual question answering baseline and retrieval method using pre-trained time-series encoder.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully automates the interpretation of time-series differences, providing structured explanations that surpass existing methods.

Abstract: In many IoT applications, the central interest lies not in individual sensor
signals but in their differences, yet interpreting such differences requires
expert knowledge. We propose DiffNator, a framework for structured explanations
of differences between two time series. We first design a JSON schema that
captures the essential properties of such differences. Using the Time-series
Observations of Real-world IoT (TORI) dataset, we generate paired sequences and
train a model that combine a time-series encoder with a frozen LLM to output
JSON-formatted explanations. Experimental results show that DiffNator generates
accurate difference explanations and substantially outperforms both a visual
question answering (VQA) baseline and a retrieval method using a pre-trained
time-series encoder.

*Vani Kanjirangat,Tanja Samardžić,Ljiljana Dolamic,Fabio Rinaldi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how Tokenization Parity (TP) and Information Parity (IP) predict model performance on dialectal data across different tasks, revealing TP is better for syntax-dependent tasks while IP better predicts semantic task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialectal data shows small linguistic variations that significantly impact model performance, but existing explanations (data size, economic/social factors) are inconsistent. The study aims to directly correlate representational biases (TP and IP) with downstream performance.

Method: Compare state-of-the-art decoder-only LLMs with encoder-based models across three tasks (dialect classification, topic classification, extractive QA), controlling for scripts (Latin vs. non-Latin) and resource availability (high vs. low). Analyze tokenizer behavior, vocabulary coverage, and qualitative insights.

Result: TP is a better predictor for syntax/morphology-dependent tasks (e.g., extractive QA), while IP better predicts performance in semantic tasks (e.g., topic classification). Language support claims of LLMs often mask deeper mismatches at script or token level.

Conclusion: Tokenization Parity and Information Parity are effective measures for understanding representational biases in multilingual models, with task-specific predictive power. LLM language support claims may be misleading due to underlying script and token-level mismatches.

Abstract: Dialectal data are characterized by linguistic variation that appears small
to humans but has a significant impact on the performance of models. This
dialect gap has been related to various factors (e.g., data size, economic and
social factors) whose impact, however, turns out to be inconsistent. In this
work, we investigate factors impacting the model performance more directly: we
correlate Tokenization Parity (TP) and Information Parity (IP), as measures of
representational biases in pre-trained multilingual models, with the downstream
performance. We compare state-of-the-art decoder-only LLMs with encoder-based
models across three tasks: dialect classification, topic classification, and
extractive question answering, controlling for varying scripts (Latin vs.
non-Latin) and resource availability (high vs. low). Our analysis reveals that
TP is a better predictor of the performance on tasks reliant on syntactic and
morphological cues (e.g., extractive QA), while IP better predicts performance
in semantic tasks (e.g., topic classification). Complementary analyses,
including tokenizer behavior, vocabulary coverage, and qualitative insights,
reveal that the language support claims of LLMs often might mask deeper
mismatches at the script or token level.

TL;DR: Proposes an input-only method using token-level likelihood features to predict language model failures on idiomatic/figurative inputs, outperforming baselines across five challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models often fail on idiomatic, figurative, or context-sensitive inputs due to input misinterpretation rather than flawed outputs, creating a need for pre-generation error prediction.

Method: Uses token-level likelihood features inspired by surprisal and Uniform Information Density hypothesis to capture localized uncertainty in input comprehension, requiring no access to outputs or hidden activations.

Result: Method outperforms standard baselines across five linguistically challenging datasets, with span-localized features improving error detection for larger models and global patterns benefiting smaller models.

Conclusion: Provides a lightweight, generalizable input-only approach for pre-generation error prediction that effectively anticipates language model failures on challenging linguistic inputs.

Abstract: Language models often struggle with idiomatic, figurative, or
context-sensitive inputs, not because they produce flawed outputs, but because
they misinterpret the input from the outset. We propose an input-only method
for anticipating such failures using token-level likelihood features inspired
by surprisal and the Uniform Information Density hypothesis. These features
capture localized uncertainty in input comprehension and outperform standard
baselines across five linguistically challenging datasets. We show that
span-localized features improve error detection for larger models, while
smaller models benefit from global patterns. Our method requires no access to
outputs or hidden activations, offering a lightweight and generalizable
approach to pre-generation error prediction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TtT is a unified audio-text modeling framework that combines autoregressive text generation with non-autoregressive audio diffusion in a single Transformer architecture, addressing the asymmetry in dependency structures between text and audio tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models for speech-in speech-out systems require complex multi-stage training and uniformly apply autoregressive generation to both text and audio tokens, ignoring the fundamental asymmetry where text tokens need causal ordering while audio tokens are driven by source-target dependencies.

Method: Proposes TtT framework that integrates AR text generation with non-autoregressive audio diffusion within a single Transformer architecture initialized from a pretrained LLM.

Result: Not specified in the abstract.

Conclusion: The proposed approach aims to provide a more efficient and effective solution for multimodal speech-in speech-out conversational systems by better aligning with the inherent characteristics of text and audio dependencies.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have attracted significant interest
in extending their capabilities to multimodal scenarios, particularly for
speech-in speech-out conversational systems. However, existing multimodal
models handling interleaved audio and text, such as MOSHI require complex multi
stage training pipelines, incurring substantial computational costs. Moreover,
these models uniformly apply autoregressive generation to both text and audio
tokens, overlooking a fundamental asymmetry in their dependency structures:
while text tokens exhibit strong target target dependencies requiring causal
ordering, audio tokens are predominantly driven by source target dependencies,
where audio outputs primarily condition on source text rather than preceding
audio tokens. In this work, we propose TtT, a unified audio-text modeling
framework that integrates AR text generation with non-autoregressive audio
diffusion within a single Transformer architecture initialized from a
pretrained LLM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses sequence-to-sequence models' limitations in compositionality and systematic generalization by introducing an unsupervised method to mine pseudo-constructions from training data, achieving significant gains on out-of-distribution splits in the SCAN dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequence-to-sequence models struggle with compositionality and systematic generalization, failing to internalize conventionalized form-meaning pairings that enable productive recombination.

Method: An unsupervised procedure for mining pseudo-constructions—variable-slot templates automatically extracted from training data—without architectural changes or additional supervision.

Result: Large gains on out-of-distribution splits: accuracy rises to 47.8% on ADD JUMP and 20.3% on AROUND RIGHT. Competitive performance with 40% of the original training data, demonstrating strong data efficiency.

Conclusion: Construction-aware preprocessing is a promising alternative to heavy architectural or training-regime interventions for improving compositionality and systematic generalization in sequence-to-sequence models.

Abstract: Sequence to Sequence models struggle at compositionality and systematic
generalisation even while they excel at many other tasks. We attribute this
limitation to their failure to internalise constructions conventionalised form
meaning pairings that license productive recombination. Building on these
insights, we introduce an unsupervised procedure for mining
pseudo-constructions: variable-slot templates automatically extracted from
training data. When applied to the SCAN dataset, our method yields large gains
out-of-distribution splits: accuracy rises to 47.8 %on ADD JUMP and to 20.3% on
AROUND RIGHT without any architectural changes or additional supervision. The
model also attains competitive performance with? 40% of the original training
data, demonstrating strong data efAciency. Our findings highlight the promise
of construction-aware preprocessing as an alternative to heavy architectural or

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OLaPh is a phonemization framework that combines large lexica, NLP techniques, and compound resolution with probabilistic scoring, achieving improved accuracy in German and English over previous methods, and enhanced further by training an LLM on its generated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional phonemization systems struggle with names, loanwords, abbreviations, and homographs, creating a need for more robust and accurate approaches that can handle out-of-domain vocabulary effectively.

Method: The OLaPh framework integrates large lexica, multiple NLP techniques, and compound resolution with a probabilistic scoring function. Additionally, a large language model is trained on data generated by OLaPh to address unresolved cases and improve generalization.

Result: Evaluations in German and English demonstrate improved phonemization accuracy over previous approaches, including on challenging datasets. The LLM trained on OLaPh data achieves even stronger generalization and performance.

Conclusion: The combined framework and LLM enhance phonemization consistency and provide a freely available resource for future research, addressing key limitations of existing systems.

Abstract: Phonemization, the conversion of text into phonemes, is a key step in
text-to-speech. Traditional approaches use rule-based transformations and
lexicon lookups, while more advanced methods apply preprocessing techniques or
neural networks for improved accuracy on out-of-domain vocabulary. However, all
systems struggle with names, loanwords, abbreviations, and homographs. This
work presents OLaPh (Optimal Language Phonemizer), a framework that combines
large lexica, multiple NLP techniques, and compound resolution with a
probabilistic scoring function. Evaluations in German and English show improved
accuracy over previous approaches, including on a challenging dataset. To
further address unresolved cases, we train a large language model on
OLaPh-generated data, which achieves even stronger generalization and
performance. Together, the framework and LLM improve phonemization consistency
and provide a freely available resource for future research.

### [141] [Causal Understanding by LLMs: The Role of Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20088)
*Oscar Lithgow-Serrano,Vani Kanjirangat,Alessandro Antonucci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show near-random accuracy in causal relation classification, with failures stemming from lack of structured causal representation rather than insufficient pretraining exposure to causal examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs' poor performance in causal relation classification arises from limited pretraining exposure or deeper representational gaps in understanding causality.

Method: Evaluated 7 models on 18K PubMed sentences using causal classification (4-way: direct/conditional/correlational/no-relationship) and verbatim memorization probing (original vs. paraphrase selection). Analyzed performance on seen/unseen sentences and output entropy.

Result: Models showed almost identical accuracy on seen/unseen sentences (p>0.05), no memorization bias (24.8% original selection), flat output distributions with high entropy (1.35/1.39), and instruction-tuned models exhibited severe miscalibration (Qwen: 95% confidence, 32.8% accuracy, ECE=0.49).

Conclusion: Failures in causal understanding arise from lack of structured causal representation, not insufficient exposure to causal examples during pretraining.

Abstract: Recent papers show LLMs achieve near-random accuracy in causal relation
classification, raising questions about whether such failures arise from
limited pretraining exposure or deeper representational gaps. We investigate
this under uncertainty-based evaluation, testing whether pretraining exposure
to causal examples improves causal understanding >18K PubMed sentences -- half
from The Pile corpus, half post-2024 -- across seven models
(Pythia-1.4B/7B/12B, GPT-J-6B, Dolly-7B/12B, Qwen-7B). We analyze model
behavior through: (i) causal classification, where the model identifies causal
relationships in text, and (ii) verbatim memorization probing, where we assess
whether the model prefers previously seen causal statements over their
paraphrases. Models perform four-way classification
(direct/conditional/correlational/no-relationship) and select between originals
and their generated paraphrases. Results show almost identical accuracy on
seen/unseen sentences (p > 0.05), no memorization bias (24.8% original
selection), and output distribution over the possible options is almost flat,
with entropic values near the maximum (1.35/1.39), confirming random guessing.
Instruction-tuned models show severe miscalibration (Qwen: > 95% confidence,
32.8% accuracy, ECE=0.49). Conditional relations induce highest entropy (+11%
vs. direct). These findings suggest that failures in causal understanding arise
from the lack of structured causal representation, rather than insufficient
exposure to causal examples during pretraining.

*Sujeong Lee,Hayoung Lee,Seongsoo Heo,Wonik Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPEED is an integrated evaluation framework that uses specialized functional experts for comprehensive descriptive analysis of LLM outputs, addressing limitations of traditional benchmark-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional benchmark-based evaluation methods rely on fixed reference answers and fail to capture qualitative aspects of generated responses, necessitating a more robust evaluation approach.

Method: SPEED employs self-refining descriptive evaluation with expert-driven diagnostics, utilizing specialized functional experts for multi-dimensional analysis including hallucination detection, toxicity assessment, and lexical-contextual appropriateness.

Result: Experimental results show SPEED achieves robust and consistent evaluation performance across diverse domains and datasets, with superior resource efficiency using compact expert models compared to larger-scale evaluators.

Conclusion: SPEED significantly enhances fairness and interpretability in LLM evaluations, offering a promising alternative to existing evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Reliable evaluation of large language models is essential to ensure their
applicability in practical scenarios. Traditional benchmark-based evaluation
methods often rely on fixed reference answers, limiting their ability to
capture important qualitative aspects of generated responses. To address these
shortcomings, we propose an integrated evaluation framework called
\textit{self-refining descriptive evaluation with expert-driven diagnostics},
SPEED, which utilizes specialized functional experts to perform comprehensive,
descriptive analyses of model outputs. Unlike conventional approaches, SPEED
actively incorporates expert feedback across multiple dimensions, including
hallucination detection, toxicity assessment, and lexical-contextual
appropriateness. Experimental results demonstrate that SPEED achieves robust
and consistent evaluation performance across diverse domains and datasets.
Additionally, by employing relatively compact expert models, SPEED demonstrates
superior resource efficiency compared to larger-scale evaluators. These
findings illustrate that SPEED significantly enhances fairness and
interpretability in LLM evaluations, offering a promising alternative to
existing evaluation methodologies.

*York Hay Ng,Phuong Hanh Hoang,En-Shiun Annie Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a pipeline to optimize URIEL+ typological feature space through feature selection and imputation, creating compact representations that improve linguistic distance metrics and multilingual NLP performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High dimensionality and sparsity of linguistic feature datasets like URIEL+ limit the effectiveness of distance metrics, especially for low-resource languages.

Method: Combines feature selection and imputation techniques to optimize the URIEL+ typological feature space, producing compact yet interpretable representations.

Result: Reduced-size representations yield more informative distance metrics and improve performance in linguistic distance alignment and downstream multilingual NLP tasks.

Conclusion: Compact typological representations can enhance cross-lingual modeling by providing more effective distance metrics for multilingual applications.

Abstract: Linguistic feature datasets such as URIEL+ are valuable for modelling
cross-lingual relationships, but their high dimensionality and sparsity,
especially for low-resource languages, limit the effectiveness of distance
metrics. We propose a pipeline to optimize the URIEL+ typological feature space
by combining feature selection and imputation, producing compact yet
interpretable typological representations. We evaluate these feature subsets on
linguistic distance alignment and downstream tasks, demonstrating that
reduced-size representations of language typology can yield more informative
distance metrics and improve performance in multilingual NLP applications.

### [144] [Embedding Domain Knowledge for Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning from Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20162)
*Chaojun Nie,Jun Zhou,Guanxiang Wang,Shisong Wud,Zichen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLAG (Reinforcement Learning from Augmented Generation) addresses knowledge gaps in LLMs for domain-specific tasks by iteratively sampling generations and optimizing models with tailored rewards, outperforming traditional CPT and SFT methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with domain-specific tasks due to knowledge scarcity and temporal lag in training data. Existing approaches like CPT and SFT have limitations - CPT treats all tokens equally without prioritizing critical knowledge, while SFT fails to develop coherent knowledge structures for complex reasoning.

Method: RLAG iteratively cycles between sampling generations (selecting outputs with highest log probabilities) and optimizing the model through three tailored reward metrics. The approach focuses on embedding critical and contextually coherent domain knowledge.

Result: Experimental results across medical, legal, astronomy, and current events datasets show that RLAG significantly outperforms baseline approaches, with comprehensive evaluation of both answer accuracy and explanation rationality.

Conclusion: RLAG effectively addresses knowledge gaps in domain applications by prioritizing critical knowledge points and developing coherent knowledge structures, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit limited performance on
domain-specific tasks due to the natural disproportionate representation of
specialized information in their training data and the static nature of these
datasets. Knowledge scarcity and temporal lag create knowledge gaps for domain
applications. While post-training on domain datasets can embed knowledge into
models, existing approaches have some limitations. Continual Pre-Training (CPT)
treats all tokens in domain documents with equal importance, failing to
prioritize critical knowledge points, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
question-answer pairs struggles to develop the coherent knowledge structures
necessary for complex reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose
Reinforcement Learning from Augmented Generation (RLAG). Our approach
iteratively cycles between sampling generations and optimizing the model
through calculated rewards, effectively embedding critical and contextually
coherent domain knowledge. We select generated outputs with the highest log
probabilities as the sampling result, then compute three tailored reward
metrics to guide the optimization process. To comprehensively evaluate domain
expertise, we assess answer accuracy and the rationality of explanations
generated for correctly answered questions. Experimental results across
medical, legal, astronomy, and current events datasets demonstrate that our
proposed method significantly outperforms baseline approaches. Our code and
data are open sourced at https://github.com/ChaojunNie/RLAG.

*Ghazal Kalhor,Behnam Bahrak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a template-based probing methodology to uncover gender stereotypes in multilingual LLMs, focusing on Persian as a low-resource language, and introduces the DS-GSI metric to quantify gender bias deviations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual LLMs are widely used but gender bias in low-resource languages remains understudied, particularly for languages like Persian with distinct linguistic features, creating representational harm risks.

Method: Template-based probing methodology validated against real-world data, using Domain-Specific Gender Skew Index (DS-GSI) metric to quantify gender parity deviations. Evaluated GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Qwen QwQ 32B across four semantic domains.

Result: All models exhibited gender stereotypes, with greater disparities in Persian than English across all domains. Sports domain showed the most rigid gender biases.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for inclusive NLP practices and provides a framework for assessing bias in other low-resource languages, demonstrating that current models fail to achieve gender parity in underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used worldwide,
making it essential to ensure they are free from gender bias to prevent
representational harm. While prior studies have examined such biases in
high-resource languages, low-resource languages remain understudied. In this
paper, we propose a template-based probing methodology, validated against
real-world data, to uncover gender stereotypes in LLMs. As part of this
framework, we introduce the Domain-Specific Gender Skew Index (DS-GSI), a
metric that quantifies deviations from gender parity. We evaluate four
prominent models, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Qwen QwQ 32B,
across four semantic domains, focusing on Persian, a low-resource language with
distinct linguistic features. Our results show that all models exhibit gender
stereotypes, with greater disparities in Persian than in English across all
domains. Among these, sports reflect the most rigid gender biases. This study
underscores the need for inclusive NLP practices and provides a framework for
assessing bias in other low-resource languages.

*Liang Wang,Nan Yang,Shaohan Huang,Li Dong,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TPT (Thinking augmented Pre-Training) improves LLM data efficiency by 3x through automatically generated thinking trajectories that augment text data with step-by-step reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The compute for pre-training LLMs is growing rapidly while high-quality data remains limited. Certain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn due to complex underlying rationales that exceed fixed model capacity.

Method: TPT augments existing text data with automatically generated thinking trajectories, which decompose complex reasoning into step-by-step processes. This increases training data volume and makes high-quality tokens more learnable.

Result: TPT improves data efficiency by 3x and boosts performance across various model sizes. For a 3B parameter model, it achieves over 10% improvement on challenging reasoning benchmarks. The method works effectively in diverse training configurations up to 100B tokens.

Conclusion: Thinking trajectory augmentation is a simple and scalable approach that substantially improves LLM performance and data efficiency, making it a universal methodology applicable across different model families and training scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces a simple and scalable approach to improve the data
efficiency of large language model (LLM) training by augmenting existing text
data with thinking trajectories. The compute for pre-training LLMs has been
growing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data
remains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data
constitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that
certain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model
capacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally
complex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented
Pre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with
automatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively
increases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more
learnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across
diverse training configurations up to $100$B tokens, encompassing pre-training
with both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong
open-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method
substantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and
families. Notably, TPT enhances the data efficiency of LLM pre-training by a
factor of $3$. For a $3$B parameter model, it improves the post-training
performance by over $10\%$ on several challenging reasoning benchmarks.

*Parker Glenn,Alfy Samuel,Daben Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an efficient solution for integrating LLM-powered operators in declarative query languages, showing that small language models can effectively execute functions over hybrid data sources while ensuring well-typed outputs with improved accuracy and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for integrating LLM operators in query languages require many LLM-based post-processing calls to ensure alignment between generated outputs and database values, creating performance bottlenecks.

Method: The study evaluates various sized open-source language models for parsing and executing functions within SQL-based query languages, and proposes an efficient solution to enforce well-typedness of LLM functions.

Result: The proposed solution demonstrates 7% accuracy improvement on a multi-hop question answering dataset with 53% improvement in latency over comparable solutions.

Conclusion: Small language models can excel as function executors over hybrid data sources, and the proposed efficient typing enforcement enables better performance for LLM integration in declarative query languages.

Abstract: Integrating LLM powered operators in declarative query languages allows for
the combination of cheap and interpretable functions with powerful,
generalizable language model reasoning. However, in order to benefit from the
optimized execution of a database query language like SQL, generated outputs
must align with the rules enforced by both type checkers and database contents.
Current approaches address this challenge with orchestrations consisting of
many LLM-based post-processing calls to ensure alignment between generated
outputs and database values, introducing performance bottlenecks. We perform a
study on the ability of various sized open-source language models to both parse
and execute functions within a query language based on SQL, showing that small
language models can excel as function executors over hybrid data sources. Then,
we propose an efficient solution to enforce the well-typedness of LLM
functions, demonstrating 7% accuracy improvement on a multi-hop question
answering dataset with 53% improvement in latency over comparable solutions. We

TL;DR: This paper proposes transfer learning techniques using multilingual pretrained models to improve English-Tigrinya translation for low-resource languages, addressing challenges like limited corpora and inadequate tokenization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource languages like Tigrinya are underserved in NMT due to limited corpora, poor tokenization strategies, and lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks, creating a performance gap that needs bridging.

Method: The approach integrates language-specific tokenization, informed embedding initialization, and domain-adaptive fine-tuning using transfer learning with multilingual pretrained models. A high-quality human-aligned English-Tigrinya evaluation dataset was constructed for rigorous assessment.

Result: Transfer learning with custom tokenizer substantially outperforms zero-shot baselines, with gains validated by BLEU, chrF, and qualitative human evaluation. Statistical significance was confirmed using Bonferroni correction.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance of linguistically aware modeling and reproducible benchmarks for improving translation quality in underrepresented languages, with resources made publicly available.

Abstract: Despite advances in Neural Machine Translation (NMT), low-resource languages
like Tigrinya remain underserved due to persistent challenges, including
limited corpora, inadequate tokenization strategies, and the lack of
standardized evaluation benchmarks. This paper investigates transfer learning
techniques using multilingual pretrained models to enhance translation quality
for morphologically rich, low-resource languages. We propose a refined approach
that integrates language-specific tokenization, informed embedding
initialization, and domain-adaptive fine-tuning. To enable rigorous assessment,
we construct a high-quality, human-aligned English-Tigrinya evaluation dataset
covering diverse domains. Experimental results demonstrate that transfer
learning with a custom tokenizer substantially outperforms zero-shot baselines,
with gains validated by BLEU, chrF, and qualitative human evaluation.
Bonferroni correction is applied to ensure statistical significance across

*Yu Wang,Leyi Lao,Langchu Huang,Gabriel Skantze,Yang Xu,Hendrik Buschmeier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies how fine-tuning language models can improve their representation and generation of backchannels and fillers in dialogue systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backchannels and fillers are important linguistic expressions in dialogue but are under-represented in modern transformer-based language models, limiting their ability to produce human-like conversational language.

Method: Three fine-tuning strategies applied to language models trained on three dialogue corpora (English and Japanese) with preserved backchannels and fillers. Used clustering analysis and NLG metrics to evaluate representation learning.

Result: Fine-tuned models showed increased silhouette scores in clustering analysis, indicating better distinction of nuanced semantic variations in backchannels/fillers. NLG metrics confirmed generated utterances more closely resembled human-produced language.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning enables LMs to better represent and generate backchannels and fillers, suggesting potential for transforming general LMs into more capable conversational LMs that produce human-like language.

Abstract: Backchannels and fillers are important linguistic expressions in dialogue,
but are under-represented in modern transformer-based language models (LMs).
Our work studies the representation of them in language models using three
fine-tuning strategies. The models are trained on three dialogue corpora in
English and Japanese, where backchannels and fillers are preserved and
annotated, to investigate how fine-tuning can help LMs learn their
representations. We first apply clustering analysis to the learnt
representation of backchannels and fillers, and have found increased silhouette
scores in representations from fine-tuned models, which suggests that
fine-tuning enables LMs to distinguish the nuanced semantic variation in
different backchannel and filler use. We also use natural language generation
(NLG) metrics to confirm that the utterances generated by fine-tuned language
models resemble human-produced utterances more closely. Our findings suggest
the potentials of transforming general LMs into conversational LMs that are
more capable of producing human-like languages adequately.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 'Instruction Boundary' vulnerability in LLMs, where biased or incomplete prompts lead to unreliable reasoning, and presents BiasDetector framework to measure biases from different instruction types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM reasoning is powerful but limitations from prompt design remain underexplored. Users may unintentionally supply biased or incomplete prompts, misleading LLMs and creating reliability risks.

Method: Introduces BiasDetector framework that measures biases arising from three instruction types (complete, redundant, insufficient) and evaluates several mainstream LLMs across eight concrete facets of the Instruction Boundary phenomenon.

Result: Despite high headline accuracy, substantial biases persist in many downstream tasks as a direct consequence of prompt coverage. LLM reasoning reliability can still be significantly improved.

Conclusion: Findings underscore the need for developers to tackle biases and for users to craft prompts carefully. The paper analyzes practical impact of these biases and outlines mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM) reasoning has long been regarded as a powerful
tool for problem solving across domains, providing non-experts with valuable
advice. However, their limitations - especially those stemming from prompt
design - remain underexplored. Because users may supply biased or incomplete
prompts - often unintentionally - LLMs can be misled, undermining reliability
and creating risks. We refer to this vulnerability as the Instruction Boundary.
To investigate the phenomenon, we distill it into eight concrete facets and
introduce BiasDetector, a framework that measures biases arising from three
instruction types: complete, redundant, and insufficient. We evaluate several
mainstream LLMs and find that, despite high headline accuracy, substantial
biases persist in many downstream tasks as a direct consequence of prompt
coverage. Our empirical study confirms that LLM reasoning reliability can still
be significantly improved. We analyze the practical impact of these biases and
outline mitigation strategies. Our findings underscore the need for developers
to tackle biases and for users to craft options carefully.

*Behzad Shayegh,Jan-Thorsten Peter,David Vilar,Tobias Domhan,Juraj Juraska,Markus Freitag,Lili Mou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the tradeoff between adequacy and fluency in machine translation evaluation, showing current metrics favor adequacy and that WMT meta-evaluation has a bias toward adequacy-oriented metrics due to dataset composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the bias in machine translation evaluation where current metrics and meta-evaluation methods favor adequacy over fluency, potentially leading to unfair metric rankings.

Method: The authors analyze the adequacy-fluency tradeoff at both evaluation and meta-evaluation levels, and propose a method to synthesize translation systems in meta-evaluation to control for bias.

Result: Current metrics generally correlate more strongly with adequacy than fluency, and WMT meta-evaluation favors adequacy-oriented metrics due to the composition of systems in datasets.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of understanding the adequacy-fluency tradeoff in meta-evaluation and its impact on metric rankings, suggesting the need for balanced evaluation approaches.

Abstract: We investigate the tradeoff between adequacy and fluency in machine
translation. We show the severity of this tradeoff at the evaluation level and
analyze where popular metrics fall within it. Essentially, current metrics
generally lean toward adequacy, meaning that their scores correlate more
strongly with the adequacy of translations than with fluency. More importantly,
we find that this tradeoff also persists at the meta-evaluation level, and that
the standard WMT meta-evaluation favors adequacy-oriented metrics over
fluency-oriented ones. We show that this bias is partially attributed to the
composition of the systems included in the meta-evaluation datasets. To control
this bias, we propose a method that synthesizes translation systems in
meta-evaluation. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding this
tradeoff in meta-evaluation and its impact on metric rankings.

*Xilin Wei,Xiaoran Liu,Yuhang Zang,Xiaoyi Dong,Yuhang Cao,Jiaqi Wang,Xipeng Qiu,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SIM-CoT addresses instability in implicit Chain-of-Thought methods by introducing step-level supervision through an auxiliary decoder during training, improving performance and scalability while maintaining token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit CoT methods offer token efficiency but suffer from performance gaps and instability when scaling computational budget, caused by latent representations becoming homogeneous due to insufficient step-level supervision.

Method: Proposes SIM-CoT with an auxiliary decoder that aligns each implicit token with explicit reasoning steps during training, providing step-level supervision to stabilize latent representations. The decoder is removed during inference to maintain efficiency.

Result: Significantly improves implicit CoT performance: +8.2% on GPT-2, +3.0% on LLaMA-3.1 8B. Surpasses explicit CoT baseline on GPT-2 by 2.1% with 2.3× greater token efficiency, while closing performance gap on larger models.

Conclusion: SIM-CoT successfully stabilizes implicit CoT training, enhances both accuracy and stability, provides interpretability through step visualization, and demonstrates strong scalability while preserving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Implicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods present a promising, token-efficient
alternative to explicit CoT reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), but a
persistent performance gap has limited the application of implicit CoT. We
identify a core latent instability issue by scaling the computational budget of
implicit CoT approaches: as we increase the number of implicit reasoning tokens
to enhance performance, the training process often becomes unstable and
collapses. Our analysis reveals that this instability arises from the latent
representations becoming homogeneous and losing their semantic diversity, a
failure caused by insufficient step-level supervision in existing implicit CoT
approaches. To address this issue, we propose SIM-CoT, a plug-and-play training
module that introduces step-level supervision to stabilize and enrich the
latent reasoning space. Specifically, SIM-CoT employs an auxiliary decoder
during training to align each implicit token with its corresponding explicit
reasoning step, ensuring that latent states capture distinct and meaningful
information. The proposed auxiliary decoder is removed during inference,
preserving the computational efficiency of implicit CoT methods with no added
overhead. In addition, the auxiliary decoder affords interpretability of
implicit reasoning by projecting each latent token onto an explicit reasoning
vocabulary, enabling per-step visualization of semantic roles and diagnosis.
SIM-CoT significantly enhances both the in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain
stability of various implicit CoT methods, boosting baselines like Coconut by
+8.2% on GPT-2 and CODI by +3.0% on LLaMA-3.1 8B. Demonstrating strong
scalability, SIM-CoT also surpasses the explicit CoT baseline on GPT-2 by 2.1%
with 2.3\times greater token efficiency, while substantially closing the
performance gap on larger models like LLaMA-3.1 8B.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Z-Scores is a new span-level evaluation metric for disfluency removal that categorizes system behavior by disfluency types (EDITED, INTJ, PRN), providing more detailed diagnostics than traditional word-level metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional word-based metrics like precision, recall, and F1 capture overall performance but cannot reveal why models succeed or fail or expose systematic weaknesses in disfluency removal systems.

Method: Introduces Z-Scores with a deterministic alignment module that enables robust mapping between generated text and disfluent transcripts, allowing category-specific evaluation across distinct disfluency types.

Result: Z-Scores expose systematic weaknesses that word-level metrics obscure, enabling identification of model failure modes and informing targeted interventions like tailored prompts or data augmentation.

Conclusion: Z-Scores provide linguistically-grounded diagnostics that uncover challenges with specific disfluency types (INTJ, PRN) hidden in aggregate F1 scores, directly informing model refinement strategies for improved disfluency removal.

Abstract: Evaluating disfluency removal in speech requires more than aggregate
token-level scores. Traditional word-based metrics such as precision, recall,
and F1 (E-Scores) capture overall performance but cannot reveal why models
succeed or fail. We introduce Z-Scores, a span-level linguistically-grounded
evaluation metric that categorizes system behavior across distinct disfluency
types (EDITED, INTJ, PRN). Our deterministic alignment module enables robust
mapping between generated text and disfluent transcripts, allowing Z-Scores to
expose systematic weaknesses that word-level metrics obscure. By providing
category-specific diagnostics, Z-Scores enable researchers to identify model
failure modes and design targeted interventions -- such as tailored prompts or
data augmentation -- yielding measurable performance improvements. A case study
with LLMs shows that Z-Scores uncover challenges with INTJ and PRN disfluencies
hidden in aggregate F1, directly informing model refinement strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRES is a controlled text-level benchmark for evaluating disfluency removal in speech systems, revealing key insights about LLM performance and providing practical deployment recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disfluencies degrade accuracy in speech-driven systems like command interpretation and conversational agents, creating a need for robust disfluency removal methods.

Method: Created DRES benchmark using human-annotated Switchboard transcripts to isolate disfluency removal from ASR errors. Systematically evaluated proprietary and open-source LLMs across scales, prompting strategies, and architectures.

Result: Found that simple segmentation improves performance, reasoning models over-delete fluent tokens, and fine-tuning achieves near state-of-the-art precision but harms generalization. Identified LLM-specific error modes.

Conclusion: DRES provides reproducible foundation for advancing spoken-language systems, with nine practical recommendations for deploying disfluency removal in speech pipelines.

Abstract: Disfluencies -- such as "um," "uh," interjections, parentheticals, and edited
statements -- remain a persistent challenge for speech-driven systems,
degrading accuracy in command interpretation, summarization, and conversational
agents. We introduce DRES (Disfluency Removal Evaluation Suite), a controlled
text-level benchmark that establishes a reproducible semantic upper bound for
this task. DRES builds on human-annotated Switchboard transcripts, isolating
disfluency removal from ASR errors and acoustic variability. We systematically
evaluate proprietary and open-source LLMs across scales, prompting strategies,
and architectures. Our results reveal that (i) simple segmentation consistently
improves performance, even for long-context models; (ii) reasoning-oriented
models tend to over-delete fluent tokens; and (iii) fine-tuning achieves near
state-of-the-art precision and recall but harms generalization abilities. We
further present a set of LLM-specific error modes and offer nine practical
recommendations (R1-R9) for deploying disfluency removal in speech-driven
pipelines. DRES provides a reproducible, model-agnostic foundation for
advancing robust spoken-language systems.

*Gebrearegawi Gebremariam,Hailay Teklehaymanot,Gebregewergs Mezgebe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Development of a rule-based morphological synthesizer for Ge'ez language that generates surface words from root words with 97.4% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ge'ez is a significant ancient Semitic language with complex morphology but lacks NLP tools due to scarcity of annotated data, corpora, and lexicons, despite its importance for Ethiopian and Eritrean cultural studies.

Method: Created a rule-based morphological synthesizer using 1,102 sample verbs representing all verb morphological structures to generate surface words from root words according to Ge'ez morphological patterns.

Result: The system achieved 97.4% performance, outperforming baseline models, demonstrating effectiveness in handling Ge'ez morphological complexity.

Conclusion: The successful rule-based approach suggests future work should build comprehensive systems considering morphological variations of Ge'ez language.

Abstract: Ge'ez is an ancient Semitic language renowned for its unique alphabet. It
serves as the script for numerous languages, including Tigrinya and Amharic,
and played a pivotal role in Ethiopia's cultural and religious development
during the Aksumite kingdom era. Ge'ez remains significant as a liturgical
language in Ethiopia and Eritrea, with much of the national identity
documentation recorded in Ge'ez. These written materials are invaluable primary
sources for studying Ethiopian and Eritrean philosophy, creativity, knowledge,
and civilization. Ge'ez has a complex morphological structure with rich
inflectional and derivational morphology, and no usable NLP has been developed
and published until now due to the scarcity of annotated linguistic data,
corpora, labeled datasets, and lexicons. Therefore, we propose a rule-based
Ge'ez morphological synthesizer to generate surface words from root words
according to the morphological structures of the language. We used 1,102 sample
verbs, representing all verb morphological structures, to test and evaluate the
system. The system achieves a performance of 97.4%, outperforming the baseline
model and suggesting that future work should build a comprehensive system
considering morphological variations of the language.

TL;DR: EmbeddingGemma is a new lightweight, open text embedding model based on Gemma 3 that achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 300M parameters through innovative training techniques including encoder-decoder initialization, geometric embedding distillation, and spread-out regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a highly efficient text embedding model that outperforms larger models while being suitable for low-latency, high-throughput applications like on-device use cases, addressing the need for cost-effective embedding solutions.

Method: Uses encoder-decoder initialization and geometric embedding distillation to capture knowledge from larger models, incorporates spread-out regularizer for robustness, and merges checkpoints from optimized mixtures for generalizability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on MTEB across multilingual, English, and code domains, outperforming prior top models with <500M parameters and providing performance comparable to models double its size, even when quantized or truncated.

Conclusion: EmbeddingGemma offers exceptional performance-to-cost ratio, making it ideal for practical applications, and is released to the community to promote further research.

Abstract: We introduce EmbeddingGemma, a new lightweight, open text embedding model
based on the Gemma 3 language model family. Our innovative training recipe
strategically captures knowledge from larger models via encoder-decoder
initialization and geometric embedding distillation. We improve model
robustness and expressiveness with a spread-out regularizer, and ensure
generalizability by merging checkpoints from varied, optimized mixtures.
Evaluated on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) across multilingual,
English, and code domains, EmbeddingGemma (300M) achieves state-of-the-art
results. Notably, it outperforms prior top models, both proprietary and open,
with fewer than 500M parameters, and provides performance comparable to models
double its size, offering an exceptional performance-to-cost ratio. Remarkably,
this lead persists when quantizing model weights or truncating embedding
outputs. This makes EmbeddingGemma particularly well-suited for low-latency and
high-throughput use cases such as on-device applications. We provide ablation
studies exploring our key design choices. We release EmbeddingGemma to the
community to promote further research.

### [158] [Language Models that Think, Chat Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20357)
*Adithya Bhaskar,Xi Ye,Danqi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLMT (Reinforcement Learning with Model-rewarded Thinking) extends RLVR to open-ended tasks by optimizing language models to generate CoT reasoning before responses using preference-based rewards, achieving superior performance over standard RLHF pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR's limited generalization for open-ended tasks like essay writing and meal planning motivates the development of RLMT to apply verifiable reward principles more broadly.

Method: RLMT requires LMs to generate long chain-of-thought reasoning before responses and optimizes them with online RL against preference-based reward models, tested across multiple models and optimization algorithms.

Result: RLMT consistently outperforms standard RLHF, with 3-7 point gains on chat benchmarks and 1-3 point improvements on creative writing and general knowledge tasks, even enabling base models to surpass instruction-tuned models.

Conclusion: RLMT rethinks post-training pipelines and demonstrates the importance of incorporating thinking processes more broadly in language model optimization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves language model
reasoning by using rule-based rewards in verifiable domains such as mathematics
and code. However, RLVR leads to limited generalization for open-ended tasks --
such as writing outline essays or making meal plans -- where humans reason
routinely. This paper shows that the RLVR paradigm is effective beyond
verifiable domains, and introduces **RL** with **M**odel-rewarded **T**hinking
(**RLMT**) for general-purpose chat capabilities. Using diverse real-world
prompts, RLMT requires LMs to generate long CoT reasoning before response, and
optimizes them with online RL against a preference-based reward model used in
RLHF. Across 40 training runs on Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B (both base and
instruct) and multiple optimization algorithms (DPO, PPO, and GRPO), RLMT
consistently outperforms standard RLHF pipelines. This includes substantial
gains of 3-7 points on three chat benchmarks (AlpacaEval2, WildBench, and
ArenaHardV2), along with 1-3 point improvements on other tasks like creative
writing and general knowledge. Our best 8B model surpasses GPT-4o in chat and
creative writing and rivals Claude-3.7-Sonnet (Thinking). RLMT can also be
applied directly to base models without an SFT stage, akin to R1-Zero training.
Remarkably, with only 7K prompts, Llama-3.1-8B base trained with our RLMT
recipe outperforms Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct post-trained with a complex
multi-staged pipeline with 25M+ examples. We close with qualitative and
quantitative analyses of how trained models plan their responses. Our results
rethink the post-training pipeline and call upon future work to understand and
employ thinking more broadly.

TL;DR: User simulation is a critical catalyst for overcoming AGI bottlenecks by providing scalable evaluation environments and generating interaction data for training adaptive agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AGI development faces bottlenecks in evaluating complex interactive systems and acquiring sufficient interaction data for training. User simulation addresses these fundamental challenges.

Method: Proposes using computational agents that mimic human interaction with AI systems to create realistic simulators for evaluation and data generation.

Result: Identifies that user simulation and intelligent task agents are deeply synergistic and must advance together to accelerate AGI development.

Conclusion: Research into user simulation technology is essential for AGI progress, requiring interdisciplinary collaboration and addressing challenges including those from large language models.

Abstract: Progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) faces significant
bottlenecks, particularly in rigorously evaluating complex interactive systems
and acquiring the vast interaction data needed for training adaptive agents.
This paper posits that user simulation -- creating computational agents that
mimic human interaction with AI systems -- is not merely a useful tool, but is
a critical catalyst required to overcome these bottlenecks and accelerate AGI
development. We argue that realistic simulators provide the necessary
environments for scalable evaluation, data generation for interactive learning,
and fostering the adaptive capabilities central to AGI. Therefore, research
into user simulation technology and intelligent task agents are deeply
synergistic and must advance hand-in-hand. This article elaborates on the
critical role of user simulation for AGI, explores the interdisciplinary nature
of building realistic simulators, identifies key challenges including those
posed by large language models, and proposes a future research agenda.

*Shripad Vilasrao Deshmukh,Will Schwarzer,Scott Niekum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvA-RL is a new reinforcement learning paradigm that trains policies to be both high-performing and easy to evaluate, addressing the tradeoff between policy performance and evaluation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL methods suffer from high variance or bias in policy evaluation due to limited data, long-horizon tasks, and environmental model inaccuracies. Evaluation is treated as an afterthought rather than a core design principle.

Method: Proposes evaluation-aware RL (EvA-RL) where policies are trained to maximize expected return while minimizing evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme. Extends to co-learn assessment-conditioned state-value predictors alongside policies.

Result: Empirical results across discrete and continuous action domains show EvA-RL substantially reduces evaluation error while maintaining competitive returns, though there's often a tradeoff between evaluation accuracy and policy performance.

Conclusion: EvA-RL establishes a foundation for RL methods that treat reliable evaluation as a first-class principle during training, enabling accurate policy evaluation with limited assessment data.

Abstract: Policy evaluation is often a prerequisite for deploying safety- and
performance-critical systems. Existing evaluation approaches frequently suffer
from high variance due to limited data and long-horizon tasks, or high bias due
to unequal support or inaccurate environmental models. We posit that these
challenges arise, in part, from the standard reinforcement learning (RL)
paradigm of policy learning without explicit consideration of evaluation. As an
alternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in
which a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously
minimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme --
in other words, being "easy" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL
and design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation,
conditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can
be different than the deployment environment. However, our theoretical analysis
and empirical results show that there is often a tradeoff between evaluation
accuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme
within EvA-RL. To mitigate this tradeoff, we extend our approach to co-learn an
assessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy. Empirical
results across diverse discrete and continuous action domains demonstrate that
EvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive
returns. This work lays the foundation for a broad new class of RL methods that
treat reliable evaluation as a first-class principle during training.

TL;DR: Analysis of self-consistency estimator for LLMs under fixed compute budget, favoring m,n ∝ √B split


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systems often repeat prompts to LLMs and aggregate responses to improve reliability, requiring analysis of optimal resource allocation

Method: Analyzes an estimator of LLM self-consistency and tradeoffs under fixed compute budget B=mn, where m is number of prompts and n is number of repeated calls per prompt

Result: The analysis shows that the optimal split favors m,n ∝ √B, meaning roughly equal allocation between sampling prompts and repeating calls per prompt

Conclusion: Under fixed compute budget, the optimal strategy for improving LLM reliability through repeated prompting is to balance the number of distinct prompts and repetitions per prompt proportionally to the square root of the total budget

Abstract: Systems often repeat the same prompt to large language models (LLMs) and
aggregate responses to improve reliability. This short note analyzes an
estimator of the self-consistency of LLMs and the tradeoffs it induces under a
fixed compute budget $B=mn$, where $m$ is the number of prompts sampled from
the task distribution and $n$ is the number of repeated LLM calls per prompt;
the resulting analysis favors a rough split $m,n\propto\sqrt{B}$.

### [162] [Cognitive Load Limits in Large Language Models: Benchmarking Multi-Hop Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19517)
*Sai Teja Reddy Adapala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theory of computational cognitive load in LLMs, showing that context saturation and attentional residue degrade reasoning performance, with smaller models failing completely while larger models show partial resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a gap between LLM performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic environments. The computational limits governing reasoning under cognitive load are poorly understood.

Method: Developed Interleaved Cognitive Evaluation (ICE) benchmark to systematically manipulate cognitive load factors (context saturation and attentional residue) on multi-hop reasoning tasks, testing 5 instruction-tuned models across 200 questions with 10 replications each.

Result: Smaller models (Llama-3-8B, Mistral-7B) achieved 0% accuracy across all conditions. Gemini-2.0-Flash showed 85% accuracy in controls but significant degradation under context saturation (β = -0.003 per % load, p < 0.001).

Conclusion: Cognitive load is a key contributor to reasoning failures, supporting hallucination-as-guessing theories. Dynamic cognitive-aware stress testing is essential for evaluating AI resilience and safety.

Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed a critical gap
between their performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic,
information-rich environments. While models excel at isolated tasks, the
computational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain
poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational
cognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context
Saturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key
mechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive
Evaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these
load factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N
= 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant
performance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller
open-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)
exhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all
conditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In
contrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85%
accuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation
under context saturation ($\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These
findings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor
to reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under
uncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as
exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true
resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.

*Ramy ElMallah,Krish Chhajer,Chi-Guhn Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepEval is a proposed evaluation framework that uses vision-language models to assess subgoal-level success rates in robot manipulation tasks, moving beyond single binary success metrics to provide more granular performance visibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot learning papers only report overall binary success rates, which obscures where policies succeed or fail in multi-step manipulation tasks. There's a need for more detailed subgoal-level evaluation to understand partial competence.

Method: StepEval uses vision-language models as automated judges to evaluate subgoal outcomes from recorded images/videos. It's designed as a cost-aware, model-agnostic framework that supports single- or multi-view inputs and can be adopted across labs.

Result: The framework enables per-subgoal success rate vectors as primary evaluation artifacts, along with other metrics like latency and cost estimates for framework optimization diagnostics when ground-truth labels are available.

Conclusion: StepEval provides a blueprint for a community-driven open-source project that can make subgoal-level evaluation standard and reproducible practice in robot learning research.

Abstract: Robot learning papers typically report a single binary success rate (SR),
which obscures where a policy succeeds or fails along a multi-step manipulation
task. We argue that subgoal-level reporting should become routine: for each
trajectory, a vector of per-subgoal SRs that makes partial competence visible
(e.g., grasp vs. pour). We propose a blueprint for StepEval, a cost-aware
plug-in evaluation framework that utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) as
automated judges of subgoal outcomes from recorded images or videos. Rather
than proposing new benchmarks or APIs, our contribution is to outline design
principles for a scalable, community-driven open-source project. In StepEval,
the primary artifact for policy evaluation is the per-subgoal SR vector;
however, other quantities (e.g., latency or cost estimates) are also considered
for framework-optimization diagnostics to help the community tune evaluation
efficiency and accuracy when ground-truth subgoal success labels are available.
We discuss how such a framework can remain model-agnostic, support single- or
multi-view inputs, and be lightweight enough to adopt across labs. The intended
contribution is a shared direction: a minimal, extensible seed that invites
open-source contributions, so that scoring the steps, not just the final goal,
becomes a standard and reproducible practice.

Motivation: To address hallucination problems and high computational costs associated with using large language models for genomics question answering.

Method: Developed Nano Bio-Agent (NBA) framework incorporating task decomposition, tool orchestration, and API access to systems like NCBI and AlphaGenome for SLMs.

Result: Best model-agent combination achieved 98% accuracy on GeneTuring benchmark, with 3-10B parameter models consistently achieving 85-97% accuracy using significantly lower computational resources.

Conclusion: SLMs with agentic frameworks show promising potential for efficient, cost-effective democratization of ML-powered genomics tools while maintaining robust performance.

Abstract: We investigate the application of Small Language Models (<10 billion
parameters) for genomics question answering via agentic framework to address
hallucination issues and computational cost challenges. The Nano Bio-Agent
(NBA) framework we implemented incorporates task decomposition, tool
orchestration, and API access into well-established systems such as NCBI and
AlphaGenome. Results show that SLMs combined with such agentic framework can
achieve comparable and in many cases superior performance versus existing
approaches utilising larger models, with our best model-agent combination
achieving 98% accuracy on the GeneTuring benchmark. Notably, small 3-10B
parameter models consistently achieve 85-97% accuracy while requiring much
lower computational resources than conventional approaches. This demonstrates
promising potential for efficiency gains, cost savings, and democratization of
ML-powered genomics tools while retaining highly robust and accurate
performance.

### [165] [What Does Your Benchmark Really Measure? A Framework for Robust Inference of AI Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19590)
*Nathanael Jo,Ashia Wilson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a principled framework for AI evaluation as inference, addressing reliability issues in benchmark assessments by modeling capability and accounting for uncertainty from sensitivity and finite samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI evaluations are treated as simple measurements but are actually inferences that assume theories of capability. There's growing skepticism about their reliability, particularly regarding sensitivity to perturbations and whether reported accuracy genuinely reflects true performance.

Method: The authors propose evaluation as inference: starting from a theory of capability and deriving estimation methods. They formulate a model of ability and introduce methods that infer ability while accounting for uncertainty from sensitivity and finite samples, including an adaptive algorithm that reduces sample complexity.

Result: The framework provides more reliable estimates of AI capabilities by explicitly modeling the inference process and addressing sensitivity issues that undermine current evaluation reliability.

Conclusion: This perspective, familiar in psychometrics but not yet common in AI evaluation, lays groundwork for more trustworthy benchmark assessments by making explicit the theoretical assumptions underlying capability measurement.

Abstract: Evaluations of generative models on benchmark data are now ubiquitous, and
their outcomes critically shape public and scientific expectations of AI's
capabilities. Yet growing skepticism surrounds their reliability. How can we
know that a reported accuracy genuinely reflects a model's true performance?
Evaluations are often presented as simple measurements, but in reality they are
inferences: to treat benchmark scores as evidence of capability is already to
assume a theory of what capability is and how it manifests in a test. We make
this step explicit by proposing a principled framework for evaluation as
inference: begin from a theory of capability, and then derive methods for
estimating it. This perspective, familiar in fields such as psychometrics, has
not yet become commonplace in AI evaluation. As a proof of concept, we address
a central challenge that undermines reliability: sensitivity to perturbations.
After formulating a model of ability, we introduce methods that infer ability
while accounting for uncertainty from sensitivity and finite samples, including
an adaptive algorithm that significantly reduces sample complexity. Together,
these contributions lay the groundwork for more reliable and trustworthy
estimates of AI capabilities as measured through benchmarks.

TL;DR: SteinerSQL is a framework that unifies mathematical reasoning and schema navigation for complex Text-to-SQL queries by formulating them as a graph-centric optimization problem using Steiner trees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-SQL methods handle mathematical reasoning and schema navigation separately, creating fractured reasoning processes that compromise logical and structural correctness.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Mathematical decomposition to identify required tables (terminals), 2) Optimal reasoning scaffold construction via Steiner tree problem, 3) Multi-level validation to ensure correctness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 36.10% execution accuracy on LogicCat and 40.04% on Spider2.0-Lite benchmarks using Gemini-2.5-Pro.

Conclusion: SteinerSQL presents a unified paradigm for Text-to-SQL that enables more robust and principled solutions to complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex Text-to-SQL queries that
demand both sophisticated mathematical reasoning and intricate schema
navigation. Existing methods often tackle these challenges in isolation,
creating a fractured reasoning process that compromises logical and structural
correctness. To resolve this, we introduce SteinerSQL, a framework that unifies
these dual challenges into a single, graph-centric optimization problem.
SteinerSQL operates in three stages: mathematical decomposition to identify
required tables (terminals), optimal reasoning scaffold construction via a
Steiner tree problem, and multi-level validation to ensure correctness. On the
challenging LogicCat and Spider2.0-Lite benchmarks, SteinerSQL establishes a
new state-of-the-art with 36.10% and 40.04% execution accuracy, respectively,
using Gemini-2.5-Pro. Beyond accuracy, SteinerSQL presents a new, unified
paradigm for Text-to-SQL, paving the way for more robust and principled
solutions to complex reasoning tasks.

Motivation: Advanced test-time computing strategies are limited by poor self-evaluation capabilities of reasoning models, which caps their effectiveness.

Method: Develop a pairwise Explanatory Verifier trained via reinforcement learning (GRPO) that generates calibrated confidence scores and associated natural language reasoning for solutions.

Result: The verifier improves accuracy and efficiency of test-time strategies like best-of-n and self-reflection, and excels at identifying challenging failure modes where standard methods fail.

Conclusion: The proposed Explanatory Verifier effectively addresses self-evaluation limitations in reasoning models, enabling more robust test-time computing strategies.

Abstract: Advanced test-time computing strategies are essential for scaling reasoning
models, but their effectiveness is capped by the models' poor self-evaluation.
We propose a pairwise Explanatory Verifier, trained via reinforcement learning
(GRPO), that produces calibrated confidence scores and associated natural
language reasoning for generated solutions. Our verifier improves the accuracy

TL;DR: UserRL is a framework for training and evaluating user-centric AI agents through standardized gym environments with simulated users, focusing on reward shaping and trajectory scoring to improve multi-turn interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL shows promise for dynamic agentic models, but their real value depends on assisting users effectively, which is challenged by the diversity and dynamics of user interactions.

Method: Proposes UserRL framework with standardized gym environments and simulated users, systematically varying turn-level rewards and trajectory-level scores using GRPO algorithm across Qwen3 models.

Result: Key findings: SFT cold start is critical for initial interaction ability; deliberate trajectory scoring improves multi-turn interactions; open-source simulators like Qwen3-32B are cost-effective alternatives to stronger simulated users like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Careful design of reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, establishing UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric agentic models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training agentic models that
move beyond static benchmarks to engage in dynamic, multi-turn interactions.
Yet, the ultimate value of such agents lies in their ability to assist users, a
setting where diversity and dynamics of user interaction pose challenges. In
this work, we propose UserRL, a unified framework for training and evaluating
user-centric abilities through standardized gym environments paired with
simulated users. We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and
trajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect
learning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal
three key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial
interaction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate
trajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions;
and (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training,
open-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and
transferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of
reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and
establish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric
agentic models. All codes and data are public for future research.

Abstract: Modern LLM reasoning relies on extensive test-time computation, driven by
internal model training and external agentic orchestration. However, this
synergy is often inefficient, as model verbosity and poor instruction following
lead to wasted compute. We analyze this capability-cost trade-off and introduce
an optimized reasoning workflow (\cepo) that empowers smaller open-source
models to outperform models multiple times their size. We will open-source this
workflow to enable further research. Our work demonstrates a clear path toward
co-designing orchestration frameworks with the underlying model capabilities to
unlock powerful reasoning in small-to-medium sized models.

### [170] [Agentic Metacognition: Designing a "Self-Aware" Low-Code Agent for Failure Prediction and Human Handoff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19783)
*Jiexi Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A metacognitive layer for monitoring LCNC agents that predicts failures and initiates human handoffs to improve reliability and trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reliability challenges in autonomous agents within LCNC environments, where non-deterministic behavior leads to loops, inaccurate outputs, and failures that frustrate users and break trust.

Method: Integration of a secondary metacognitive layer that monitors primary LCNC agents, predicts impending failures based on triggers like excessive latency or repetitive actions, and proactively initiates human handoffs with explanations.

Result: Empirical analysis shows significant increase in overall task success rate, though with notable computational overhead. Human handoffs are reframed as a design feature that enhances resilience and trust.

Conclusion: The approach improves system resilience and user experience by providing transparency into agent states. The report discusses practical/ethical implications and identifies future research directions.

Abstract: The inherent non-deterministic nature of autonomous agents, particularly
within low-code/no-code (LCNC) environments, presents significant reliability
challenges. Agents can become trapped in unforeseen loops, generate inaccurate
outputs, or encounter unrecoverable failures, leading to user frustration and a
breakdown of trust. This report proposes a novel architectural pattern to
address these issues: the integration of a secondary, "metacognitive" layer
that actively monitors the primary LCNC agent. Inspired by human introspection,
this layer is designed to predict impending task failures based on a defined
set of triggers, such as excessive latency or repetitive actions. Upon
predicting a failure, the metacognitive agent proactively initiates a human
handoff, providing the user with a clear summary of the agent's "thought
process" and a detailed explanation of why it could not proceed. An empirical
analysis of a prototype system demonstrates that this approach significantly
increases the overall task success rate. However, this performance gain comes
with a notable increase in computational overhead. The findings reframe human
handoffs not as an admission of defeat but as a core design feature that
enhances system resilience, improves user experience, and builds trust by
providing transparency into the agent's internal state. The report discusses
the practical and ethical implications of this approach and identifies key
directions for future research.

*Donghwan Lee,Hyukjun Yang,Bum Geun Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper establishes a theoretical foundation for solving LP-based MDPs using log-barrier functions to transform inequality-constrained optimization into unconstrained gradient descent problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LP-based methods for MDPs have been underused due to the difficulty of solving inequality-constrained optimization problems compared to Bellman-equation-based methods, despite recent attention in offline RL contexts.

Method: The paper leverages log-barrier functions to transform the LP formulation of MDPs into an unconstrained optimization problem, enabling approximate solutions via gradient descent.

Result: The method provides a practical approach to solving LP-based MDPs, though a thorough theoretical interpretation of this approach has not been previously developed.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap by establishing the theoretical foundation for using log-barrier functions to effectively solve LP-based MDP optimization problems.

Abstract: There are two primary approaches to solving Markov decision problems (MDPs):
dynamic programming based on the Bellman equation and linear programming (LP).
Dynamic programming methods are the most widely used and form the foundation of
both classical and modern reinforcement learning (RL). By contrast, LP-based
methods have been less commonly employed, although they have recently gained
attention in contexts such as offline RL. The relative underuse of the LP-based
methods stems from the fact that it leads to an inequality-constrained
optimization problem, which is generally more challenging to solve effectively
compared with Bellman-equation-based methods. The purpose of this paper is to
establish a theoretical foundation for solving LP-based MDPs in a more
effective and practical manner. Our key idea is to leverage the log-barrier
function, widely used in inequality-constrained optimization, to transform the
LP formulation of the MDP into an unconstrained optimization problem. This
reformulation enables approximate solutions to be obtained easily via gradient
descent. While the method may appear simple, to the best of our knowledge, a
thorough theoretical interpretation of this approach has not yet been
developed. This paper aims to bridge this gap.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LATENTGUARD is a three-stage framework combining behavioral alignment with supervised latent space control for interpretable safety steering in LLMs, achieving selective refusal behavior while preserving utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle to balance comprehensive safety with fine-grained controllability at the representation level in large language models.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Fine-tune LLM on rationalized datasets with reasoning-enhanced refusal/normal responses; 2) Train structured VAE on MLP activations supervised by multi-label annotations; 3) Targeted manipulation of learned latent dimensions for selective refusal behavior.

Result: Experiments on Qwen3-8B show significant improvements in safety controllability and response interpretability without compromising utility. Cross-architecture validation on Mistral-7B confirms generalizability.

Conclusion: Structured representation-level intervention offers a promising pathway toward building safer yet practical LLM systems.

Abstract: Achieving robust safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) while
preserving their utility remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches
often struggle to balance comprehensive safety with fine-grained
controllability at the representation level. We introduce LATENTGUARD, a novel
three-stage framework that combines behavioral alignment with supervised latent
space control for interpretable and precise safety steering. Our approach
begins by fine-tuning an LLM on rationalized datasets containing both
reasoning-enhanced refusal responses to adversarial prompts and
reasoning-enhanced normal responses to benign queries, establishing robust
behavioral priors across both safety-critical and utility-preserving scenarios.
We then train a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) on intermediate MLP
activations, supervised by multi-label annotations including attack types,
attack methods, and benign indicators. This supervision enables the VAE to
learn disentangled latent representations that capture distinct adversarial
characteristics while maintaining semantic interpretability. Through targeted
manipulation of learned latent dimensions, LATENTGUARD achieves selective
refusal behavior, effectively blocking harmful requests while preserving
helpfulness for legitimate use cases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate
significant improvements in both safety controllability and response
interpretability without compromising utility. Cross-architecture validation on
Mistral-7B confirms the generalizability of our latent steering approach,
showing consistent effectiveness across different model families. Our results
suggest that structured representation-level intervention offers a promising
pathway toward building safer yet practical LLM systems.

TL;DR: CON-QA is a hybrid privacy-preserving framework for secure question answering over enterprise contracts, combining local and cloud-hosted LLMs to protect sensitive information while maintaining utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting sensitive contractual information (PII and commercially sensitive clauses) when enterprises use cloud-based LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini for legal document workflows.

Method: Three-stage framework: (1) semantic query decomposition and query-aware document chunk retrieval using local LLM, (2) anonymization of sensitive entities via structured one-to-many mapping, (3) anonymized response generation by cloud LLM with local reconstruction using reverse mapping.

Result: Empirical evaluations using CUAD-QA corpus (85k QA pairs over 510 contracts) show CON-QA effectively maintains privacy and utility, preserves answer quality, maintains legal clause semantics fidelity, and significantly mitigates privacy risks.

Conclusion: CON-QA demonstrates practical suitability for secure, enterprise-level contract document processing by effectively balancing privacy protection with functional utility.

Abstract: As enterprises increasingly integrate cloud-based large language models
(LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini into their legal document workflows,
protecting sensitive contractual information - including Personally
Identifiable Information (PII) and commercially sensitive clauses - has emerged
as a critical challenge. In this work, we propose CON-QA, a hybrid
privacy-preserving framework designed specifically for secure question
answering over enterprise contracts, effectively combining local and
cloud-hosted LLMs. The CON-QA framework operates through three stages: (i)
semantic query decomposition and query-aware document chunk retrieval using a
locally deployed LLM analysis, (ii) anonymization of detected sensitive
entities via a structured one-to-many mapping scheme, ensuring semantic
coherence while preventing cross-session entity inference attacks, and (iii)
anonymized response generation by a cloud-based LLM, with accurate
reconstruction of the original answer locally using a session-consistent
many-to-one reverse mapping. To rigorously evaluate CON-QA, we introduce
CUAD-QA, a corpus of 85k question-answer pairs generated over 510 real-world
CUAD contract documents, encompassing simple, complex, and summarization-style
queries. Empirical evaluations, complemented by detailed human assessments,
confirm that CON-QA effectively maintains both privacy and utility, preserves
answer quality, maintains fidelity to legal clause semantics, and significantly
mitigates privacy risks, demonstrating its practical suitability for secure,
enterprise-level contract documents.

The joint MLLM-WM architecture shows significant potential, and the paper outlines future research directions for further advancing embodied AI applications in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for
achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for
various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical
systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models
(WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs
empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing
high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions
into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building
internal representations and future predictions of the external world,
facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper
comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances,
covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present
the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied
AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal
angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e.,
embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs,
meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied
cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the
above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint
MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound
significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we
examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide
applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MACD framework enables LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge through multi-agent collaboration, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy and achieving performance comparable to or exceeding human physicians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches in medical diagnosis optimize isolated inferences but neglect the accumulation of reusable clinical experience that physicians develop through practice.

Method: Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD) framework with a pipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights through iterative consultations among LLM-based diagnostician agents, supported by an evaluator agent and human oversight.

Result: Evaluated on 4,390 real-world cases across 7 diseases, MACD improved primary diagnostic accuracy by up to 22.3% over clinical guidelines and achieved up to 16% improvement over physicians-only diagnosis. MACD-human workflow showed 18.6% improvement over physicians-only diagnosis.

Conclusion: MACD presents a scalable self-learning paradigm that bridges the gap between LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and real-world clinical practice, with strong cross-model stability, transferability, and explainable rationales.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable potential in medical
applications, yet they face substantial challenges in handling complex
real-world clinical diagnoses using conventional prompting methods. Current
prompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated
inferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To
address this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD)
framework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent
pipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors
how physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and
accurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a
MACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician
agents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and
human oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390
real-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs
(Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves
primary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with
gains up to 22.3% (MACD). On the subset of the data, it achieves performance on
par with or exceeding that of human physicians (up to 16% improvement over
physicians-only diagnosis). Additionally, on the MACD-human workflow, it
achieves an 18.6% improvement compared to physicians-only diagnosis. Moreover,
self-learned knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability,
and model-specific personalization, while the system can generate traceable
rationales, enhancing explainability. Consequently, this work presents a
scalable self-learning paradigm for LLM-assisted diagnosis, bridging the gap
between the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs and real-world clinical practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge synthetic biology with swarm robotics by demonstrating that stigmergic systems inherently encode distributed reinforcement learning processes, advancing programmable living systems for resilient decision-making in volatile environments.

Method: Modeled engineered nematode swarms performing foraging tasks, showing pheromone dynamics mathematically mirror cross-learning updates (a fundamental RL algorithm). Validated with literature data and conducted computational experiments in multi-armed bandit scenarios.

Result: The model accurately replicates empirical C. elegans foraging patterns under static conditions. In dynamic environments, persistent pheromone trails create positive feedback loops that hinder adaptation, but introducing a minority of exploratory agents restores collective plasticity and enables rapid task switching.

Conclusion: Stigmergic systems inherently encode distributed RL processes where environmental signals act as external memory for collective credit assignment. Behavioral heterogeneity balances exploration-exploitation trade-offs, implementing swarm-level extinction of outdated strategies.

Abstract: Swarm intelligence emerges from decentralised interactions among simple
agents, enabling collective problem-solving. This study establishes a
theoretical equivalence between pheromone-mediated aggregation in \celeg\ and
reinforcement learning (RL), demonstrating how stigmergic signals function as
distributed reward mechanisms. We model engineered nematode swarms performing
foraging tasks, showing that pheromone dynamics mathematically mirror
cross-learning updates, a fundamental RL algorithm. Experimental validation
with data from literature confirms that our model accurately replicates
empirical \celeg\ foraging patterns under static conditions. In dynamic
environments, persistent pheromone trails create positive feedback loops that
hinder adaptation by locking swarms into obsolete choices. Through
computational experiments in multi-armed bandit scenarios, we reveal that
introducing a minority of exploratory agents insensitive to pheromones restores
collective plasticity, enabling rapid task switching. This behavioural
heterogeneity balances exploration-exploitation trade-offs, implementing
swarm-level extinction of outdated strategies. Our results demonstrate that
stigmergic systems inherently encode distributed RL processes, where
environmental signals act as external memory for collective credit assignment.
By bridging synthetic biology with swarm robotics, this work advances

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE is a steerable adversarial scenario generator that enables fine-grained control over the trade-off between adversariality and realism in autonomous driving scenario generation without retraining, using hierarchical preference optimization and weight interpolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial scenario generation methods are constrained to fixed trade-offs between objectives like adversariality and realism, lacking flexibility for diverse training and testing requirements. This creates behavior-specific models that cannot be steered at inference time.

Method: Proposes hierarchical group-based preference optimization to balance competing objectives by decoupling hard feasibility constraints from soft preferences. Fine-tunes two experts on opposing preferences and constructs a continuous spectrum of policies at inference time by linearly interpolating their weights, justified by linear mode connectivity theory.

Result: SAGE generates scenarios with superior balance of adversariality and realism compared to existing methods, and enables more effective closed-loop training of driving policies.

Conclusion: The framework successfully reframes adversarial scenario generation as a multi-objective preference alignment problem, providing flexible and efficient test-time control over scenario characteristics without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Adversarial scenario generation is a cost-effective approach for safety
assessment of autonomous driving systems. However, existing methods are often
constrained to a single, fixed trade-off between competing objectives such as
adversariality and realism. This yields behavior-specific models that cannot be
steered at inference time, lacking the efficiency and flexibility to generate
tailored scenarios for diverse training and testing requirements. In view of
this, we reframe the task of adversarial scenario generation as a
multi-objective preference alignment problem and introduce a new framework
named \textbf{S}teerable \textbf{A}dversarial scenario \textbf{GE}nerator
(SAGE). SAGE enables fine-grained test-time control over the trade-off between
adversariality and realism without any retraining. We first propose
hierarchical group-based preference optimization, a data-efficient offline
alignment method that learns to balance competing objectives by decoupling hard
feasibility constraints from soft preferences. Instead of training a fixed
model, SAGE fine-tunes two experts on opposing preferences and constructs a
continuous spectrum of policies at inference time by linearly interpolating
their weights. We provide theoretical justification for this framework through
the lens of linear mode connectivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SAGE not only generates scenarios with a superior balance of adversariality and
realism but also enables more effective closed-loop training of driving
policies. Project page: https://tongnie.github.io/SAGE/.

Method: Incorporates fidelity-based reward from Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) into Proximal Policy Optimization to guide learning through structural consistency rather than direct supervision or contrastive objectives.

Result: Significant improvements over supervised, contrastive, and pretrained baselines on GSM8K, StrategyQA, and EntailmentBank datasets across multiple coherence metrics.

Conclusion: Quantum-inspired fidelity provides an effective foundation to improve reasoning trace coherence in LLMs, offering a novel approach for enforcing global coherence.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with maintaining coherent
multi-step reasoning traces, particularly in tasks that require a structured
logical flow. This work introduces a quantum-inspired approach to address the
challenge by incorporating a fidelity-based reward derived from Projected
Entangled Pair States (PEPS) into Proximal Policy Optimization. Unlike prior
approaches that use direct supervision or contrastive objectives, the proposed
method guides learning through structural consistency, offering a novel
approach to enforce global coherence in generated reasoning traces. The
proposed framework is evaluated using multiple coherence-determining metrics on
diverse datasets such as GSM8K, StrategyQA, and EntailmentBank spanning
arithmetic, intuitive, and entailment-based reasoning. Results show that the
proposed quantum-inspired approach offers significant improvements over
supervised, contrastive, and pretrained baseline approaches, highlighting the
effectiveness of quantum-inspired fidelity as a foundation to improve reasoning

Motivation: To transform static multi-agent coordination into dynamic collaboration by making agent capabilities searchable and enabling efficient task matching and decomposition.

Method: Uses Versioned Capability Vectors (VCVs) for semantic capability matching, combines semantic routing with HNSW indices, dynamic task decomposition through consensus-based merging, and smart clustering for collaborative refinement.

Result: Achieves 13x improvements over single-model baselines on HealthBench, with particularly effective performance on complex reasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives.

Conclusion: Semantic orchestration with structured collaboration can unlock the collective intelligence of heterogeneous federations of AI agents while maintaining scalable performance.

Abstract: We present Federation of Agents (FoA), a distributed orchestration framework
that transforms static multi-agent coordination into dynamic, capability-driven
collaboration. FoA introduces Versioned Capability Vectors (VCVs):
machine-readable profiles that make agent capabilities searchable through
semantic embeddings, enabling agents to advertise their capabilities, cost, and
limitations. Our aarchitecturecombines three key innovations: (1) semantic
routing that matches tasks to agents over sharded HNSW indices while enforcing
operational constraints through cost-biased optimization, (2) dynamic task
decomposition where compatible agents collaboratively break down complex tasks
into DAGs of subtasks through consensus-based merging, and (3) smart clustering
that groups agents working on similar subtasks into collaborative channels for
k-round refinement before synthesis. Built on top of MQTT,s publish-subscribe
semantics for scalable message passing, FoA achieves sub-linear complexity
through hierarchical capability matching and efficient index maintenance.
Evaluation on HealthBench shows 13x improvements over single-model baselines,
with clustering-enhanced laboration particularly effective for complex
reasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives. The system scales horizontally
while maintaining consistent performance, demonstrating that semantic
orchestration with structured collaboration can unlock the collective

Result: The research identified various practical challenges including bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational constraints that significantly impacted system behavior.

Conclusion: By documenting real-world deployment experiences, this study provides valuable guidance for future implementations of similar lane-change prediction systems, emphasizing the importance of addressing practical constraints.

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained attention in the last few
years. Most existing works in this area have been conducted in simulation
environments or with pre-recorded datasets, these works often rely on
simplified assumptions about sensing, communication, and traffic behavior that
do not always hold in practice. Real-world deployments of lane-change
prediction systems are relatively rare, and when they are reported, the
practical challenges, limitations, and lessons learned are often
under-documented. This study explores cooperative lane-change prediction
through a real hardware deployment in mixed traffic and shares the insights
that emerged during implementation and testing. We highlight the practical
challenges we faced, including bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational
constraints that shaped the behavior of the system. By documenting these

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM-based agent framework is proposed to assist with CT scan protocol management by interpreting natural language requests and generating device-compatible protocol files, showing feasibility but facing limitations due to lack of unified device APIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT scan protocol management is time-consuming and requires expertise, while there's an increasing shortage of skilled workforce in radiology. The paper aims to improve workflow efficiency and reduce technologists' workload.

Method: The framework combines in-context-learning, instruction-following, and structured tool-calling abilities to identify relevant protocol elements and apply modifications. It processes natural language or structured format requests.

Result: Experimental results show the agent can effectively retrieve protocol components, generate device-compatible protocol definition files, and faithfully implement user requests.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates feasibility for LLM-based agents in CT scan protocol management but faces limitations regarding syntactic/semantic validity due to lack of unified device APIs and challenges with ambiguous/complex requests.

Abstract: Managing scan protocols in Computed Tomography (CT), which includes adjusting
acquisition parameters or configuring reconstructions, as well as selecting
postprocessing tools in a patient-specific manner, is time-consuming and
requires clinical as well as technical expertise. At the same time, we observe
an increasing shortage of skilled workforce in radiology. To address this
issue, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent framework is proposed to assist
with the interpretation and execution of protocol configuration requests given
in natural language or a structured, device-independent format, aiming to
improve the workflow efficiency and reduce technologists' workload. The agent
combines in-context-learning, instruction-following, and structured toolcalling
abilities to identify relevant protocol elements and apply accurate
modifications. In a systematic evaluation, experimental results indicate that
the agent can effectively retrieve protocol components, generate device
compatible protocol definition files, and faithfully implement user requests.
Despite demonstrating feasibility in principle, the approach faces limitations
regarding syntactic and semantic validity due to lack of a unified device API,
and challenges with ambiguous or complex requests. In summary, the findings
show a clear path towards LLM-based agents for supporting scan protocol
management in CT imaging.
