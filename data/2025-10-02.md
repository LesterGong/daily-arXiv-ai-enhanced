### [1] [Hybrid Deep Learning for Hyperspectral Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00033)
*Usman Muhammad,Jorma Laaksonen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSUF module enhances hyperspectral image super-resolution by combining spectral unmixing with spatial-spectral feature extraction, using a custom loss function to improve both spatial details and spectral fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral SISR is challenging due to difficulty restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral fidelity across wavelengths, limiting conventional deep learning models.

Method: Proposed Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF) module integrated into 2D CNNs, combining spectral unmixing with spectral-spatial feature extraction, and a custom Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function.

Result: Experiments on three public remote sensing datasets show competitive performance while reducing model complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid deep learning model effectively addresses hyperspectral SISR challenges with improved reconstruction quality and reduced complexity.

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

### [2] [Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034)
*Zhengyi Ho,Siyuan Liang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified framework to characterize hallucinations in large language and vision models, linking them to specific mechanisms in the model lifecycle and identifying patterns in data distributions and biases as root causes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in AI models produce incorrect outputs that spread misinformation, causing financial and operational harm. Current understanding is fragmented, leading to solutions that address symptoms rather than underlying causes.

Method: Developed a unified multi-level framework for characterizing hallucinations across image and text modalities, using a task-modality interleaved approach to link hallucinations to specific mechanisms in model lifecycle.

Result: Investigations revealed that hallucinations often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited biases, providing insights into root causes rather than surface symptoms.

Conclusion: The survey establishes a foundation for developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world generative AI systems by providing a coherent understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

### [3] [On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037)
*Jianing Guo,Zhenhong Wu,Chang Tu,Yiyao Ma,Xiangqi Kong,Zhiqian Liu,Jiaming Ji,Shuning Zhang,Yuanpei Chen,Kai Chen,Xianglong Liu,Qi Dou,Yaodong Yang,Huijie Zhao,Weifeng Lv,Simin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobustVLA improves Vision-Language-Action model robustness against multi-modal perturbations through offline robust optimization and input consistency, achieving significant performance gains across 17 perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models focus only on visual perturbations but real-world deployment requires robustness across multiple modalities including actions, instructions, environments, and observations.

Method: Proposed RobustVLA with: 1) Offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise using flow matching objective, 2) Input consistency enforcement across variations preserving task semantics, 3) Multi-armed bandit formulation with UCB algorithm to identify harmful perturbations.

Result: Achieved 12.6% gain on pi0 backbone and 10.4% on OpenVLA across 17 perturbations, 50.6x faster inference than visual-robust VLAs, 65.6% gain on real-world FR5 robot with limited demonstrations.

Conclusion: RobustVLA effectively addresses multi-modal robustness in VLAs, demonstrating superior performance across diverse perturbations and real-world robot deployment scenarios.

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

### [4] [Uncovering Intrinsic Capabilities: A Paradigm for Data Curation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00040)
*Junjie Li,Ziao Wang,Jianghong Ma,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADC is a framework that curates instruction tuning data by analyzing intrinsic capabilities through gradient-based learning trajectories and influence estimation, achieving better performance with only 5% of data than full-data training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction tuning methods treat models as black boxes and often cause regressions when reducing dataset size, overlooking the latent capabilities that govern learning.

Method: Unsupervised discovery of intrinsic capabilities from gradient-based learning trajectories, attribute training data to capabilities via influence estimation, and curate capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.

Result: With only 5% of original data, CADC surpasses full-data training performance on multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: Intrinsic capabilities are fundamental building blocks of model learning, and CADC establishes a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

### [5] [Culture In a Frame: C$^3$B as a Comic-Based Benchmark for Multimodal Culturally Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00041)
*Yuchen Song,Andong Chen,Wenxin Zhu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Muyun Yang,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C³B is a multicultural, multitask, multilingual cultural awareness benchmark with 2000+ images and 18000+ QA pairs across three progressively difficult tasks, revealing significant performance gaps between current MLLMs and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cultural awareness benchmarks lack progressed difficulty in task design, are deficient in cross-lingual tasks, and use real-world images that typically contain only one culture, making them relatively easy for MLLMs.

Method: Proposed C³B benchmark constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties: from basic visual recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to cultural content generation, using comics images to present multiple cultures.

Result: Evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs revealed significant performance gaps between MLLMs and human performance, demonstrating that C³B poses substantial challenges for current models.

Conclusion: The benchmark encourages future research to advance cultural awareness capabilities of MLLMs, as current models struggle with the multicultural, multitask, and multilingual challenges presented by C³B.

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

### [6] [Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045)
*Franck Vandewiele,Remi Synave,Samuel Delepoulle,Remi Cozot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of gender bias in 6 text-to-image models reveals systematic occupational stereotypes, with nurses depicted exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men, varying by model and prompt wording.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how text-to-image models embed and amplify social biases in gender representation across hospital professions, given their increasing use in professional and creative contexts.

Method: Generated 100 images for each combination of 5 hospital professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse, paramedic, surgeon) and 5 portrait qualifiers using 6 state-of-the-art open-weight models, then analyzed gender representation patterns.

Result: All models showed systematic stereotypes: nurses exclusively female, surgeons predominantly male. Model-specific variations: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforced rigid male dominance, FLUX.1-dev skewed female, while others showed mixed outcomes. Prompt qualifiers significantly influenced gender balance.

Conclusion: Gender bias in TTI models is both systematic and model-specific, with prompt wording playing a critical role. Need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance to prevent reinforcement of occupational stereotypes.

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

### [7] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Template Stealing for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00046)
*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLStealer is a reinforcement learning framework that can steal prompt templates from MLLMs using only a few example images, exposing security risks in prompt trading markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt trading markets for MLLMs create security vulnerabilities where valuable prompts can be stolen, posing risks to commercial prompt trading.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning to treat template stealing as sequential decision making, employing similarity-based feedback signals as rewards to explore prompt space efficiently.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing attack cost to under 13% of existing baselines, and generalizes effectively across different image styles.

Conclusion: Highlights urgent security threats in prompt trading and lays groundwork for developing protective standards in MLLM marketplaces.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

### [8] [Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing for Faithfulness in Vision-Language Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00047)
*Sihao Ding,Santosh Vasa,Aditi Ramadwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDCT is an automated method to test if Vision-Language Models' explanations actually match what drives their predictions, by generating counterfactual image edits and checking consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often produce convincing but unfaithful explanations that don't reflect true causal factors, creating technical and governance risks.

Method: EDCT automatically: (1) gets model's answer and explanation, (2) parses explanation into testable concepts, (3) generates counterfactual edits via inpainting, (4) computes Counterfactual Consistency Score using LLM-assisted analysis.

Result: Testing 120 OK-VQA examples across multiple VLMs revealed substantial faithfulness gaps, showing explanations often fail causal tests.

Conclusion: EDCT provides regulator-aligned audit artifacts to verify when cited concepts in explanations are not actually causal factors.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

### [9] [HiDe: Rethinking The Zoom-IN method in High Resolution MLLMs via Hierarchical Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00054)
*Xianjie Liu,Yiman Hu,Yixiong Zou,Liang Wu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiDe is a training-free framework that addresses MLLMs' poor performance on high-resolution images by decoupling key information from background interference through attention-based token alignment and layout-preserving reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs perform poorly on high-resolution images, with existing approaches incorrectly attributing this to object size limitations rather than the actual cause: complex background interference.

Method: HiDe uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to identify key information tokens and align them with target visual regions, then Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to extract regions from background while preserving spatial layouts.

Result: HiDe achieves new SOTA on V*Bench (92.1% for Qwen2.5-VL 7B, 91.6% for InternVL3 8B), HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, surpassing RL methods while using 75% less memory than previous training-free approaches.

Conclusion: The main limitation of MLLMs on high-resolution images is background interference, not object size, and HiDe effectively addresses this through hierarchical decoupling without requiring training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

### [10] [FSDENet: A Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00059)
*Jiahao Fu,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSDENet is a dual-domain network that combines spatial and frequency processing to enhance remote sensing image segmentation, particularly addressing edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations like shadows and low-contrast regions.

Method: Uses spatial processing for multi-scale features, Fast Fourier Transform for global frequency information, and Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high/low-frequency components for boundary refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets: LoveDA, Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

Conclusion: FSDENet's dual-domain synergy between spatial granularity and frequency-domain edge sensitivity significantly improves segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition zones.

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

*Sheng Yang,Tong Zhan,Guancheng Chen,Yanfeng Lu,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Max-V1 is a one-stage end-to-end autonomous driving framework that formulates trajectory planning as next waypoint prediction using Vision-Language Models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes with 30% improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language task and create a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns with the sequential nature of driving, enabling end-to-end trajectory prediction directly from camera input.

Method: Uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for one-stage end-to-end trajectory prediction, formulating trajectory planning as next waypoint prediction with principled supervision strategy derived from statistical modeling and imitation learning from expert demonstrations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes dataset with over 30% improvement compared to prior baselines, and demonstrates superior generalization on cross-domain datasets from diverse vehicles.

Conclusion: The framework enables fundamental driving behaviors and lays the foundation for more capable self-driving agents, showing notable potential for cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability.

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will
be available upon publication.

### [12] [Efficient CNN Compression via Multi-method Low Rank Factorization and Feature Map Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00062)
*M. Kokhazadeh,G. Keramidas,V. Kelefouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end DSE framework for CNN compression using LRF with novel rank selection, one-shot fine-tuning, and multiple decomposition methods per layer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in LRF: optimal rank selection, large design space, long fine-tuning, and limited compatibility across layer types and decomposition methods.

Method: Feature map similarity-based rank selection, one-shot fine-tuning, integration of 3 LRF techniques for Conv layers and 3 for FC layers, applied selectively per-layer.

Result: Achieves substantial compression with minimal accuracy loss, outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on 14 CNN models across 8 datasets.

Conclusion: Combining multiple LRF methods per layer yields better compression than uniform single-method approach, with practical insights on technique effectiveness.

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

(LLM), capable of assessing the five senses (Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu,
Shitsuke) in a standardized way through intelligent image analysis. The
system's reliability was validated using Cohen's concordance coefficient (kappa
= 0.75), showing strong alignment between the automated assessments and the
corresponding human audits. The results indicate that the proposed solution
contributes significantly to continuous improvement in automotive manufacturing
environments, speeding up the audit process by 50% of the traditional time and
maintaining the consistency of the assessments, with a 99.8% reduction in
operating costs compared to traditional manual audits. The methodology

### [14] [OIG-Bench: A Multi-Agent Annotated Benchmark for Multimodal One-Image Guides Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00069)
*Jiancong Xie,Wenjin Wang,Zhuomeng Zhang,Zihan Liu,Qi Liu,Ke Feng,Zixun Sun,Yuedong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OIG-Bench is a benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on One-Image Guide understanding, showing current models struggle with complex visual-text relationships despite Qwen2.5-VL-72B achieving 77% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of MLLMs for human-like understanding in One-Image Guides (visual formats combining text, imagery, and symbols) is insufficiently explored, despite their importance for human perception and comprehension.

Method: Developed a semi-automated annotation pipeline using multiple intelligent agents to generate preliminary image descriptions, helping humans construct image-text pairs for the OIG-Bench dataset.

Result: Evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs showed Qwen2.5-VL-72B performs best with 77% accuracy, but all models exhibit weaknesses in semantic understanding and logical reasoning. The multi-agent annotation system outperformed all MLLMs in image captioning.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs still struggle to accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships in One-Image Guides, and the proposed multi-agent annotation system shows promise for high-quality image description generation and dataset construction.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

TL;DR: Geo-R1 is a reasoning-centric post-training framework that enhances geospatial reasoning in vision-language models through a two-stage approach: thinking scaffolding via supervised fine-tuning and reasoning elevation using reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unlock geospatial reasoning capabilities in vision-language models without requiring costly human reasoning annotations, by developing a scalable post-training framework.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Scaffolding stage uses supervised fine-tuning on synthetic chain-of-thought exemplars to instill geospatial thinking paradigm; 2) Elevating stage employs GRPO-based reinforcement learning on weakly-supervised cross-view pairing proxy for verifiable reward signals.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across various geospatial reasoning benchmarks and extends geospatial modeling from traditional pretraining/finetuning to reasoning-first post-training.

Conclusion: Geo-R1 successfully enables geospatial reasoning in vision-language models through its reasoning-centric framework, providing a scalable solution that doesn't rely on expensive human annotations while delivering superior performance.

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

### [16] [Enhancing Certifiable Semantic Robustness via Robust Pruning of Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00083)
*Hanjiang Hu,Bowei Li,Ziwei Wang,Tianhao Wei,Casidhe Hutchison,Eric Sample,Changliu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neural network pruning method based on Unbiased and Smooth Neuron (USN) metric to address over-parameterization in certified robustness against semantic transformations like brightness and contrast perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current certified training and robustness certification methods face challenges with over-parameterization, which hinders tightness and scalability due to over-complicated neural networks.

Method: First analyze layer/neuron stability against input perturbations, then introduce USN metric-based pruning that removes low-USN neurons and retains high-USN ones. Also propose Wasserstein distance loss to concentrate pruned neurons across layers.

Result: Validated on robust keypoint detection with brightness/contrast perturbations, achieving superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The USN-based pruning method effectively preserves model expressiveness while addressing over-parameterization, leading to improved certified robustness against semantic transformations.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

*Abu Hasnat Mohammad Rubaiyat,Jordan Vincent,Colin Olson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hyperspectral anomaly detection method using transport-based mathematical modeling and signed cumulative distribution transform (SCDT) to represent pixels as deformed template patterns, with unsupervised subspace modeling for background signal detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral anomaly detection faces challenges in complex real-world environments with limited prior knowledge of target signatures, requiring improved techniques for civilian and military applications.

Method: Proposes a transport-based model viewing pixels as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown deformations, representing them in SCDT domain, then using unsupervised subspace modeling to construct background signal models.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The transport-based approach with SCDT representation and unsupervised subspace modeling provides an effective solution for hyperspectral anomaly detection, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOLM is a watermarking framework that uses key-dependent LoRA adapters to embed imperceptible watermarks in generative models, achieving robust detection against various attacks while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about detecting and attributing AI-generated images, as existing watermarking methods are fragile to distortions, susceptible to removal, and expensive to update when keys change.

Method: Proposes a framework using key-dependent perturbation of model parameters, specifically implementing Mixture of LoRA Markers (MOLM) where binary keys activate lightweight LoRA adapters in residual and attention blocks without requiring key-specific retraining.

Result: Experiments on Stable Diffusion and FLUX show MOLM preserves image quality while achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression, regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the extractor.

Conclusion: MOLM provides an effective watermarking solution that maintains imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness without the need for expensive retraining when watermarking keys change.

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

TL;DR: CROWD is a unified framework for Open-World Object Detection that addresses semantic confusion and catastrophic forgetting through combinatorial data discovery and representation learning, achieving significant improvements in both known-class accuracy and unknown object recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Open-World Object Detection approaches suffer from semantic confusion between known and unknown classes and catastrophic forgetting, leading to reduced unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy.

Method: Proposes CROWD framework with two components: CROWD-Discover uses Submodular Conditional Gain functions to strategically mine unknown instances distinct from known objects, and CROWD-Learn employs combinatorial objectives to disentangle known/unknown representations while maintaining discriminative coherence among known classes.

Result: Achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and S-OWODB benchmarks respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading baselines.

Conclusion: CROWD effectively mitigates semantic confusion and catastrophic forgetting in Open-World Object Detection through its combinatorial approach to discovery and learning, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

*Arpan Mahara,Md Rezaul Karim Khan,Naphtali Rishe,Wenjia Wang,Seyed Masoud Sadjadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ExpDWT-VAE, a method that enhances VAE latent space for satellite imagery by integrating spatial and frequency-domain features using Discrete Wavelet Transform, improving latent diffusion models for remote sensing applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) show advantages in remote sensing, most studies focus on enhancing LDMs rather than improving the intrinsic latent space representation itself. There's a scarcity of research explicitly targeting latent space improvements.

Method: ExpDWT-VAE uses dual branches: one processes spatial domain input with convolutions, while the other extracts frequency-domain features via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolution, and inverse DWT reconstruction. The integrated spatial-frequency representation is refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian mapping.

Result: Experimental results on a new satellite imagery dataset from TerraFly mapping system show the method effectively enhances latent space representation across multiple performance metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed ExpDWT-VAE method successfully improves VAE latent space representation for satellite imagery by leveraging both spatial and frequency-domain information through wavelet transform, demonstrating efficacy in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoTraj-Bench is a new benchmark for ego-centric trajectory prediction that addresses real-world perceptual artifacts like occlusions and tracking drift. BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model, achieves state-of-the-art performance by concurrently denoising historical observations and forecasting future motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory prediction methods assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for real-world perceptual artifacts in first-person vision such as occlusions, ID switches, and tracking drift, which limits model robustness in practical deployment.

Method: Proposes BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that uses a shared latent representation to denoise historical observations and forecast future motion simultaneously. Incorporates EgoAnchor mechanism to condition the prediction decoder on distilled historical features via feature modulation.

Result: BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The EgoTraj-Bench benchmark and BiFlow model provide a critical foundation for developing trajectory forecasting systems that are resilient to the challenges of real-world, ego-centric perception.

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

TL;DR: Comparative analysis shows that zero-shot medical Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like BiomedCLIP can match or outperform supervised CNNs in chest radiograph interpretation when properly calibrated with decision threshold optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of zero-shot medical VLMs against supervised CNNs for automated chest radiograph interpretation, particularly for pneumonia and tuberculosis detection.

Method: Comparative analysis between supervised lightweight CNN and zero-shot BiomedCLIP VLM on PneumoniaMNIST (pneumonia detection) and Shenzhen TB dataset (tuberculosis detection), with decision threshold calibration applied to the VLM.

Result: After calibration, BiomedCLIP achieved F1-score of 0.8841 vs CNN's 0.8803 for pneumonia detection, and improved from 0.4812 to 0.7684 (vs CNN's 0.7834) for tuberculosis detection.

Conclusion: Proper calibration is essential for unlocking the full diagnostic potential of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to compete with or surpass task-specific supervised models in medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents struggle with long-horizon tasks due to memory constraints, either truncating history or using simple textual summaries that risk losing critical visual information needed for future decisions.

Method: PAL-UI combines a dual-level summarization agent (capturing observation-level cues and action-level outcomes) with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows recalling specific historical screenshots during planning. Models are trained on 8.6K mobile GUI navigation samples based on Qwen2.5-VL.

Result: PAL-UI significantly outperforms baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under data-efficient settings, and shows strong cross-domain generalization to web navigation without additional training.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of active memory retrieval for enhancing long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet
long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise meningioma delineation is crucial for effective radiotherapy planning, but automated deep learning approaches struggle with tumor heterogeneity, and generic segmentation tools lack specificity for clinical tasks.

Method: Interactive-MEN-RT integrates AI with clinical input through multiple interaction methods including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and scribbles for 3D meningioma segmentation.

Result: Evaluation on 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans showed substantial improvement over other methods, achieving Dice similarity coefficients of 77.6% and Intersection over Union scores of 64.8%.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the need for clinically tailored segmentation solutions in critical applications like meningioma radiotherapy planning.

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models struggle with subject-consistent generation due to difficulty parsing prompts with complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and multi-subject interactions.

Method: Proposes MLLM-DiT framework where a pretrained multimodal large language model performs cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and disentangle roles/attributes/interactions, generating subject-aware hidden states that condition diffusion transformers.

Result: Experiments on OpenS2V benchmark show superior performance in subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance, outperforming existing open-source and commercial models.

Conclusion: BindWeave effectively addresses subject-consistent video generation challenges through unified cross-modal reasoning and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over
extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short
in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

*Wang Zhang,Huaqiu Li,Xiaowan Hu,Tao Jiang,Zikang Chen,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCNet addresses limitations in self-supervised denoising by controlling spectral learning to preserve high-frequency details while avoiding noise amplification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised denoising methods fail to preserve high-frequency structural details and learn high-frequency noise from mapped noisy images during training.

Method: Proposes SCNet with three components: frequency band selection strategy, Lipschitz-constrained parameter optimization, and Spectral Separation and Reconstruction module for noise/high-frequency detail separation.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate SCNet's effectiveness in preserving image details while reducing noise.

Conclusion: SCNet successfully addresses spectral bias in self-supervised denoising by controlling frequency learning and separating noise from structural details.

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

TL;DR: VLOD-TTA is a test-time adaptation framework for vision-language object detectors that improves zero-shot performance under domain shift using IoU-weighted entropy and image-conditioned prompt selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language object detectors perform well in zero-shot recognition but degrade under domain shift, requiring adaptation methods to maintain performance across different domains.

Method: Proposes two key techniques: 1) IoU-weighted entropy objective that focuses adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters, and 2) image-conditioned prompt selection that ranks and fuses the most informative prompts with detector logits.

Result: Benchmarking across diverse distribution shifts (stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light conditions, common corruptions) shows consistent improvements over zero-shot and TTA baselines for both YOLO-World and Grounding DINO detectors.

Conclusion: VLOD-TTA effectively adapts vision-language object detectors to domain shifts through proposal clustering and intelligent prompt selection, demonstrating robust performance across various challenging conditions.

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with
text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain
shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs
that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores.
First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent
improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines. Code :

multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a
curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial
limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source
models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These
findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing
compositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Our code and dataset are

### [29] [Normal-Abnormal Guided Generalist Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00495)
*Yuexin Wang,Xiaolei Wang,Yizheng Gong,Jimin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAGL is a generalist anomaly detection framework that uses both normal and abnormal samples as references, outperforming previous methods that only used normal samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous GAD methods only used normal samples as references, ignoring valuable information from anomalous samples that are often available in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) with two components: Residual Mining (RM) to extract abnormal patterns from reference residuals, and Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL) to adaptively learn anomaly features through residual mapping.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show the method significantly outperforms existing GAD approaches.

Conclusion: This is the first work to adopt a mixture of normal and abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection, enabling more accurate and efficient cross-domain anomaly detection.

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

*Kaiqi Zhang,Mingguan Yang,Dali Chang,Chun Chen,Yuxiang Zhang,Kexun He,Jing Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAF is a feature extraction technique that fuses relative image features with absolute numerical values to improve iterative method selection for sparse linear systems, achieving 5.86%-11.50% faster solution times than conventional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-based selection approaches for sparse linear systems suffer from feature ambiguity where distinct matrices can have identical image representations, leading to suboptimal method selection.

Method: RAF (Relative-Absolute Fusion) simultaneously extracts and fuses image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical values as absolute features to create comprehensive matrix representations.

Result: Evaluation on SuiteSparse and BMCMat datasets showed solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s (5.86%-11.50% faster) compared to conventional image-based approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: RAF effectively prevents feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, improves selection accuracy, and unlocks the potential of image-based selection approaches for sparse linear systems.

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

### [31] [Affordance-Guided Diffusion Prior for 3D Hand Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00506)
*Naru Suzuki,Takehiko Ohkawa,Tatsuro Banno,Jihyun Lee,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based generative model that refines 3D hand poses using affordance-aware textual descriptions to handle severe occlusions in hand-object interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reconstructing 3D hand poses when large portions are heavily occluded by leveraging contextual knowledge like affordances, where object shape and function suggest typical grasping patterns.

Method: Proposes a generative prior using diffusion models that learn plausible hand pose distributions conditioned on affordance descriptions inferred from a large vision-language model, enabling refinement of occluded regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet dataset show significant improvement in hand pose estimation over recent regression methods and diffusion-based refinement without contextual reasoning.

Conclusion: Affordance-guided refinement using textual descriptions effectively improves hand pose accuracy and functional coherence in severely occluded scenarios.

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPIC is a progressive learning framework that improves multi-modal large model efficiency through token compression while maintaining performance via consistency distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual tokens consume excessive computational resources in MLLMs, and existing compression methods overlook the increased learning difficulty caused by feature space perturbations from token compression.

Method: Progressive Consistency Distillation framework that decomposes feature perturbations into token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, using token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation with teacher model guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior effectiveness, robustness, and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: EPIC successfully addresses the training difficulty of token compression in MLLMs through progressive consistency distillation, achieving efficient models without compromising performance.

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

*Darya Taratynova,Ahmed Aly,Numan Saeed,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CardioBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating foundation models in echocardiography, unifying 8 public datasets across 9 tasks with standardized evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are transforming medical imaging but lack standardized evaluation in echocardiography due to unique challenges like noisy data, frame redundancy, and limited public datasets with private evaluations hindering comparability.

Method: Created CardioBench by unifying 8 public echocardiography datasets into standardized evaluation suite with 4 regression and 5 classification tasks. Evaluated cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose foundation models under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols.

Result: Found complementary strengths: temporal modeling crucial for functional regression, retrieval robust under distribution shift, domain-specific text encoders capture physiological meaning. General-purpose encoders transfer well but struggle with fine-grained distinctions like view classification and subtle pathology.

Conclusion: CardioBench establishes reproducible reference point for echocardiography foundation models, providing actionable insights to guide future model design through released preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

### [34] [Cascaded Diffusion Framework for Probabilistic Coarse-to-Fine Hand Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00527)
*Taeyun Woo,Jinah Park,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework for 3D hand pose reconstruction that combines probabilistic modeling with cascaded refinement to address pose ambiguities and capture pose uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deterministic models struggle with pose ambiguities from self-occlusions and complex articulations, while probabilistic methods are limited to single-stage estimation without refinement capabilities.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Joint diffusion model samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, 2) Mesh Latent Diffusion Model reconstructs 3D hand mesh conditioned on joint samples, trained with diverse hypotheses in learned latent space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 datasets while effectively modeling pose distributions.

Conclusion: The proposed cascaded diffusion framework successfully combines probabilistic modeling with sequential refinement, overcoming limitations of both deterministic and single-stage probabilistic approaches for 3D hand pose reconstruction.

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Forestpest-YOLO is a detection framework optimized for agricultural pest detection in forestry remote sensing, achieving state-of-the-art performance through lossless downsampling, cross-stage feature fusion, and improved loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural pest detection in forestry environments is challenging due to small, occluded targets that are visually similar to cluttered backgrounds, causing conventional object detection models to fail due to loss of fine-grained features and inability to handle extreme data imbalance.

Method: Built on YOLOv8 architecture with three key innovations: 1) SPD-Conv for lossless downsampling to preserve small target details, 2) CSPOK cross-stage feature fusion block for enhanced multi-scale representation and background noise suppression, 3) VarifocalLoss to focus on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples.

Result: Extensive experiments on the self-constructed ForestPest dataset show Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance with marked improvements in detecting small, occluded pests, significantly outperforming established baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed Forestpest-YOLO framework effectively addresses the challenges of agricultural pest detection in complex forestry environments through synergistic architectural improvements and refined training objectives.

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

*Henrik Pichler,Janis Keuper,Matthew Copping*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision foundation models like MaskDINO can achieve near-parity performance with extensively trained traditional models (YoloV9) for mold colony detection on Petri dishes using only 150 images, enabling data-efficient automation in microbiology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that exhaustive annotation is not required for new vision tasks, challenging the conventional approach of manual annotation and extensive training in microbiology automation.

Method: Compiled a dataset of 5000 Petri dish images with bounding boxes, simulating traditional, few-shot, and low-shot scenarios. Benchmarked vision foundation models against traditional baselines using task-specific metrics.

Result: MaskDINO achieved near-parity with extensively trained YoloV9 when fine-tuned on only 150 images, remained competitive with just 25 images (reliable on ~70% of samples), and showed superior upper-bound performance compared to traditional models.

Conclusion: Data-efficient foundation models can match traditional approaches with significantly less data, enabling faster development and iterative improvement of automated microbiological systems with better performance potential.

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes adaptive shared experts (ASE) in LoRA-based MoE for multi-task learning, improving STL to MTL transition and expert specialization through router-computed gating weights and fine-grained expert design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MoE-MTL methods rely on single-task pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient knowledge sharing during STL to MTL transition.

Method: ASE with router-computed gating weights for shared experts jointly normalized with sparse experts, plus fine-grained experts by increasing LoRA expert count while reducing rank proportionally.

Result: Extensive experiments on PASCAL-Context benchmark show consistent performance improvements across diverse configurations and validate effectiveness of fine-grained designs.

Conclusion: ASE facilitates better STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization and cooperation, and enables more effective knowledge sharing under comparable parameter budget.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArbInterp is a novel generative video frame interpolation framework that enables flexible interpolation at any timestamp and any length, overcoming limitations of fixed-frame methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative VFI methods can only synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking flexibility to adjust frame rates or sequence duration, which limits practical applications.

Method: Proposes Timestamp-aware Rotary Position Embedding (TaRoPE) for any-timestamp interpolation, and decomposes long sequences into segments with appearance-motion decoupled conditioning for seamless transitions.

Result: Outperforms prior methods across all scenarios (2x to 32x interpolation) with higher fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity.

Conclusion: ArbInterp provides a flexible and efficient solution for arbitrary-length video frame interpolation with superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF-based style transfer methods often integrate style statistics into the original NeRF pipeline, leading to suboptimal results in both content preservation and artistic stylization.

Method: Proposes multi-level dynamic style transfer with: 1) multi-level feature adaptor for capturing multi-scale spatial structures, 2) dynamic style injection module for adaptive style feature integration, and 3) multi-level cascade decoder for final stylized view generation. Also supports omni-view style transfer with 3D style references.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate outstanding performance for 3D style transfer, effectively preserving multi-scale spatial structures while transferring stylistic characteristics.

Conclusion: MDS-NeRF achieves superior 3D style transfer by reengineering the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization through multi-level feature representation and dynamic style injection.

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COFA enhances VLN agents by disentangling foreground and background features and using consensus-driven online augmentation to improve navigational generalization, achieving state-of-the-art performance on REVERIE and R2R benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN approaches underutilize the distinct roles of foreground (semantic cues) and background (spatial connectivity) in visual observations, despite their intuitive importance for navigation.

Method: Proposes Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation (COFA) that: 1) Uses semantically-enhanced landmark identification to separate foreground and background features, 2) Implements consensus-driven online augmentation that consolidates two-stage voting results on feature preferences based on instructions and locations.

Result: The foreground-background augmentation strategy boosts baseline generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance on REVERIE and R2R benchmarks.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling foreground and background features through online consensus-driven augmentation significantly improves VLN agent performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervised learning often leads to over-reliance on background context (shortcut learning), limiting model robustness. Existing approaches suppress background but sacrifice useful context information.

Method: RCOR treats localization as integral to recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modeling, followed by robust non-parametric fusion of the components.

Result: RCOR improves performance of both supervised models and VLMs on datasets with in-domain and out-of-domain backgrounds, even without fine-tuning. Enables localization before recognition in complex scenes like ImageNet-1k.

Conclusion: RCOR is the first approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without compromising either, demonstrating that localization before recognition is feasible even in complex visual scenes.

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

### [44] [UCD: Unconditional Discriminator Promotes Nash Equilibrium in GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00624)
*Mengfei Xia,Nan Xue,Jiapeng Zhu,Yujun Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes using an unconditional discriminator (UCD) in GAN training to improve convergence and avoid mode collapse by removing conditional inputs that create redundant shortcuts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN training struggles with convergence and mode collapse due to redundant shortcuts created by conditional inputs in the discriminator, which prevents meaningful knowledge extraction.

Method: Employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD) that removes condition injection, forcing the discriminator to extract more comprehensive and robust features to better supervise the generator.

Result: Achieved 1.47 FID on ImageNet-64, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and state-of-the-art one-step diffusion models, with significant performance improvements and high efficiency.

Conclusion: UCD promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN training, is theoretically compatible with vanilla GAN theory, and can be implemented as a plug-in method with substantial performance gains.

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

*Yannick Hauri,Luca A. Lanzendörfer,Till Aczel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces virtual fashion photo-shoot, a new task that transforms standardized garment images into editorial fashion imagery with dynamic poses, diverse locations, and visual narratives, moving beyond traditional virtual try-on.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fashion image generation focuses on narrow tasks like virtual try-on in clean studio environments, lacking the richness of editorial fashion that presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations, and visual storytelling.

Method: The authors construct the first large-scale dataset of garment-lookbook pairs using an automated retrieval pipeline that combines visual-language reasoning with object-level localization to align garments across e-commerce and fashion media domains.

Result: They built a dataset with three quality levels: 10,000 high-quality pairs, 50,000 medium-quality pairs, and 300,000 low-quality pairs, providing a foundation for creative fashion imagery generation.

Conclusion: This work enables models to move beyond catalog-style generation toward fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling by bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

*Jiayao Jiang,Siran Peng,Bin Liu,Qi Chu,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deepfake detection method using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with learnable splines and landmark-assisted adaptive module for better artifact modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNN and Transformer-based deepfake detection methods need improvement in modeling complex non-linear forgery artifacts.

Method: Proposed LAKAN module that uses facial landmarks as structural prior to dynamically generate KAN parameters, steering image encoder towards informative facial regions with artifacts.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The combination of geometric priors with KAN's learning process creates an effective deepfake detection approach.

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReFlux is the first concept attack method designed to test concept erasure robustness in rectified flow transformers like Flux, using reverse-attention optimization and velocity guidance to reactivate suppressed concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods and attack evaluations are tailored to Stable Diffusion and show limited effectiveness when transferred to next-generation rectified flow transformers like Flux, creating a need for specialized assessment methods.

Method: Proposes a reverse-attention optimization strategy to reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention, reinforced by velocity-guided dynamics for robust concept reactivation and consistency-preserving objectives to maintain global layout.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a reliable benchmark for evaluating concept erasure robustness in rectified flow transformers.

Conclusion: ReFlux successfully addresses the gap in evaluating concept erasure robustness for next-generation T2I models, providing an effective attack method specifically designed for rectified flow frameworks.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-sensor fusion provides robust perception for autonomous vehicles, combining camera semantic information with radar distance measurements cost-effectively. Map segmentation faces challenges in accuracy and real-time performance.

Method: Proposes a real-time map segmentation architecture using cameras and radars in BEV space, featuring an advanced loss set and lightweight head to improve perception results while maintaining accuracy and per-class balancing.

Result: Achieves 53.5 mIoU comparable to large models, while setting new benchmark for inference time with 260% improvement over strongest baseline models.

Conclusion: The camera-radar fusion approach provides an efficient solution for real-time map segmentation, balancing high accuracy with significantly improved inference speed.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a
more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the
unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion
offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from
cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring
excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map
segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its
environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high
accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and
radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map
segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class
balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set
together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our
results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results
comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new
benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline
models.

*Shaocong Zhu,Zhiwei Li,Xinghua Li,Huanfeng Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised cloud detection method called SpecMCD that combines spectral features and multi-scale scene-level deep networks to generate accurate pixel-level cloud masks from optical satellite images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clouds degrade optical satellite image quality, limiting applications. Current deep learning methods struggle with thin clouds and low-quality training samples, leaving room for improvement in cloud detection accuracy.

Method: Uses progressive training with multi-scale scene-level dataset, combines multi-scale probability maps with cloud thickness maps, and applies adaptive thresholds with distance-weighted optimization to generate binary cloud masks.

Result: Tested on WDCD and GF1MS-WHU datasets with 60 Gaofen-1 multispectral images. Achieved over 7.82% improvement in F1-score compared to other weakly supervised methods like WDCD and WSFNet.

Conclusion: SpecMCD demonstrates superior performance for cloud detection under different cloud coverage conditions, showing strong potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which
seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been
widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.
However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of
training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,
leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and
multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate
pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training
framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale
scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are
then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness
map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large
cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on
the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales
and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.
Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1
multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection
methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method
shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential
of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage
conditions.

*Beomsu Kim,Byunghee Cha,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new loss function called manifold feature distance (MFD) to address oscillatory training dynamics in Consistency Models (CMs), enabling faster training with smaller batch sizes while improving sample quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consistency Models require prolonged training with large batch sizes to achieve competitive sample quality. The authors discovered that CM tangents (output update directions) are oscillatory and move parallel to the data manifold rather than toward it, which hinders efficient training.

Method: The authors propose a manifold feature distance (MFD) loss function that provides manifold-aligned tangents pointing toward the data manifold. This method, called Align Your Tangent (AYT), mitigates oscillatory training dynamics.

Result: AYT accelerates CM training by orders of magnitude, outperforms LPIPS metric, and enables training with extremely small batch sizes without compromising sample quality.

Conclusion: The proposed AYT method with MFD loss effectively addresses oscillatory training dynamics in Consistency Models, significantly improving training efficiency and sample quality while reducing batch size requirements.

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

*Huaying Li,Liansheng Wang,Yinran Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes U2-rPCA, an unsupervised unfolded robust PCA method for ultrasound clutter filtering that preserves interpretability and doesn't require ground truth labels, achieving 2-10 dB CNR improvement over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SVD and rPCA methods have limitations in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow separation, while supervised deep learning methods face interpretability issues and lack of ground truth labels for training.

Method: Unfolds iteratively reweighted least squares rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization, adds sparse-enhancement unit to capture micro-flow signals, and trains as adaptive filter using part of image sequence.

Result: Outperformed SVD-based method, rPCA baseline, and other deep learning filters on in-silico and in-vivo datasets, improving CNR of power Doppler image by 2-10 dB.

Conclusion: U2-rPCA successfully addresses interpretability and ground truth challenges in ultrasound clutter filtering while achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound
microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal
component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,
both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow
separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep
learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly
separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised
filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and
in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by
algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this
end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that
preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning
labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.
A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability
to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter
that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following
frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo
datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the
SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.
Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of
the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated
through ablation studies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain adaptation framework for brain vessel segmentation that uses image-to-image translation with disentanglement techniques to handle multiple imaging modalities without domain-specific model design or data harmonization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain vessel morphology is complex and existing segmentation models focus on single modalities, but comprehensive cerebrovascular understanding requires handling multiple acquisition procedures and domains.

Method: Employ disentanglement techniques to independently manipulate image properties, specifically focusing on vessel appearances while preserving spatial information like shapes and locations crucial for segmentation.

Result: The framework effectively bridges large domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types, demonstrating robustness and versatility in cerebrovascular segmentation.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation methodologies show strong potential for accurate cerebrovascular image segmentation across multiple scenarios, with the framework successfully handling varied domain gaps without requiring domain-specific designs.

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for
automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging
modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a
comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and
varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.
Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required
annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our
framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain
adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in
multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at

*Leah Bar,Liron Mor Yosef,Shai Zucker,Neta Shoham,Inbar Seroussi,Nir Sochen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a geometric framework that unifies geometric and probabilistic perspectives in generative AI for images, leading to a new deterministic model called Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM) that outperforms Latent Diffusion Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative AI approaches often overlook geometric structure and focus only on probabilistic methods, treating probability distributions in latent spaces as uninteresting or predefined. The authors aim to unify geometric and probabilistic perspectives.

Method: The study provides a geometric framework and kernel-based probabilistic method simultaneously, interpreting diffusion models as projection mechanisms onto the manifold of "good images". This leads to the construction of the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM) operating in both pixel and latent spaces.

Result: The Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in image restoration and generation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully unifies geometric and probabilistic perspectives, and the resulting MPPM models demonstrate improved performance over existing diffusion-based approaches.

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

TL;DR: Proposes binary encoding methods to reduce computational complexity for multi-class medical image segmentation, but faces challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art performance compared to one-hot encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational and memory requirements for medical image segmentation with many classes, as standard one-hot encoding increases complexity linearly with class count.

Method: Investigates binary encoding approaches including vanilla binary encoding, ECOCs, class weighting, hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees to achieve logarithmic complexity.

Result: Binary encoding methods achieved significantly lower performance (DSC 39.3-73.8) compared to one-hot encoding (DSC 82.4) in whole brain parcellation with 108 classes.

Conclusion: While binary encodings reduce computational requirements, they struggle to maintain segmentation quality, highlighting the need for future research on compact encoding strategies for large multi-class segmentation.

Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory
requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We
curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation
performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods
typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity
and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We
propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to
reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in
the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate
the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting,
hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We
apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes
based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in
so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced
challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary
encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) =
82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary
segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8.
Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this
work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large
multi-class segmentation tasks.

### [56] [Adaptive Event Stream Slicing for Open-Vocabulary Event-Based Object Detection via Vision-Language Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00681)
*Jinchang Zhang,Zijun Li,Jiakai Lin,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an event-image knowledge distillation framework with hybrid SNN-CNN architecture for open-vocabulary object detection in event data, bridging the modality gap between event streams and CLIP's visual representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras lack texture/color information, making open-vocabulary detection challenging. Current methods are limited to predefined categories and cannot generalize to novel objects. Direct CLIP transfer to event data is ineffective due to modality gap.

Method: Uses event-image knowledge distillation with CLIP as teacher model on image frames to guide event-based student model. Employs spatial attention-based distillation and hybrid SNN-CNN framework where SNN adaptively determines optimal event segmentation moments to preserve temporal information, and CNNs process features for detection.

Result: The framework enables event-based models to learn CLIP's rich visual representations directly from raw event inputs while inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge for open-vocabulary detection.

Conclusion: Successfully bridges the modality gap between event data and CLIP, enabling open-vocabulary object detection on event streams through knowledge distillation and adaptive temporal feature extraction.

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

TL;DR: ProtoMask improves prototype-based XAI by using image segmentation foundation models to generate more truthful saliency maps, restricting computations to semantic image patches to reduce uncertainty in visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prototype-based XAI methods rely on post-hoc saliency techniques that have reliability and quality issues. The authors aim to improve truthfulness of mapping between embedding and input space.

Method: Uses image segmentation foundation models to generate segmentation masks, crops images using bounding boxes from masks, and processes each mask as individual input in ProtoMask architecture.

Result: Experiments on three fine-grained classification datasets show competitive performance and unique explainability features compared to other popular models.

Conclusion: ProtoMask provides improved explainability through semantic segmentation-based approach that reduces uncertainty in saliency visualizations while maintaining competitive classification performance.

Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on
prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in
explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc
saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple
critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such
techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation
foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding
and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to
a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such
visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the
bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask
results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.
We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets
with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability
characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates
competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.

*Jiakai Lin,Jinchang Zhang,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoE-SGT enhances Concept Bottleneck Models by incorporating structured concept relationships through graph transformers and a Mixture of Experts module, improving adaptability to complex concept reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional CBMs which are single-modal and ignore structured concept relationships, aiming to improve interpretability in high-stakes domains.

Method: Constructs answer-concept and answer-question graphs for multimodal inputs, integrates Graph Transformer to capture multi-level dependencies, and replaces feed-forward layers with Mixture of Experts module for dynamic expert selection.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on multiple datasets by modeling structured concept relationships and using dynamic expert allocation.

Conclusion: MoE-SGT successfully overcomes limitations of traditional CBMs by explicitly modeling structured concept relationships and enhancing adaptability to complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high
stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting
human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are
generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that
augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs
for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among
concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level
dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck
Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters
bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the
feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model
to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while
dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning.
MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on
multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and
utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.

### [59] [Training-free Uncertainty Guidance for Complex Visual Tasks with MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00705)
*Sanghwan Kim,Rui Xiao,Stephan Alaniz,Yongqin Xian,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework that uses MLLMs' intrinsic uncertainty as guidance to enhance fine-grained perception in visual tasks without complex fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with fine-grained perception like identifying small objects or key moments, and existing methods require complicated task-specific fine-tuning that limits generalizability.

Method: Proposes using MLLMs' output entropy as a proactive guidance signal, where entropy decreases with relevant visual information. Introduces a unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty to autonomously focus on salient data.

Result: Applied to Visual Search, Long Video Understanding, and Temporal Grounding tasks, achieving performance competitive with specialized fine-tuned methods using off-the-shelf MLLMs.

Conclusion: Harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance without additional training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained
perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or
finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on
complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and
increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective,
training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a
proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy
decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a
unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty,
enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply
this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video
Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve
performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work
validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy
for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An unsupervised deep learning pipeline for motion correction in stress perfusion CMR that replaces slow iterative registration with efficient one-shot estimation, improving processing speed 15x while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional registration-based motion correction methods for quantitative stress perfusion CMR are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness and scalability of clinical adoption.

Method: Unsupervised deep learning pipeline with three-step motion correction using robust principal component analysis to reduce contrast effects. Aligns perfusion series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton density-weighted series). Trained on multivendor data from 201 patients.

Result: Significantly improved temporal smoothness (p<0.001), comparable myocardial alignment (Dice = 0.92 vs 0.91 baseline), reduced standard deviation in myocardium (0.52 vs 0.55 ml/min/g), and 15x faster processing time.

Conclusion: The deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and auxiliary images, and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction
is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based
methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness
and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction
pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot
estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal
component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion
series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton
density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data
from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via
temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously
published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal
smoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =
0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to
before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed
reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)
ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was
reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion
correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and
auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences
and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

*Annemarie Hoffsommer,Helen Schneider,Svetlana Pavlitska,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper shows that emotion prediction using only 12 EEG channels achieves 91.57% accuracy, approaching state-of-the-art results with 32 channels, demonstrating the feasibility of low-cost EEG devices for accurate emotion classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable more accessible emotion prediction using low-cost EEG devices instead of complex, resource-intensive full EEG measurements, providing a direct and unbiased alternative to subjective methods like self-assessment and facial expression analysis.

Method: Used Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data from the DEAP dataset into scaleograms, then trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion classification using subsets of EEG channels.

Result: Achieved 91.57% accuracy in predicting 4 emotion quadrants (high/low arousal and valence) using only 12 EEG channels, compared to state-of-the-art 96.9% accuracy with 32 channels.

Conclusion: Significant reduction of EEG input channels (from 32 to 12) yields high accuracy results, demonstrating the viability of low-cost EEG devices for emotion prediction tasks.

Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to
achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and
affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a
promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and
facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements
of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and
unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,
resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with
simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG
channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion
prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped
EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data
into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion
classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4
quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points
(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant
reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art
results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can

### [62] [Extreme Blind Image Restoration via Prompt-Conditioned Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00728)
*Hongeun Kim,Bryan Sangwoo Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel framework for Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR) that decomposes the challenging ELQ-to-HQ mapping by first projecting ELQ images to an intermediate LQ manifold, then using frozen BIR models for final restoration, with theoretical grounding in information theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BIR methods fail on EBIR tasks with severe compounded degradations beyond training scope, leading to artifacts and detail loss due to massive domain gap between ELQ and HQ images.

Method: Decomposes restoration into two stages: learns a projector to map ELQ images to intermediate LQ manifold, then uses frozen off-the-shelf BIR model for final HQ restoration. Uses information bottleneck theory with balanced loss function.

Result: Framework enables Look Forward Once for inference-time prompt refinement and plug-and-play strengthening of existing models without finetuning. Extensive experiments show effectiveness under severe degradation regimes.

Conclusion: The proposed decomposition approach with theoretical grounding successfully addresses EBIR challenges, providing stable training and flexible deployment while maintaining restoration quality.

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

### [63] [What You See is What You Ask: Evaluating Audio Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00808)
*Divy Kala,Eshika Khandelwal,Makarand Tapaswi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADQA is a new QA benchmark for evaluating audio descriptions (ADs) on longer video segments, addressing subjectivity in AD generation and showing current methods lag behind human-authored ADs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AD evaluation methods focus on short trimmed clips and compare against single references, ignoring the inherent subjectivity in AD writing and failing to assess whether ADs actually help BLV users understand stories and appreciate visuals.

Method: Proposed ADQA benchmark evaluates ADs on few-minute long coherent video segments using visual appreciation (VA) questions about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on plot. Analyzed subjectivity through alignment of two independent AD tracks.

Result: Quantified subjectivity in AD writing regarding when/what/how to describe. Showed current AD generation methods significantly underperform compared to human-authored ADs. Established public leaderboard for benchmarking.

Conclusion: Working with trimmed clips is inadequate for AD evaluation. ADQA provides better assessment of AD quality for BLV users. Future work should focus on longer video segments and address the identified subjectivity challenges.

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-destructive testing is crucial in ceramic manufacturing to ensure component quality without compromising integrity. Optical Coherence Tomography provides high-resolution internal imaging but requires automated analysis for efficient quality control.

Result: The system achieved excellent performance with 0.979 Dice Score, outperforming comparable studies. Inference time of 18.98 seconds per volume supports practical viability for detecting inclusions in ceramic components.

Conclusion: The proposed DL-based system enables more efficient, reliable, and automated quality control in ceramic manufacturing through accurate and fast defect detection using OCT imaging.

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure
the quality of components without compromising their integrity. In this
context, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution internal
imaging, revealing defects such as pores, delaminations, or inclusions. This
paper presents an automatic defect detection system based on Deep Learning

experimental configurations to enhance its performance. Post-processing
techniques enable both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the
predictions. The system shows an accurate behavior of 0.979 Dice Score,
outperforming comparable studies. The inference time of 18.98 seconds per
volume supports its viability for detecting inclusions, enabling more
efficient, reliable, and automated quality control.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: World-Language Models (WorldLMs) use video diffusion models as generative encoders to enhance Vision-Language Models, achieving superior spatial reasoning and enabling single-image models to perform multi-frame reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether generative world models can replace conventional vision encoders for multimodal understanding by leveraging their motion-consistency priors from video pre-training.

Method: Repurpose a video diffusion model as a generative encoder by performing a single denoising step and using the resulting latents as visual embeddings, creating Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA) as the best variant.

Result: DyVA surpasses both open-source and proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance on visual reasoning tasks, with enhanced spatial reasoning and multi-frame reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: WorldLMs represent a promising new family of VLMs that leverage world model priors, showing potential for generalist vision learners through inherited motion-consistency from video pre-training.

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MULTI-TAP is a plug-and-play architecture for evaluating image-text alignment that addresses limitations in existing methods by providing human-aligned, efficient multi-objective scoring through lightweight training on frozen LVLM hidden states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image-text alignment evaluation lacks comprehensive benchmarks and predictors that simultaneously achieve human judgment alignment, long-sequence processing, inference efficiency, and multi-objective scoring capability, especially in real-world scenarios with multiple valid descriptions.

Method: Proposed MULTI-TAP uses a plug-and-play architecture with a reward head on top of large vision-language models, training a lightweight ridge regression layer on frozen hidden states to produce both overall and fine-grained multi-objective scores.

Result: MULTI-TAP achieves significantly higher performance than existing metrics, performs on par with GPT-4o-based G-VEval despite smaller size (7-8B), and outperforms VisionREWARD in both performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and the new EYE4ALL dataset.

Conclusion: MULTI-TAP provides a robust solution for multi-objective image-text alignment evaluation, with the new EYE4ALL dataset enabling development of more accessible AI systems by capturing diverse user preferences including those of blind and low-vision individuals.

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)
individuals.

*Joana C. Costa,Tiago Roxo,Hugo Proença,Pedro R. M. Inácio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZQBA is a zero-query black-box adversarial attack that uses feature maps from one DNN to create adversarial samples that fool other models, without requiring multiple queries or training surrogate models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current black-box attacks require multiple queries or diffusion models, limiting real-world applicability. A zero-query method is needed that doesn't require training surrogate models.

Method: Extract feature maps from a DNN and add them to clean images to create adversarial samples that impair target model classification.

Result: ZQBA successfully transfers adversarial samples across different models and datasets (CIFAR, Tiny ImageNet), outperforming state-of-the-art single-query attacks while maintaining imperceptible perturbations.

Conclusion: ZQBA demonstrates vulnerabilities in DNNs for real-world applications and provides an effective zero-query attack method that maintains attack effectiveness and imperceptibility.

Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target
model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their
applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box
Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of
queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps
obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification
of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial
samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny
ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than
state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the
imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and
qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world
contexts. All the source code is available at

TL;DR: Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework preserves core diffusion characteristics in one-hot space without continuous latent spaces or masking policies, using timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss to bridge discriminative and generative learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fundamentally redefine prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving authentic diffusion characteristics directly in one-hot space, unlike conventional methods that rely on continuous latent spaces or masking policies.

Method: Directly uses float-encoded one-hot class data as diffusion input, introduces timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss between model outputs and original one-hot labels, and establishes synergistic design bridging discriminative and generative learning.

Result: Achieves superior performance on classification tasks compared to baseline and exhibits excellent text generation capabilities on image captioning, with extensive ablations validating measurable gains of each component.

Conclusion: ADD framework successfully redefines discrete diffusion by preserving authentic characteristics in one-hot space, demonstrating strong performance in both classification and text generation tasks.

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

*Haifei Zhang,Patrick Barry,Eduardo Brandao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an uncertainty-aware interpretable classifier for Concept Bottleneck Models that uses binary class-level concept prototypes for both classification and uncertainty measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBMs sacrifice predictive performance compared to end-to-end CNNs, and uncertainty propagation from concept predictions to final labels is underexplored.

Method: Learns binary class-level concept prototypes and uses distances between predicted concept vectors and prototypes as classification scores and uncertainty measures.

Result: The framework enhances interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction for uncertain/outlier inputs based on deviation from learned prototypes.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves both interpretability and robustness in CBMs through uncertainty-aware classification using concept prototypes.

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

TL;DR: Code2Video is a code-centric agent framework that generates educational videos through executable Python code, using three collaborative agents (Planner, Coder, Critic) to create professional educational content with improved efficiency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models struggle with producing professional educational videos that require disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions, limiting their educational applicability.

Method: A three-agent framework: Planner structures content into coherent flows, Coder converts instructions into executable Python code with scope-guided auto-fix, and Critic uses vision-language models with visual anchor prompts to refine layouts and ensure clarity.

Result: Achieves 40% improvement over direct code generation and produces videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials, with strong performance on the MMMC benchmark across aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and the novel TeachQuiz metric.

Conclusion: Code2Video demonstrates potential as a scalable, interpretable, and controllable approach for educational video generation, bridging the gap between code-based control and professional video production.

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse

### [71] [MetaLogic: Robustness Evaluation of Text-to-Image Models via Logically Equivalent Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00796)
*Yifan Shen,Yangyang Shu,Hye-young Paik,Yulei Sui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaLogic is a novel evaluation framework that detects semantic inconsistencies in text-to-image models by generating image pairs from logically equivalent prompts and identifying alignment failures without ground truth images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with maintaining semantic consistency when prompts undergo minor linguistic variations, exposing robustness issues in reasoning and generalization despite generating high-quality images.

Method: MetaLogic uses metamorphic testing to generate image pairs from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical, then directly compares these image pairs to identify inconsistencies and categorize alignment errors.

Result: Evaluation across state-of-the-art T2I models revealed consistent robustness failures, with Flux.dev showing 59% misalignment rate and DALLE-3 showing 71% misalignment rate, uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies overlooked by existing metrics.

Conclusion: MetaLogic provides an efficient, scalable, ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures in text-to-image models, effectively diagnosing robustness issues and generating counterexamples for model debugging and refinement.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building facades are an untapped solar energy resource in dense urban areas, but assessing their PV potential is challenging due to complex geometries and semantic components.

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative
PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and
artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.

TL;DR: PhraseStereo is the first dataset for phrase-region segmentation in stereo images, created by generating right-view images from single-view PhraseCut data using GenStereo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current phrase grounding methods are limited to single-view images, missing the rich geometric cues available in stereo vision that could improve multimodal semantic segmentation.

Method: Leveraged GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing single-view PhraseCut dataset, extending phrase grounding annotations to stereo image pairs with aligned segmentation masks.

Result: Created PhraseStereo dataset with stereo image pairs containing aligned segmentation masks and phrase annotations, enabling research at the intersection of language, vision and 3D perception.

Conclusion: PhraseStereo lays foundation for developing models that can jointly reason over semantics and geometry, addressing unique challenges in stereo phrase grounding.

Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in
images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances
in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the
rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce
PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to
stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by
leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing
single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo
domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for
multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and
context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned
segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for
future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception,
encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics
and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance
of this work.

*Xiangtao Kong,Rongyuan Wu,Shuaizheng Liu,Lingchen Sun,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSARM is a real-world image super-resolution framework that uses autoregressive modeling with next-scale prediction to achieve high-quality results with fast inference and strong robustness to input degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Real-ISR methods using diffusion models face trade-offs between quality and speed - diffusion from noise is slow but high-quality, while direct generation from input is fast but lower quality. Current approaches also suffer from robustness issues and artifacts.

Method: Two-stage training: first train a transformation network to map low-quality images to preliminary scales, then perform end-to-end full-model fine-tuning using next-scale prediction strategy from autoregressive models.

Result: NSARM achieves superior visual results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining fast inference speed. It shows much higher robustness to input image quality and stronger generalization performance.

Conclusion: The proposed NSARM framework demonstrates that autoregressive models with comprehensive fine-tuning can provide high-quality, efficient, and robust real-world image super-resolution without compromising generative capabilities.

Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ
pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality
image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is
slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,
which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches
train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,
which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering
from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual
autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong
T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the
bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we
introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive
Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation
network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary
scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive
fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without
compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual
results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality
of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes two hierarchical contrastive learning methods (G-HMLC and A-HMLC) that model inter-class relationships and imbalanced distributions across hierarchy levels, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR100 and ModelNet40.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional classification approaches neglect inherent inter-class relationships at different hierarchy levels, missing important supervisory signals for hierarchical classification tasks.

Method: Two hierarchical contrastive learning methods: G-HMLC using Gaussian Mixture Model and A-HMLC using attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features and model inter-class relationships and imbalanced class distributions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR100 and ModelNet40 datasets, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by 2 percentage points in accuracy in linear evaluation.

Conclusion: The approach effectively models hierarchical relationships and enables fine-grained clustering across all hierarchy levels, showing strong potential for computer vision and other applications.

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GSMamba, a hybrid architecture combining Mamba-based selective scanning for temporal propagation with shifted window self-attention for spatial context aggregation, along with a Gather-Scatter Mamba mechanism for feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recurrent architectures for video super-resolution suffer from vanishing gradients, lack of parallelism, and slow inference. While Mamba offers linear-time complexity for temporal modeling, it struggles with fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its causal nature.

Method: Hybrid architecture combining shifted window self-attention for spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for temporal propagation. Introduces Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM) mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame before Mamba propagation and scatters them back afterward.

Result: The proposed method effectively reduces occlusion artifacts and ensures effective redistribution of aggregated information across all frames in video super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: The GSMamba framework successfully addresses limitations of both traditional recurrent architectures and pure Mamba approaches by combining efficient temporal propagation with effective spatial context modeling for improved video super-resolution performance.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

*Roshan Kenia,Anfei Li,Rishabh Srivastava,Kaveri A. Thakoor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hybrid deep learning model called AI-CNet3D integrates cross-attention mechanisms into a 3D CNN to improve glaucoma diagnosis from OCT volumes by capturing hemiretinal asymmetries and integrating ONH/macula information, achieving superior performance with 100x fewer parameters than other attention models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional practice of condensing 3D OCT volumes into 2D reports loses key structural details needed for accurate glaucoma diagnosis, which requires analyzing asymmetries between hemiretinal regions and integrating information from optic nerve head and macula.

Method: Proposed AI-CNet3D model integrates cross-attention mechanisms into 3D CNN, divides OCT volume along two axes, uses Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) for visualization, and employs consistency-based multi-task fine-tuning aligned with Grad-CAMs for enhanced interpretability and anatomical coherence.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art attention and convolutional models across all key metrics on two large datasets, reduces parameter count by 100x compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic performance and comparable GFLOPS.

Conclusion: The AI-CNet3D model provides an efficient and interpretable solution for glaucoma diagnosis from 3D OCT data by effectively capturing anatomical asymmetries and structural details while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current source dataset selection in medical imaging transfer learning relies on researcher intuition rather than systematic principles, potentially impacting algorithm generalizability and patient outcomes.

Method: Task-based survey with machine learning practitioners, taking a human-centered HCI perspective to understand how practitioners select source datasets.

Result: Choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset properties, computational embeddings, and perceived visual/semantic similarity. Similarity ratings and expected performance are not always aligned.

Conclusion: Need for clearer definitions and HCI tools to make selection heuristics explicit and usable, providing practical insights for more systematic source selection in transfer learning.

Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source
datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus
patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than
systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a
task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that
benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI
perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate
that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset
properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic
similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always
aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants
often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions
and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,
this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in
transfer learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is time-consuming and expertise-dependent, limiting clinical applications despite being critical for assessments and research.

Method: Combines coarse alignment, ROI filtering, initial landmark approximation with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.

Result: Achieved mean localization error of 3.686 mm on 214 annotated scans, preserving anatomical distances with 2.822 mm error. Generalizes well to FaceScape dataset with 0.41 mm point-wise and 0.38 mm distance-wise errors.

Conclusion: PAL-Net provides a lightweight, scalable solution for high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, outperforming existing methods and reducing reliance on manual annotation in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for
clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While
several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark
localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input
representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a
fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical
landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse
alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of
landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.
Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net
achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant
anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to
intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further
evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise
error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing
methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh
quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy
across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets
and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and
structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for
high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical
workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation. Source code can be found at

Motivation: To enable learning-based solutions for inverse problems when ground-truth training data is expensive or impossible to obtain, especially in challenging settings with single incomplete observation models.

Method: Introduces equivariant reconstruction networks combined with self-supervised splitting losses, which provide unbiased estimates of supervised loss without requiring ground-truth data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in highly rank-deficient forward models across image inpainting, accelerated MRI, and compressive sensing experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised learning framework effectively addresses inverse problems with incomplete measurements and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a
reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods
have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining
ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this
paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the
challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete
observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context
of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised
splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased
estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image
inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we
demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in
settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Varying camera distances cause significant resolution differences in pedestrian images, making it hard to match low-resolution with high-resolution images in ReID tasks. Existing methods using super-resolution or joint learning are complex and have reached performance bottlenecks.

Method: Discovered semantic directions implying resolution differences in ReID feature space, substantiated with statistical analysis. Proposed lightweight VPFA framework that models resolution-specific feature discrepancy through vector panning feature alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show the method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models while obtaining higher efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed VPFA framework based on modeling resolution-specific feature discrepancies is effective and superior for Cross-Resolution ReID, demonstrating the value of the new finding about semantic directions in feature space.

Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant
differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match
low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the
performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution
ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for
feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has
reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic
directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic
directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of
ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using
Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this
interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning
Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel
perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive
experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while
obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of
our model based on the new finding in this paper.

*Ziqing Zhang,Kai Liu,Zheng Chen,Xi Li,Yucong Chen,Bingnan Duan,Linghe Kong,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfVSR is a novel video super-resolution method that uses an autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm to efficiently process long videos, achieving 58x speed-up over existing methods while maintaining high quality and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video super-resolution methods are inefficient and poorly scalable for long sequences due to heavy multi-step denoising costs and temporal decomposition artifacts.

Method: Reformulates VSR as autoregressive-one-step-diffusion using pre-trained DiT adapted into causal structure with rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance, plus diffusion distillation into single step with patch-wise pixel supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, delivers up to 58x speed-up over methods like MGLD-VSR, and enables efficient VSR for unbounded-length videos.

Conclusion: InfVSR pushes the frontier of long-form VSR by enabling streaming inference while leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors, with new benchmarks and semantic-level metrics for comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video
super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when
processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step
denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by
temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break
these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an
autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference
while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the
pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global
coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill
the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel
supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs
enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap
in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended
sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively
assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR,
achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and
delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will
be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/InfVSR.

Motivation: Modern T2I generation faces challenges in effectively fusing text with visual tokens in token-centric architectures trained with self-supervision.

Method: Encodes images and captions into discrete visual/textual tokens processed by joint-embedding predictive Transformer, uses cross-attention after feature predictor for conditional denoising, injects raw text embeddings before flow matching loss.

Result: Achieves strong data efficiency and open-vocabulary generalization on ImageNet-1K, consistently outperforms non-fusion and late-fusion baselines.

Conclusion: Late architectural fusion combined with objective-level alignment offers effective balance between conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.

Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric
architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing
text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a
unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete
visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive
Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the
feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic
backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow
matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same
network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by
iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on
ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency,
open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and
late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion
combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between
conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is

*Axel Barroso-Laguna,Tommaso Cavallari,Victor Adrian Prisacariu,Eric Brachmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastForward enables real-time image localization by creating maps and relocalizing query images in a single feed-forward pass, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with minimal preparation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image localization methods require hours to days of mapping time even with known camera poses, which limits practical deployment. The goal is to achieve competitive accuracy much faster.

Method: Represents multiple mapping images as features anchored in 3D space, then uses these features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for query images to estimate camera pose. Combined with image retrieval.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains including challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

Conclusion: FastForward provides a practical solution for real-time image localization by significantly reducing mapping time while maintaining competitive accuracy and strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires
building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation
we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system.
Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses,
state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst
case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we
can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a
method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image
on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple
mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward
utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for
the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple
FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when
compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore,
FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including
challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play refinement module that enhances spatial correspondence modeling in autoregressive vision-language models by jointly refining all generated tokens using global context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models struggle with spatial nature of visual signals conflicting with sequential next-token prediction, leading to suboptimal vision-language modeling results.

Method: Proposes a post-pretraining refinement module that operates on all generated tokens simultaneously, leveraging global context and relationships across tokens to improve spatial correspondence.

Result: The method improves generation quality and enhances the model's ability to produce semantically consistent results by mitigating error accumulation in sequential generation.

Conclusion: The proposed refinement module effectively enhances vision-language modeling within autoregressive frameworks by addressing spatial correspondence challenges.

Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be
effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual
signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction,
leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement
module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the
generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to
jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing
vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By
leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method
mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation
quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent
results.

*Dongli Xu,Aleksei Tiulpin,Matthew B. Blaschko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SoftCFG is a training-free method that addresses guidance diminishing and over-guidance issues in autoregressive image generation by distributing adaptive, certainty-weighted perturbations across all tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) in autoregressive models suffers from guidance diminishing (conditional-unconditional gap vanishes during decoding) and over-guidance (strong conditions distort visual coherence).

Method: SoftCFG distributes adaptive perturbations across all tokens with certainty-weighted guidance, and uses Step Normalization to bound cumulative perturbations for stable long-sequence generation.

Result: SoftCFG significantly improves image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet 256 among autoregressive models.

Conclusion: SoftCFG is an effective, training-free, model-agnostic solution that seamlessly integrates with existing AR pipelines to improve conditional image generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image
generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional
generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance
diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as
decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an
uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations
across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each
generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the
signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance
and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce
Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our
method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with
existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves
image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet
256 among autoregressive models.

*Qiming Zhao,Xingjian Li,Xiaoyu Cao,Xiaolong Wu,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextCAM enhances Class Activation Mapping (CAM) by integrating natural language descriptions using vision-language models, providing both spatial localization and semantic insight into model decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAM methods highlight spatial regions but lack semantic understanding of what attributes drive predictions, limiting interpretability in high-stakes applications.

Method: Combines CAM's spatial localization with CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis to derive channel-level semantic representations, then aggregates them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of visual evidence.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB show TextCAM produces faithful and interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

Conclusion: TextCAM successfully bridges the gap between spatial activation maps and semantic understanding, providing more comprehensive explanations for deep vision models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

*Ashim Dahal,Ankit Ghimire,Saydul Akbar Murad,Nick Rahimi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POVQA is a data-efficient pipeline that compresses video into temporally pooled images (1 fps) and aligns LVLMs with lightweight supervision, achieving significant performance improvements on video question answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA systems with large context windows only handle ~50 seconds of video without information loss. There's a need for more efficient video representation that can handle longer videos while maintaining temporal information.

Method: Compress each second of video into single temporally pooled images using motion blur and weighted averaging variants (Blend Blur with Last Frame, Weighted Average, Exponential, Ramp pooling). Fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B with supervised two-turn targets including reasoning and final answer using SFT and DPO on ReasonVQA dataset.

Result: Dramatic performance improvements on ReasonVQA dataset: F1 score from 0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528. Rationale quality significantly increases. Gains persist across different pooling schemes and show strong robustness.

Conclusion: POVQA's temporal pooling approach effectively compresses video information while maintaining temporal evidence, enabling efficient long-video question answering with significant performance improvements and cross-method robustness.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has
gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced
by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering
have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this
only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant
information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each
second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and
weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision.
Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame,
Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B
with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply
Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our
novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated
question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method
dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from
0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528.
Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO
on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the
pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on
summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot
in TVQA.

*Yuxiang Guo,Jiang Liu,Ze Wang,Hao Chen,Ximeng Sun,Yang Zhao,Jialian Wu,Xiaodong Yu,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageDoctor is a multi-aspect evaluation framework for text-to-image models that assesses image quality across four dimensions and provides pixel-level flaw heatmaps, achieving 10% improvement over scalar-based reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image model evaluation approaches use single scalar scores, limiting comprehensive and interpretable feedback on image quality.

Method: Built on a vision-language model with 'look-think-predict' paradigm: localize flaws, generate reasoning, then provide quantitative scores. Trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Strong alignment with human preference across multiple datasets and 10% improvement over scalar-based reward models when used for preference tuning.

Conclusion: ImageDoctor provides comprehensive, interpretable evaluation and serves as an effective dense reward model for text-to-image model preference alignment.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need
for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent
progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing
approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single
scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable
feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified
multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across
four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,
and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in
the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and
can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by
the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning
capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where
the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and
finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a
vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong
alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its
effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model
for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality --
achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.

*Weihua Zhang,Chengze Jiang,Jie Gui,Lu Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces adversarial training to hyperspectral classification and proposes AT-RA method to address spectral information distortion caused by adversarial attacks, achieving significant robustness improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral classification models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defense methods have limited scalability and effectiveness against strong attacks.

Method: Proposed AT-RA adversarial training method that uses data augmentation to increase spectral diversity and ensure spatial smoothness, preserving spectral semantics in hyperspectral images.

Result: AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by 21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50, while increasing benign accuracy by 2.68%.

Conclusion: Adversarial training is effective for hyperspectral security, and AT-RA successfully addresses the unique challenges of spectral information preservation in hyperspectral adversarial defense.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based
on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to
enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these
methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to
defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we
introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely
regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.
Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial
training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,
hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.
Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of
adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic
information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and
propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By
increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial
smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral
images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by
21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign
accuracy by 2.68%.

### [92] [Secure and reversible face anonymization with diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01031)
*Pol Labarbarie,Vincent Itier,William Puech*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First secure, high-quality reversible face anonymization method using diffusion models with secret key mechanism for authorized reversal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current face anonymization methods lack secure reversibility - diffusion models produce high-quality images but have no key mechanism, while existing reversible methods compromise quality.

Method: Combine secret key with latent face representations in diffusion model, use facial mask to preserve identity-irrelevant features, and employ deterministic forward/backward diffusion process.

Result: Produces high-quality anonymized faces that are less visually similar to originals compared to previous work, while enabling secure recovery with correct key.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves a good trade-off between security, image quality, and reversibility for face anonymization.

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

TL;DR: KeySG introduces a hierarchical 3D scene graph framework that uses keyframes and multi-modal information to enable efficient scene understanding and reasoning, outperforming prior methods on semantic richness and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene graph approaches are limited to predefined relationships and face scalability issues in large environments that exceed LLM context windows, requiring a more flexible and efficient representation.

Method: Hierarchical graph representation with floors, rooms, objects, and functional elements, augmented with multi-modal information from keyframes. Uses VLM for scene information extraction and hierarchical RAG pipeline for context retrieval.

Result: Outperforms prior approaches on most metrics across four benchmarks including 3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval, demonstrating superior semantic richness and efficiency.

Conclusion: KeySG provides a scalable and semantically rich framework for 3D scene understanding that enables general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning while mitigating scalability issues.

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks -- including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval -- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

Motivation: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in autonomous vehicle stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in safety-critical pipelines.

Method: Shapley-credited Context-Aware Dawid-Skene with Agreement - a game-theoretic fusion method that learns per-model, per-label, context-conditioned reliabilities from labeled history and converts model reports into agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratios combined with contextual prior and public reputation state.

Result: 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 compared to the best single model.

Conclusion: VLM fusion serves as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust decision-support component for AV pipelines, amplifying agreement among reliable models while preserving uniquely correct single-model signals and adapting to drift.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in
autonomous-vehicle (AV) stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in
safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware
Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label
understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,
context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,
converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio
that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming
distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the
proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust

TL;DR: EvoWorld is a world model that combines panoramic video generation with evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration, using geometric reprojections from 3D reconstruction to guide video synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human mental exploration and replay of 3D environments, the authors aim to create a system that can generate consistent long-term exploration videos while maintaining spatial coherence.

Method: Given a single panoramic image, EvoWorld: 1) generates future video frames using a video generator with view control, 2) evolves 3D reconstruction via a feedforward plug-and-play transformer, and 3) synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric reprojections from the evolving 3D memory.

Result: The method significantly improves visual fidelity and maintains spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, particularly excelling in loop-closure detection and spatial coherence over extended trajectories across synthetic outdoor, indoor Habitat scenes, and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: EvoWorld represents a significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling by leveraging evolving 3D memory as explicit spatial guidance for video generation.

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D
environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process,
we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with
evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.
Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video
frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then
evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play
transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric
reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior
state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in
exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the
video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target
viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual
realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration
capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic
outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world
scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial
coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains
spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a
significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning and mask boundary entanglement in existing video editing methods, enabling editing of any number of subjects in videos.

Method: Uses a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and prior-based mask retargeting module to generate multimodal information and mask sequences, then feeds these into a pretrained mask-driven video generation model.

Result: Extensive experiments on MSVBench show IMAGEdit consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods and is compatible with any mask-driven video generation model.

Conclusion: IMAGEdit significantly expands video editing applicability by overcoming key limitations and demonstrating strong generalization capability for multi-subject editing.

Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number
of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple
designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or
retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and
precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and
a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'
understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and
mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the
obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video
generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization
capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning
and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,
thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More
importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation
model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are

Motivation: Existing unlearning methods for LLMs rely on external resources like auxiliary models or commercial services, which are impractical and pose privacy risks. A self-contained approach is needed.

Method: Direct token optimization (DTO) identifies target tokens for unlearning and non-target tokens for utility preservation, then optimizes token-level objectives directly without external dependencies.

Result: DTO achieves up to 16.8× improvement in forget quality on benchmark datasets compared to latest baselines while maintaining comparable model utility.

Conclusion: DTO provides an effective self-contained solution for machine unlearning in LLMs that eliminates dependency on external resources and addresses privacy concerns while achieving superior unlearning performance.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that removes the influence of a
subset of training data (forget set) from a model without full retraining, with
applications including privacy protection, content moderation, and model
correction. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely
forgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall
utility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often
utilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI
services for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However,
dependence on these external resources is often impractical and could
potentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct
token optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs
that directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for
external resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of
tokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the
remaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model
utility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the
latter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show
that the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\times$ improvement in forget quality
on several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a
comparable level of model utility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAMA is a Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent framework that enables procedural activity understanding through interleaved multimodal reasoning using multimedia-returning tools in a training-free setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Procedural activity assistants have broad applications in daily life and professional settings, but system development for such assistants remains underexplored.

Method: Proposed TAMA framework with multimedia-returning tools and agentic flexible tool selection for multimodal reasoning without training.

Result: Improved performance on ProMQA-Assembly dataset for vision-language models (GPT-5 and MiMo-VL), with ablation studies confirming effectiveness of key framework features.

Conclusion: The framework facilitates 'thinking with images' paradigm for video and multimodal tasks, advancing development of procedural activity assistants.

Abstract: Procedural activity assistants potentially support humans in a variety of
settings, from our daily lives, e.g., cooking or assembling flat-pack
furniture, to professional situations, e.g., manufacturing or biological
experiments. Despite its potential use cases, the system development tailored
for such an assistant is still underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, called TAMA, a Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent, for procedural
activity understanding. TAMA enables interleaved multimodal reasoning by making
use of multimedia-returning tools in a training-free setting. Our experimental
result on the multimodal procedural QA dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, shows that our
approach can improve the performance of vision-language models, especially
GPT-5 and MiMo-VL. Furthermore, our ablation studies provide empirical support
for the effectiveness of two features that characterize our framework,
multimedia-returning tools and agentic flexible tool selection. We believe our
proposed framework and experimental results facilitate the thinking with images
paradigm for video and multimodal tasks, let alone the development of
procedural activity assistants.

TL;DR: DRBench is a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on complex, multi-step deep research tasks in enterprise settings, requiring information from both public web and private company knowledge bases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in existing benchmarks that focus on simple questions or web-only queries, and provide evaluation for complex, open-ended research tasks in realistic enterprise contexts.

Method: Created 15 deep research tasks across 10 domains using a synthesis pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, evaluating agents on recall, factual accuracy, and report coherence across heterogeneous data sources.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness by evaluating diverse DR agents across open- and closed-source models (GPT, Llama, Qwen) and strategies, revealing their strengths and weaknesses.

Conclusion: DRBench provides a critical evaluation framework for advancing enterprise deep research capabilities and highlights the path for future improvements.

Abstract: We introduce DRBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on complex,
open-ended deep research tasks in enterprise settings. Unlike prior benchmarks
that focus on simple questions or web-only queries, DRBench evaluates agents on
multi-step queries (for example, ``What changes should we make to our product
roadmap to ensure compliance with this standard?") that require identifying
supporting facts from both the public web and private company knowledge base.
Each task is grounded in realistic user personas and enterprise context,
spanning a heterogeneous search space that includes productivity software,
cloud file systems, emails, chat conversations, and the open web. Tasks are
generated through a carefully designed synthesis pipeline with
human-in-the-loop verification, and agents are evaluated on their ability to
recall relevant insights, maintain factual accuracy, and produce coherent,
well-structured reports. We release 15 deep research tasks across 10 domains,
such as Sales, Cybersecurity, and Compliance. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of DRBench by evaluating diverse DR agents across open- and closed-source
models (such as GPT, Llama, and Qwen) and DR strategies, highlighting their
strengths, weaknesses, and the critical path for advancing enterprise deep
research. Code is available at https://github.com/ServiceNow/drbench.

TL;DR: PrimeX dataset combines survey data with belief explanations and worldview assessments to improve language model personalization through better understanding of individual belief systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance language model alignment by incorporating individual belief systems, specifically investigating how written explanations and primal world beliefs can improve opinion prediction and personalization.

Method: Developed PrimeX dataset containing public opinion survey data from 858 US residents, supplemented with written explanations for opinions and Primal World Belief survey assessments of worldview.

Result: The additional belief information (explanations and worldview) provides value for personalizing language models, enabling better alignment with individual users.

Conclusion: PrimeX dataset opens new research avenues for both NLP and psychological communities by demonstrating the benefits of incorporating belief information for improved language model personalization.

Abstract: As the adoption of language models advances, so does the need to better
represent individual users to the model. Are there aspects of an individual's
belief system that a language model can utilize for improved alignment?
Following prior research, we investigate this question in the domain of opinion
prediction by developing PrimeX, a dataset of public opinion survey data from
858 US residents with two additional sources of belief information: written
explanations from the respondents for why they hold specific opinions, and the
Primal World Belief survey for assessing respondent worldview. We provide an
extensive initial analysis of our data and show the value of belief
explanations and worldview for personalizing language models. Our results
demonstrate how the additional belief information in PrimeX can benefit both
the NLP and psychological research communities, opening up avenues for further
study.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREFDISCO is an evaluation framework that transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using personas with sparse preferences, revealing that current LLMs struggle with personalized reasoning where identical questions require different responses based on user context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM development treats task-solving and preference alignment as separate challenges, failing in human-facing applications where correct responses must also match user needs, especially in cold-start scenarios without prior interaction history.

Method: Introduced PREFDISCO methodology using psychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences to create scenarios where identical questions require different reasoning chains depending on user context while maintaining factual accuracy.

Result: Evaluation of 21 frontier models across 10 tasks showed 29.0% of naive personalization attempts produce worse preference alignment than generic responses, yet generic responses also fail to serve individual user needs effectively.

Conclusion: Personalized reasoning requires dedicated development rather than emerging naturally, and PREFDISCO establishes it as a measurable research frontier revealing fundamental limitations in current LLMs' interactive capabilities.

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) development treats task-solving and
preference alignment as separate challenges, optimizing first for objective
correctness, then for alignment to aggregated human preferences. This paradigm
fails in human-facing applications where solving a problem correctly is
insufficient if the response mismatches the user's needs. This challenge
intensifies in just-in-time scenarios where no prior user interaction history
exists due to cold-start conditions or privacy constraints. LLMs need to
identify what they don't know about user preferences, strategically elicit
preference values through questioning, then adapt their reasoning processes and
responses accordingly -- a complicated chain of cognitive processes which we
term personalized reasoning. We introduce PREFDISCO, an evaluation methodology
that transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using
psychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences. Our framework
creates scenarios where identical questions require different reasoning chains
depending on user context, as optimal explanation approaches vary by individual
expertise and preferences while maintaining factual accuracy. Evaluation of 21
frontier models across 10 tasks reveals 29.0% of naive personalization attempts
produce worse preference alignment than generic responses, yet generic
responses also fail to serve individual user needs effectively. These findings
suggest personalized reasoning requires dedicated development rather than
emerging naturally. PREFDISCO establishes personalized reasoning as a
measurable research frontier and reveals fundamental limitations in current
LLMs' interactive capabilities, providing a foundation for developing systems
that can adapt to individual users in education, healthcare, and technical
domains where personalization is critical.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiasFreeBench is a benchmark for consistent evaluation of bias mitigation methods in LLMs, introducing unified test scenarios and a response-level metric called Bias-Free Score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias mitigation studies use inconsistent baselines and metrics, and focus on probability comparisons rather than real-world user interactions where fair and safe responses are expected.

Method: Comprehensive comparison of eight mainstream bias mitigation techniques (four prompting-based and four training-based) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended multi-turn QA) using reorganized datasets in a unified query-response setting.

Result: Systematic analysis of debiasing performance across key dimensions: prompting vs. training paradigm, model size, and generalization of training strategies to unseen bias types.

Conclusion: BiasFreeBench establishes a unified testbed for bias mitigation research and will be publicly released to enable consistent evaluation across debiasing methods.

Abstract: Existing studies on bias mitigation methods for large language models (LLMs)
use diverse baselines and metrics to evaluate debiasing performance, leading to
inconsistent comparisons among them. Moreover, their evaluations are mostly
based on the comparison between LLMs' probabilities of biased and unbiased
contexts, which ignores the gap between such evaluations and real-world use
cases where users interact with LLMs by reading model responses and expect fair
and safe outputs rather than LLMs' probabilities. To enable consistent
evaluation across debiasing methods and bridge this gap, we introduce
BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight
mainstream bias mitigation techniques (covering four prompting-based and four
training-based methods) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended
multi-turn QA) by reorganizing existing datasets into a unified query-response
setting. We further introduce a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to
measure the extent to which LLM responses are fair, safe, and
anti-stereotypical. Debiasing performances are systematically compared and
analyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model
size, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types.
We will publicly release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed
for bias mitigation research.

TL;DR: TASER is a new translation assessment metric that uses Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to perform systematic, step-by-step evaluation of translation quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both reference-based and reference-free settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing automated translation metrics by leveraging the explicit reasoning capabilities of LRMs for more accurate and interpretable translation quality assessment.

Method: Uses Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with structured prompting templates to conduct systematic evaluation. Evaluated o3 model from OpenAI with varying reasoning efforts. Tested on WMT24 Metrics Shared Task in both reference-based and reference-free scenarios.

Result: Achieved highest soft pairwise accuracy in system-level evaluation for both reference-based and reference-free settings. Reference-free variant ranked as top-performing metric among all reference-free approaches. Structured prompting outperformed open-ended approaches used with traditional LLMs.

Conclusion: Large Reasoning Models represent a measurable advancement in translation quality assessment, combining improved accuracy with transparent evaluation and interpretability across diverse language pairs.

Abstract: We introduce TASER (Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and
Reasoning), a metric that uses Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) for automated
translation quality assessment. TASER harnesses the explicit reasoning
capabilities of LRMs to conduct systematic, step-by-step evaluation of
translation quality. We evaluate TASER on the WMT24 Metrics Shared Task across
both reference-based and reference-free scenarios, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance. In system-level evaluation, TASER achieves the
highest soft pairwise accuracy in both reference-based and reference-free
settings, outperforming all existing metrics. At the segment level, TASER
maintains competitive performance with our reference-free variant ranking as
the top-performing metric among all reference-free approaches. Our experiments
reveal that structured prompting templates yield superior results with LRMs
compared to the open-ended approaches that proved optimal for traditional LLMs.
We evaluate o3, a large reasoning model from OpenAI, with varying reasoning
efforts, providing insights into the relationship between reasoning depth and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First open-source RAG pipeline for ECG-Language Models (ELMs) that improves performance over non-RAG baselines through retrieval-augmented generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in open-source implementation and systematic study of RAG pipeline design for ELMs, as existing ELMs lack proper grounding mechanisms to reduce hallucinations and improve natural language generation.

Method: Developed a RAG pipeline for ELMs that grounds model outputs in retrieved knowledge, with baselines and ablation studies for natural language generation evaluation.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets show ELMs with RAG consistently outperform non-RAG baselines and reveal key ELM design considerations.

Conclusion: The proposed RAG pipeline effectively improves ELM performance and provides the first open-source implementation for ECG-language modeling with retrieval augmentation.

Abstract: Interest in generative Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs) is growing,
as they can produce textual responses conditioned on ECG signals and textual
queries. Unlike traditional classifiers that output label probabilities, ELMs
are more versatile, supporting domain-specific tasks (e.g., waveform analysis,
diagnosis, prognosis) as well as general tasks (e.g., open-ended questions,
dialogue). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely used in Large Language
Models (LLMs) to ground LLM outputs in retrieved knowledge, helps reduce
hallucinations and improve natural language generation (NLG). However, despite
its promise, no open-source implementation or systematic study of RAG pipeline
design for ELMs currently exists. To address this gap, we present the first
open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs, along with baselines and ablation studies
for NLG. Experiments on three public datasets show that ELMs with RAG
consistently improves performance over non-RAG baselines and highlights key ELM
design considerations. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a framework for calibrating probabilistic autoraters to model full preference distributions rather than discrete labels, addressing subjectivity in LLM alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoraters trained on discrete preference labels fail to capture subjective, ambiguous, or nuanced tasks, limiting their reliability for LLM alignment with human values.

Method: Two learning methods: 1) supervised fine-tuning for dense probabilistic labels, and 2) reinforcement learning for sparse binary labels, both using distribution-matching objectives.

Result: Fine-tuned autoraters produce better-aligned verbalized probability predictions with improved calibration, significantly lower positional bias, while maintaining performance on objective tasks.

Conclusion: Modeling full preference distributions through calibrated probabilistic autoraters provides more reliable alignment than discrete label approaches.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values increasingly
relies on using other LLMs as automated judges, or ``autoraters''. However,
their reliability is limited by a foundational issue: they are trained on
discrete preference labels, forcing a single ground truth onto tasks that are
often subjective, ambiguous, or nuanced. We argue that a reliable autorater
must learn to model the full distribution of preferences defined by a target
population. In this paper, we propose a general framework for calibrating
probabilistic autoraters to any given preference distribution. We formalize the
problem and present two learning methods tailored to different data conditions:
1) a direct supervised fine-tuning for dense, probabilistic labels, and 2) a
reinforcement learning approach for sparse, binary labels. Our empirical
results show that finetuning autoraters with a distribution-matching objective
leads to verbalized probability predictions that are better aligned with the
target preference distribution, with improved calibration and significantly
lower positional bias, all while preserving performance on objective tasks.

*Zhexiong Liu,Diane Litman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IR-Tuning is a layer-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that dynamically selects important LLM layers for text revision classification, achieving superior performance with fast convergence and low resource requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are underexplored for text classification tasks like revision classification, which requires nuanced understanding. Fine-tuning LLMs for such tasks is challenging due to expensive and scarce revision annotations.

Method: IR-Tuning uses layer-wise PEFT that dynamically selects important LLM layers based on gradient norm distribution while freezing redundant layers, making it plug-and-play and parameter-efficient.

Result: IR-Tuning outperforms several layer-wise PEFT baselines across diverse text revisions, achieving fast convergence, low GPU memory consumption, and effectiveness on small revision corpora.

Conclusion: The proposed IR-Tuning framework provides an effective solution for text revision classification with limited data, demonstrating the potential of layer-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning for nuanced classification tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary success across various
text generation tasks; however, their potential for simple yet essential text
classification remains underexplored, as LLM pre-training tends to emphasize
generation over classification. While LLMs with instruction tuning can
transform classification into a generation task, they often struggle to
categorize nuanced texts. One such example is text revision, which involves
nuanced edits between pairs of texts. Although simply fine-tuning LLMs for
revision classification seems plausible, it requires a large amount of revision
annotations, which are exceptionally expensive and scarce in the community. To
address this issue, we introduce a plug-and-play layer-wise parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) framework, i.e., IR-Tuning, which fine-tunes a subset of
important LLM layers that are dynamically selected based on their gradient norm
distribution, while freezing those of redundant layers. Extensive experiments
suggest that IR-Tuning surpasses several layer-wise PEFT baselines over diverse
text revisions, while achieving fast convergence, low GPU memory consumption,
and effectiveness on small revision corpora.

*Joe Barrow,Raj Patel,Misha Kharkovski,Ben Davies,Ryan Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SafePassage is a three-step pipeline that reduces LLM hallucinations in information extraction by generating grounded context passages and verifying their consistency with extracted entities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black box LLMs make IE easy to configure but hard to trust, as extracted information may not be grounded in source documents, leading to hallucinations.

Method: Three-step pipeline: (1) LLM extractor generates structured entities and contexts, (2) string-based global aligner, (3) scoring model to verify groundedness.

Result: Reduces hallucinations by up to 85% with minimal false positives; fine-tuned transformer encoder outperforms LLM scoring model; annotations can be collected in 1-2 hours.

Conclusion: SafePassage effectively reduces hallucinations in LLM-based IE and can be used to evaluate LLM extraction quality, with small fine-tuned models outperforming LLM scorers.

Abstract: Black box large language models (LLMs) make information extraction (IE) easy
to configure, but hard to trust. Unlike traditional information extraction
pipelines, the information "extracted" is not guaranteed to be grounded in the
document. To prevent this, this paper introduces the notion of a "safe
passage": context generated by the LLM that is both grounded in the document
and consistent with the extracted information. This is operationalized via a
three-step pipeline, SafePassage, which consists of: (1) an LLM extractor that
generates structured entities and their contexts from a document, (2) a
string-based global aligner, and (3) a scoring model. Results show that using
these three parts in conjunction reduces hallucinations by up to 85% on
information extraction tasks with minimal risk of flagging non-hallucinations.
High agreement between the SafePassage pipeline and human judgments of
extraction quality mean that the pipeline can be dually used to evaluate LLMs.
Surprisingly, results also show that using a transformer encoder fine-tuned on
a small number of task-specific examples can outperform an LLM scoring model at
flagging unsafe passages. These annotations can be collected in as little as
1-2 hours.

TL;DR: Current metrics for evaluating automatically generated radiology reports show high scores but lack clinical trust. The paper proposes a clinically grounded Meta-Evaluation framework to assess metrics' ability to capture clinical significance and identify their limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a significant gap between high scores given by existing evaluation metrics for radiology reports and clinicians' actual trust in these reports, indicating fundamental flaws in current assessment methods.

Method: Developed a Meta-Evaluation framework with clinically grounded criteria covering clinical alignment, discrimination, robustness, and monotonicity. Used a fine-grained dataset of ground truth and rewritten report pairs annotated with error types, clinical significance, and explanations.

Result: Revealed that existing metrics fail to distinguish clinically significant errors, over-penalize harmless variations, and lack consistency across error severity levels. They struggle with interpreting clinical semantics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides guidance for developing more clinically reliable evaluation methods that better align with clinical practice and can earn clinicians' trust.

Abstract: Automatically generated radiology reports often receive high scores from
existing evaluation metrics but fail to earn clinicians' trust. This gap
reveals fundamental flaws in how current metrics assess the quality of
generated reports. We rethink the design and evaluation of these metrics and
propose a clinically grounded Meta-Evaluation framework. We define clinically
grounded criteria spanning clinical alignment and key metric capabilities,
including discrimination, robustness, and monotonicity. Using a fine-grained
dataset of ground truth and rewritten report pairs annotated with error types,
clinical significance labels, and explanations, we systematically evaluate
existing metrics and reveal their limitations in interpreting clinical
semantics, such as failing to distinguish clinically significant errors,
over-penalizing harmless variations, and lacking consistency across error
severity levels. Our framework offers guidance for building more clinically
reliable evaluation methods.

Method: Developed o-mega, a hyperparameter optimization tool that systematically explores different explainable AI methods and their configurations. Evaluated on a post-claim matching pipeline using social media posts paired with refuting claims.

Result: The tool demonstrated improved transparency in automated fact-checking systems by automatically identifying optimal explainability approaches and configurations.

Conclusion: Automated optimization of explanation methods can significantly enhance interpretability of claim-matching models in critical applications like misinformation detection, contributing to more trustworthy and transparent AI systems.

*Bowen Wei,Yuan Shen Tay,Howard Liu,Jinhao Pan,Kun Luo,Ziwei Zhu,Chris Jordan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORTEX is a multi-agent LLM architecture for SOC alert triage that uses specialized agents to reduce false positives and improve investigation quality compared to single-agent LLM approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOC analysts face alert fatigue from overwhelming daily alerts, with classical detection pipelines being brittle and recent single-agent LLM approaches struggling with noisy enterprise data and lacking transparency.

Method: A multi-agent LLM architecture with specialized agents: behavior-analysis agent inspects activity sequences, evidence-gathering agents query external systems, and a reasoning agent synthesizes findings into auditable decisions.

Result: CORTEX substantially reduces false positives and improves investigation quality over state-of-the-art single-agent LLMs across diverse enterprise scenarios.

Conclusion: Multi-agent LLM architectures with specialized roles provide more effective and transparent alert triage in SOC environments compared to single-agent approaches.

Abstract: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are overwhelmed by tens of thousands of
daily alerts, with only a small fraction corresponding to genuine attacks. This
overload creates alert fatigue, leading to overlooked threats and analyst
burnout. Classical detection pipelines are brittle and context-poor, while
recent LLM-based approaches typically rely on a single model to interpret logs,
retrieve context, and adjudicate alerts end-to-end -- an approach that
struggles with noisy enterprise data and offers limited transparency. We
propose CORTEX, a multi-agent LLM architecture for high-stakes alert triage in
which specialized agents collaborate over real evidence: a behavior-analysis
agent inspects activity sequences, evidence-gathering agents query external
systems, and a reasoning agent synthesizes findings into an auditable decision.
To support training and evaluation, we release a dataset of fine-grained SOC
investigations from production environments, capturing step-by-step analyst
actions and linked tool outputs. Across diverse enterprise scenarios, CORTEX
substantially reduces false positives and improves investigation quality over
state-of-the-art single-agent LLMs.

*Zijun Wu,Yongchang Hao,Lili Mou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TokMem introduces tokenized procedural memory for LLMs, storing procedures as compact embeddings that enable targeted behavior with constant overhead, outperforming RAG and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs inefficiently rely on prompts that must be re-read at each step, scale poorly across tasks, and lack mechanisms for modular reuse of procedures.

Method: TokMem stores recurring procedures as trainable embeddings, where each memory token encodes both an address to a procedure and a control signal that steers generation. It keeps the backbone model frozen to support continual adaptation.

Result: TokMem consistently outperforms retrieval-augmented generation on 1,000 atomic recall tasks and compositional function-calling tasks, avoiding repeated context overhead while using far fewer parameters than fine-tuning.

Conclusion: TokMem establishes a scalable and modular alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning, providing explicit procedural memory for LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models rely heavily on prompts to specify tasks, recall
knowledge and guide reasoning. However, this reliance is inefficient as prompts
must be re-read at each step, scale poorly across tasks, and lack mechanisms
for modular reuse. We introduce TokMem, a tokenized procedural memory that
stores recurring procedures as compact, trainable embeddings. Each memory token
encodes both an address to a procedure and a control signal that steers
generation, enabling targeted behavior with constant-size overhead. To support
continual adaptation, TokMem keeps the backbone model frozen, allowing new
procedures to be added without interfering with existing ones. We evaluate
TokMem on 1,000 tasks for atomic recall, and on function-calling tasks for
compositional recall, where it consistently outperforms retrieval-augmented
generation while avoiding repeated context overhead, and fine-tuning with far
fewer parameters. These results establish TokMem as a scalable and modular
alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning, offering an explicit

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code generation with long contexts is critical but faces bottlenecks from high API costs and generation latency. Existing context pruning techniques work for general text but overlook code-specific structures, leading to suboptimal performance in programming tasks.

Method: Dual-stage compression: (1) coarse-grained compression identifies and ranks function-level chunks using conditional perplexity to retain only relevant functions; (2) fine-grained compression segments retained functions into blocks and selects optimal subset under adaptive token budget to maximize relevance.

Result: LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple tasks (code completion, summarization, question answering), achieving up to 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance.

Conclusion: LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code scenarios by effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence applications.

Abstract: Code generation under long contexts is becoming increasingly critical as
Large Language Models (LLMs) are required to reason over extensive information
in the codebase. While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs,
high API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing
context pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for
general text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to
suboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose
LongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed
specifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1)
coarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks
using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only
the most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments
retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal
subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across
multiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question
answering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods,
achieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance. By
effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information,
LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code
scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence
applications.

### [114] [Enhancing Rating Prediction with Off-the-Shelf LLMs Using In-Context User Reviews](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00449)
*Koki Ryu,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates using off-the-shelf LLMs for Likert-scale rating prediction, showing that user-written reviews significantly improve performance, comparable to traditional methods like matrix factorization, with concrete item reviews being more effective than general preference descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalizing LLM outputs for user preferences is an active area, but previous work focused on classification/ranking tasks and neglected Likert-scale rating prediction, which requires both language and mathematical reasoning and has significant industrial applications.

Method: Comprehensive experiments with eight off-the-shelf LLM models across three datasets, testing different in-context information including user-written reviews and general preference descriptions, and exploring prompting strategies like generating hypothetical reviews first.

Result: User-written reviews significantly improve LLM rating prediction performance, achieving results comparable to traditional matrix factorization methods. Concrete item reviews are more effective than general preference descriptions, and prompting LLMs to generate hypothetical reviews first enhances performance.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential as a solution for cold-start problems in rating prediction, with user-written reviews being particularly effective for improving performance, highlighting the value of leveraging LLM capabilities for personalized recommendation tasks.

Abstract: Personalizing the outputs of large language models (LLMs) to align with
individual user preferences is an active research area. However, previous
studies have mainly focused on classification or ranking tasks and have not
considered Likert-scale rating prediction, a regression task that requires both
language and mathematical reasoning to be solved effectively. This task has
significant industrial applications, but the utilization of LLMs remains
underexplored, particularly regarding the capabilities of off-the-shelf LLMs.
This study investigates the performance of off-the-shelf LLMs on rating
prediction, providing different in-context information. Through comprehensive
experiments with eight models across three datasets, we demonstrate that
user-written reviews significantly improve the rating prediction performance of
LLMs. This result is comparable to traditional methods like matrix
factorization, highlighting the potential of LLMs as a promising solution for
the cold-start problem. We also find that the reviews for concrete items are
more effective than general preference descriptions that are not based on any
specific item. Furthermore, we discover that prompting LLMs to first generate a
hypothetical review enhances the rating prediction performance. Our code is
available at https://github.com/ynklab/rating-prediction-with-reviews.

*Yawen Xue,Masaya Tsunokake,Yuta Koreeda,Ekant Muljibhai Amin,Takashi Sumiyoshi,Yasuhiro Sogawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agent fine-tuning improves LLM performance in specialized technical domains like Hitachi's JP1 middleware, achieving 14% better accuracy on certification exams through domain-specific training and enhanced inference techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most agentic LLM approaches use few-shot prompting which leads to lengthy inputs and high computational costs. Agent fine-tuning offers an alternative by internalizing procedural reasoning, but its effectiveness in specialized technical microdomains remains unclear.

Method: Fine-tuned LLMs using JP1-specific datasets from domain manuals and distilled reasoning trajectories generated by LLMs. Used retrieval-augmented generation with a context-answer extractor to improve information relevance during inference.

Result: Achieved 14% performance improvement over the base model on JP1 certification exam questions, demonstrating enhanced decision making accuracy and search efficiency.

Conclusion: Agent fine-tuning shows strong potential for domain-specific reasoning in complex microdomains, enabling more efficient and accurate performance in specialized technical environments.

Abstract: Agentic large language models (LLMs) have become prominent for autonomously
interacting with external environments and performing multi-step reasoning
tasks. Most approaches leverage these capabilities via in-context learning with
few-shot prompts, but this often results in lengthy inputs and higher
computational costs. Agent fine-tuning offers an alternative by enabling LLMs
to internalize procedural reasoning and domain-specific knowledge through
training on relevant data and demonstration trajectories. While prior studies
have focused on general domains, their effectiveness in specialized technical
microdomains remains unclear. This paper explores agent fine-tuning for domain
adaptation within Hitachi's JP1 middleware, a microdomain for specialized IT
operations. We fine-tuned LLMs using JP1-specific datasets derived from domain
manuals and distilled reasoning trajectories generated by LLMs themselves,
enhancing decision making accuracy and search efficiency. During inference, we
used an agentic prompt with retrieval-augmented generation and introduced a
context-answer extractor to improve information relevance. On JP1 certification
exam questions, our method achieved a 14% performance improvement over the base
model, demonstrating the potential of agent fine-tuning for domain-specific
reasoning in complex microdomains.

*Pengzhou Cheng,Lingzhong Dong,Zeng Wu,Zongru Wu,Xiangru Tang,Chengwei Qin,Zhuosheng Zhang,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agent-ScanKit is a framework that probes multimodal agents' memory and reasoning capabilities through controlled perturbations, revealing that these agents rely more on memorization than systematic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal agents for GUI interaction show limited reliability on complex tasks, raising concerns about whether they reason spuriously rather than systematically.

Method: Three orthogonal probing paradigms (visual-guided, text-guided, structure-guided) are introduced to quantify memorization vs. reasoning contributions without accessing model internals.

Result: Evaluation on 5 GUI benchmarks with 18 multimodal agents shows mechanical memorization outweighs systematic reasoning, with models functioning mainly as retrievers of training-aligned knowledge with limited generalization.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for robust reasoning modeling in multimodal agents for real-world reliability, providing insights for developing more reliable agents.

Abstract: Although numerous strategies have recently been proposed to enhance the
autonomous interaction capabilities of multimodal agents in graphical user
interface (GUI), their reliability remains limited when faced with complex or
out-of-domain tasks. This raises a fundamental question: Are existing
multimodal agents reasoning spuriously? In this paper, we propose
\textbf{Agent-ScanKit}, a systematic probing framework to unravel the memory
and reasoning capabilities of multimodal agents under controlled perturbations.
Specifically, we introduce three orthogonal probing paradigms: visual-guided,
text-guided, and structure-guided, each designed to quantify the contributions
of memorization and reasoning without requiring access to model internals. In
five publicly available GUI benchmarks involving 18 multimodal agents, the
results demonstrate that mechanical memorization often outweighs systematic
reasoning. Most of the models function predominantly as retrievers of
training-aligned knowledge, exhibiting limited generalization. Our findings
underscore the necessity of robust reasoning modeling for multimodal agents in
real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights toward the development of
reliable multimodal agents.

TL;DR: MOSS-Speech is a speech-to-speech large language model that directly understands and generates speech without text intermediates, using modality-based layer-splitting and frozen pre-training to preserve text LLM capabilities while adding native speech processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional spoken dialogue systems discard paralinguistic cues and limit expressivity through cascaded pipelines, while recent end-to-end methods still rely on text intermediates creating a fundamental bottleneck.

Method: Combines modality-based layer-splitting architecture with frozen pre-training strategy to preserve reasoning and knowledge of pretrained text LLMs while adding native speech capabilities.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in spoken question answering and delivers comparable speech-to-speech performance to text-guided systems while maintaining competitive text performance.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for expressive and efficient end-to-end speech interaction by narrowing the gap between text-guided and direct speech generation.

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems often rely on cascaded pipelines that transcribe,
process, and resynthesize speech. While effective, this design discards
paralinguistic cues and limits expressivity. Recent end-to-end methods reduce
latency and better preserve these cues, yet still rely on text intermediates,
creating a fundamental bottleneck. We present MOSS-Speech, a true
speech-to-speech large language model that directly understands and generates
speech without relying on text guidance. Our approach combines a modality-based
layer-splitting architecture with a frozen pre-training strategy, preserving
the reasoning and knowledge of pretrained text LLMs while adding native speech
capabilities. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results
in spoken question answering and delivers comparable speech-to-speech
performance relative to existing text-guided systems, while still maintaining
competitive text performance. By narrowing the gap between text-guided and
direct speech generation, our work establishes a new paradigm for expressive
and efficient end-to-end speech interaction.

TL;DR: Graph2Eval is a knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates multimodal document comprehension and web interaction tasks to comprehensively evaluate LLM-driven agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods using static datasets are inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in dynamic environments, and current LLM-based synthetic data methods cannot handle agent tasks requiring tool use and interactive capabilities.

Method: Uses knowledge graphs from multi-source external data as task space, translates semantic relations into structured multimodal tasks via subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths, with multi-stage filtering for quality assurance.

Result: Created Graph2Eval-Bench with 1,319 tasks spanning document comprehension and web interaction scenarios, showing effective differentiation of agent/model performance and revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction.

Conclusion: Graph2Eval provides an efficient framework for comprehensive agent evaluation, offering new perspectives for assessing agent capabilities in dynamic environments.

Abstract: As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and
generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately
assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks.
Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training
and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require
tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored
automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text
or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in
web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a
knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal
document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive
evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities.
In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data
serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured
multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A
multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and
similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of
the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of
multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures
reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the
framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning
document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that
Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model
performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction
across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CopyPasteLLM improves contextual faithfulness in RAG systems by training LLMs to generate high-copying responses from provided context, reducing hallucinations through genuine contextual belief.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of contextual faithfulness in RAG systems where LLMs may not consistently trust provided context, leading to hallucinations that undermine reliability.

Method: Two-stage high-copying response preference training with three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, creating an automated pipeline that transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data.

Result: CopyPasteLLM achieves 12.2% to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over best baselines, with superior performance on FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA using only 365 training samples (1/50th of baseline data).

Conclusion: CopyPasteLLM effectively recalibrates LLM reliance from internal parametric knowledge to external context through high-copying responses, significantly improving contextual faithfulness with minimal training data.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models
(LLMs) to generate contextually grounded responses, contextual faithfulness
remains challenging as LLMs may not consistently trust provided context,
leading to hallucinations that undermine reliability. We observe an inverse
correlation between response copying degree and context-unfaithful
hallucinations on RAGTruth, suggesting that higher copying degrees reduce
hallucinations by fostering genuine contextual belief. We propose CopyPasteLLM,
obtained through two-stage high-copying response preference training. We design
three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, demonstrating that
high-copying responses achieve superior contextual faithfulness and
hallucination control. These approaches enable a fully automated pipeline that
transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data for training
CopyPasteLLM. On FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA, CopyPasteLLM achieves best
performance in both counterfactual and original contexts, remarkably with 12.2%
to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over the best baseline, while
requiring only 365 training samples -- 1/50th of baseline data. To elucidate
CopyPasteLLM's effectiveness, we propose the Context-Parameter Copying
Capturing algorithm. Interestingly, this reveals that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates
reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during
generation. All codes are available at

Result: Consistently outperforms open-source baselines and approaches proprietary system performance on comprehensive benchmark.

Conclusion: Demonstrates importance of system-level integration for scalable, resilient, and adaptive AI assistants across diverse domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents for

improvements without a unifying design for robustness and adaptability. We
propose a generalist agent architecture that integrates three core components:
a collective multi-agent framework combining planning and execution agents with

consistently outperforms open-source baselines and approaches the performance
of proprietary systems. These results demonstrate the importance of
system-level integration and highlight a path toward scalable, resilient, and
adaptive AI assistants capable of operating across diverse domains and tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multilingual speech datasets have insufficient data for most languages, leading to poor model performance on the majority of supported languages.

Method: A scalable pipeline with robust media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio from parliamentary recordings.

Result: Extracted over 61k hours of aligned speech from 22 European parliaments, with 19 languages exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours. Achieved 41.8% average reduction in word error rates when finetuning ASR models.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively addresses data scarcity in multilingual speech processing by leveraging parliamentary recordings to create high-quality, large-scale speech datasets.

Abstract: Recent progress in speech processing has highlighted that high-quality
performance across languages requires substantial training data for each
individual language. While existing multilingual datasets cover many languages,
they often contain insufficient data for most languages. Thus, trained models
perform poorly on the majority of the supported languages. Our work addresses
this challenge by introducing a scalable pipeline for constructing speech
datasets from parliamentary recordings. The proposed pipeline includes robust
components for media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to
handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio. Applying this pipeline to
recordings from 22 European parliaments, we extract over 61k hours of aligned
speech segments, achieving substantial per-language coverage with 19 languages
exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours of high-quality speech
data. We obtain an average 41.8\% reduction in word error rates over baselines
when finetuning an existing ASR model on our dataset, demonstrating the
usefulness of our approach.

*Gaotang Li,Ruizhong Qiu,Xiusi Chen,Heng Ji,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations of negative log likelihood (NLL) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs and proposes a framework of probability-based objectives that adapt to model capability levels, showing that different objectives perform best at different points on the model-capability continuum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervised fine-tuning using negative log likelihood shows limited generalization, possibly because post-training violates NLL's optimality assumptions when models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision can be noisy.

Method: The authors study a general family of probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness through comprehensive experiments across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, analyzing performance across the model-capability continuum.

Result: Near the model-strong end, prior-leaning objectives that downweight low-probability tokens consistently outperform NLL; toward the model-weak end, NLL dominates; in between, no single objective prevails. Theoretical analysis explains how objectives trade places across the continuum.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of fine-tuning objectives depends on model capability, providing a principled foundation for adapting objectives to specific model strengths rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach like NLL.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for post-training large
language models (LLMs), yet it often shows limited generalization. We trace
this limitation to its default training objective: negative log likelihood
(NLL). While NLL is classically optimal when training from scratch,
post-training operates in a different paradigm and could violate its optimality
assumptions, where models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision
can be long and noisy. To this end, we study a general family of
probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness under
different conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation
studies across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, we uncover a
critical dimension that governs objective behavior: the model-capability
continuum. Near the model-strong end, prior-leaning objectives that downweight
low-probability tokens (e.g., $-p$, $-p^{10}$, thresholded variants)
consistently outperform NLL; toward the model-weak end, NLL dominates; in
between, no single objective prevails. Our theoretical analysis further
elucidates how objectives trade places across the continuum, providing a
principled foundation for adapting objectives to model capability. Our code is

*Kung-Hsiang Huang,Haoyi Qiu,Yutong Dai,Caiming Xiong,Chien-Sheng Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUI-KV is a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI agents that reduces computational costs while maintaining accuracy by exploiting spatial and temporal redundancies in GUI interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents face inefficiency challenges when processing long sequences of high-resolution screenshots, making inference slow and memory-bound. Existing cache-compression methods are suboptimal for GUI contexts as they don't account for spatial and temporal redundancy.

Method: GUI-KV combines spatial saliency guidance (augmenting attention scores with L2 norm of hidden states) and temporal redundancy scoring (projecting previous frames' keys onto current frame's key subspace) to preferentially prune redundant tokens without retraining.

Result: GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets. In a 5-screenshot setting, it reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over full-cache baseline.

Conclusion: Exploiting GUI-specific redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance, demonstrating that uniform budget allocation combined with spatial-temporal awareness provides optimal KV cache compression for GUI agents.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on vision-language models have
emerged as a promising approach to automate human-computer workflows. However,
they also face the inefficiency challenge as they process long sequences of
high-resolution screenshots and solving long-horizon tasks, making inference
slow, costly and memory-bound. While key-value (KV) caching can mitigate this,
storing the full cache is prohibitive for image-heavy contexts. Existing
cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they do not account for the
spatial and temporal redundancy of GUIs. In this work, we first analyze
attention patterns in GUI agent workloads and find that, unlike in natural
images, attention sparsity is uniformly high across all transformer layers.
This insight motivates a simple uniform budget allocation strategy, which we
show empirically outperforms more complex layer-varying schemes. Building on
this, we introduce GUI-KV, a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI
agents that requires no retraining. GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: (i)
spatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of
hidden states to better preserve semantically important visual tokens, and (ii)
temporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the
current frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history. Across
standard GUI agent benchmarks and models, GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV
compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets.
Notably, in a 5-screenshot setting on the AgentNetBench benchmark, GUI-KV
reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over the
full-cache baseline. These results demonstrate that exploiting GUI-specific
redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small reasoning models often overthink during tool use, reaching correct configurations but then overwriting them. ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic, monitors log-probability margins at sentence boundaries to trigger early termination, improving accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 25%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small reasoning models exhibit overthinking behavior in tool use, where they reach correct tool-argument configurations but continue reasoning and overwrite them with incorrect calls, revealing substantial recoverable headroom and redundant reasoning.

Method: Diagnosed overthinking via oracle rollouts injecting </think> at sentence boundaries. Adapted various early-termination baselines to tool use and introduced ThinkBrake - a training-free decoding heuristic that monitors log-probability margin between </think> and current top token at sentence boundaries, triggering termination when margin becomes small.

Result: Oracle termination lifted average accuracy from 85.8% to 94.2% while reducing tokens by 80-94%. ThinkBrake preserved or improved accuracy across BFCL's single turn, non-live and live splits while reducing tokens up to 25%, outperforming various baselines.

Conclusion: ThinkBrake effectively addresses overthinking in small reasoning models during tool use, demonstrating that early termination at sentence boundaries can significantly improve efficiency and accuracy without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Small reasoning models (SRMs) often overthink during tool use: they reach a
correct tool-argument configuration, then continue reasoning and overwrite it
with an incorrect final call. We diagnose overthinking via oracle rollouts that
inject </think> at sentence boundaries. On the Berkeley Function Calling
Leaderboard (BFCL), this oracle termination lifts average accuracy from 85.8\%
to 94.2\% while reducing tokens by 80-94\%, revealing substantial recoverable
headroom and potential redundant reasoning. While prior work on concise
reasoning has largely targeted mathematics, tool reasoning remains
underexplored. We adapt various early-termination baselines to tool use and
introduce ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic. ThinkBrake monitors
the log-probability margin between </think> and the current top token at
sentence boundaries and triggers termination when this margin becomes small.
Across BFCL's single turn, non-live and live splits, ThinkBrake preserves or

TL;DR: CHIME is a Chinese Internet meme dataset for evaluating LLMs' understanding of viral online content. LLMs struggle with culturally nuanced memes and identifying origins, performing below human levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether large language models truly understand viral internet content (memes) despite being trained on vast internet text, particularly focusing on Chinese internet memes.

Method: Created CHIME dataset with popular Chinese phrase-based memes annotated with meaning, origin, examples, and types. Designed two evaluation tasks: 1) meme explanation and origin identification, 2) multiple-choice questions for meme selection in contextual sentences.

Result: LLMs can explain some meme meanings but performance declines significantly for culturally and linguistically nuanced types. They consistently struggle with identifying meme origins. In multiple-choice tasks, models perform below human levels.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limited understanding of culturally specific internet memes, particularly regarding origins and nuanced cultural contexts. The CHIME dataset enables future research on computational meme understanding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of text from the
Internet, but do they truly understand the viral content that rapidly spreads
online -- commonly known as memes? In this paper, we introduce CHIME, a dataset
for CHinese Internet Meme Explanation. The dataset comprises popular
phrase-based memes from the Chinese Internet, annotated with detailed
information on their meaning, origin, example sentences, types, etc. To
evaluate whether LLMs understand these memes, we designed two tasks. In the
first task, we assessed the models' ability to explain a given meme, identify
its origin, and generate appropriate example sentences. The results show that
while LLMs can explain the meanings of some memes, their performance declines
significantly for culturally and linguistically nuanced meme types.
Additionally, they consistently struggle to provide accurate origins for the
memes. In the second task, we created a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
requiring LLMs to select the most appropriate meme to fill in a blank within a
contextual sentence. While the evaluated models were able to provide correct
answers, their performance remains noticeably below human levels. We have made
CHIME public and hope it will facilitate future research on computational meme
understanding.

TL;DR: ReSeek is a self-correcting framework for training search agents that enables dynamic error recovery during search episodes through a JUDGE action and dense process rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based search agents rely on sparse or rule-based rewards, which can lead to commitment to suboptimal reasoning paths without recovery mechanisms.

Method: Proposes ReSeek framework with self-correction mechanism using JUDGE action, dense instructive process rewards (correctness and utility rewards), and introduces FictionalHot benchmark to avoid data contamination.

Result: Agents trained with ReSeek significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in task success rate and path faithfulness.

Conclusion: The self-correcting framework with dynamic error recovery and dense process rewards effectively improves search agent performance on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Search agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant potential in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. Reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training these agents to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning. However, prior RL-based methods often
rely on sparse or rule-based rewards, which can lead agents to commit to
suboptimal or erroneous reasoning paths without the ability to recover. To
address these limitations, we propose ReSeek, a novel self-correcting framework
for training search agents. Our framework introduces a self-correction
mechanism that empowers the agent to dynamically identify and recover from
erroneous search paths during an episode. By invoking a special JUDGE action,
the agent can judge the information and re-plan its search strategy. To guide
this process, we design a dense, instructive process reward function, which
decomposes into a correctness reward for retrieving factual information and a
utility reward for finding information genuinely useful for the query.
Furthermore, to mitigate the risk of data contamination in existing datasets,
we introduce FictionalHot, a new and challenging benchmark with recently
curated questions requiring complex reasoning. Being intuitively reasonable and
practically simple, extensive experiments show that agents trained with ReSeek
significantly outperform SOTA baselines in task success rate and path
faithfulness.

*Li Li,Ziyi Wang,Yongliang Wu,Jianfei Cai,Xu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoT Vectors are compact representations that encode multi-step reasoning knowledge, addressing the cost and inefficiency of existing Chain-of-Thought methods while maintaining comparable performance to parameter-efficient fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Chain-of-Thought implementations like in-context learning and fine-tuning are costly and inefficient, creating a need for more cost-effective reasoning enhancement methods.

Method: Proposes CoT Vectors - compact representations of reasoning knowledge, initially as Extracted CoT Vectors and then improved as Learnable CoT Vectors optimized under a teacher-student framework to address layer-wise instability.

Result: CoT Vectors outperform existing baselines and achieve performance comparable to parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods while requiring fewer trainable parameters. Also reveals insights about reasoning processes through layer-wise performance analysis.

Conclusion: CoT Vectors provide an effective, parameter-efficient approach to enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs, while also serving as a probe to understand the functional organization of multi-step reasoning in language models.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful approach to
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
existing implementations, such as in-context learning and fine-tuning, remain
costly and inefficient. To improve CoT reasoning at a lower cost, and inspired
by the task vector paradigm, we introduce CoT Vectors, compact representations
that encode task-general, multi-step reasoning knowledge. Through experiments
with Extracted CoT Vectors, we observe pronounced layer-wise instability,
manifesting as a U-shaped performance curve that reflects a systematic
three-stage reasoning process in LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose
Learnable CoT Vectors, optimized under a teacher-student framework to provide
more stable and robust guidance. Extensive evaluations across diverse
benchmarks and models demonstrate that CoT Vectors not only outperform existing
baselines but also achieve performance comparable to parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, while requiring fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, by
treating CoT Vectors as a probe, we uncover how their effectiveness varies due
to latent space structure, information density, acquisition mechanisms, and
pre-training differences, offering new insights into the functional
organization of multi-step reasoning in LLMs. The source code will be released.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first syllabification work for the Tenyidie language using deep learning models, achieving 99.21% accuracy with BLSTM on a newly created dataset of 10,120 syllabified words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tenyidie is a low-resource Tibeto-Burman language with no prior work on syllabification, which is an important NLP task for downstream applications like morphological analysis and machine translation.

Method: Created a corpus of 10,120 syllabified Tenyidie words and applied LSTM, BLSTM, BLSTM+CRF, and Encoder-decoder deep learning architectures using an 80:10:10 train-validation-test split.

Result: Achieved highest accuracy of 99.21% with BLSTM model on the test set, demonstrating effective syllabification performance for this low-resource language.

Conclusion: The work successfully addresses syllabification for Tenyidie and will support various NLP applications including morphological analysis, POS tagging, and machine translation for this under-resourced language.

Abstract: The Tenyidie language is a low-resource language of the Tibeto-Burman family
spoken by the Tenyimia Community of Nagaland in the north-eastern part of India
and is considered a major language in Nagaland. It is tonal,
Subject-Object-Verb, and highly agglutinative in nature. Being a low-resource
language, very limited research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been
conducted. To the best of our knowledge, no work on syllabification has been
reported for this language. Among the many NLP tasks, syllabification or
syllabication is an important task in which the given word syllables are
identified. The contribution of this work is the creation of 10,120 syllabified
Tenyidie words and the application of the Deep Learning techniques on the
created corpus. In this paper, we have applied LSTM, BLSTM, BLSTM+CRF, and
Encoder-decoder deep learning architectures on our created dataset. In our
dataset split of 80:10:10 (train:validation:test) set, we achieved the highest
accuracy of 99.21% with BLSTM model on the test set. This work will find its
application in numerous other NLP applications, such as morphological analysis,
part-of-speech tagging, machine translation, etc, for the Tenyidie Language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes MCM-DPO, a multi-faceted cross-modal direct preference optimization method for alt-text generation that outperforms DPO and SFT by learning from preference pairs without requiring precise annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alt-text generation performance is limited by noisy user annotations, inconsistent standards, and MLLMs' insensitivity to context. SFT struggles due to reliance on accurate target annotations which are often flawed in user-generated alt-text.

Method: Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct Preference Optimization (MCM-DPO) that optimizes preferences across single, paired, and multi-preference dimensions covering textual, visual, and cross-modal factors. Also constructed two large-scale datasets TAlt and PAlt with 202k annotated samples and 18k preference pairs.

Result: MCM-DPO consistently outperforms both DPO and SFT, establishing a new state of the art in alt-text generation.

Conclusion: The proposed MCM-DPO method effectively improves alt-text generation by learning from preference pairs without requiring precise annotations, and the released datasets support further research in this domain.

Abstract: The alt-text generation task produces concise, context-relevant descriptions
of images, enabling blind and low-vision users to access online images. Despite
the capabilities of large vision-language models, alt-text generation
performance remains limited due to noisy user annotations, inconsistent
standards, and MLLMs' insensitivity to contextual information. Previous efforts
to fine-tune MLLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) have struggled, as SFT
relies on accurate target annotations, which are often flawed in user-generated
alt-text. To address this, we propose Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct
Preference Optimization (MCM-DPO), which improves alt-text generation by
learning to identify better options in preference pairs without requiring
precise annotations. MCM-DPO optimizes preferences across single, paired, and
multi-preference dimensions, covering textual, visual, and cross-modal factors.
In light of the scarcity of high-quality annotated and preference-labeled
datasets for alt-text, we constructed two large-scale, high-quality datasets
named TAlt and PAlt, sourced from Twitter and Pinterest. These datasets include
202k annotated alt-text samples and 18k preference pairs that cover diverse
preference dimensions, aiming to support further research in this domain.
Experimental results show that our proposed MCM-DPO method consistently
outperforms both DPO and SFT, establishing a new state of the art in alt-text
generation. We release the code and data here:

### [131] [Facilitating Cognitive Accessibility with LLMs: A Multi-Task Approach to Easy-to-Read Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00662)
*François Ledoyen,Gaël Dias,Jeremie Pantin,Alexis Lechervy,Fabrice Maurel,Youssef Chahir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates using large language models to automate Easy-to-Read content generation through multi-task learning approaches, showing benefits over single-task methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of Easy-to-Read content is time-consuming and resource-intensive, limiting accessibility for neurodivergent individuals. There's a need to automate this process using LLMs.

Method: Proposed multi-task learning approach combining text summarization, text simplification, and ETR generation. Tested two strategies: multi-task RAG for in-context learning and MTL-LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning using Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B models on a new ETR-fr dataset.

Result: Multi-task setups outperformed single-task baselines across all configurations. RAG-based strategy enabled generalization in out-of-domain settings, while MTL-LoRA achieved best performance in in-domain configurations.

Conclusion: Multi-task learning approaches effectively automate ETR content generation, with different strategies offering complementary advantages for in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Simplifying complex texts is essential for ensuring equitable access to
information, especially for individuals with cognitive impairments. The
Easy-to-Read (ETR) initiative offers a framework for making content accessible
to the neurodivergent population, but the manual creation of such texts remains
time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this work, we investigate the
potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of ETR
content. To address the scarcity of aligned corpora and the specificity of ETR
constraints, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) approach that trains models
jointly on text summarization, text simplification, and ETR generation. We
explore two different strategies: multi-task retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) for in-context learning, and MTL-LoRA for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning. Our experiments with Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B, based on ETR-fr, a
new high-quality dataset, demonstrate the benefits of multi-task setups over
single-task baselines across all configurations. Moreover, results show that
the RAG-based strategy enables generalization in out-of-domain settings, while
MTL-LoRA outperforms all learning strategies within in-domain configurations.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ETR-fr, the first dataset for Easy-to-Read text generation compliant with European guidelines, and establishes generative baselines using parameter-efficient fine-tuning on PLMs and LLMs with a comprehensive evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual Easy-to-Read text adaptations are slow, costly, and difficult to scale, limiting access to crucial information for individuals with cognitive impairments in healthcare, education, and civic life. AI-driven solutions face challenges including dataset scarcity, domain adaptation, and balancing lightweight learning of LLMs.

Method: Introduced ETR-fr dataset compliant with European ETR guidelines, implemented parameter-efficient fine-tuning on PLMs and LLMs, and created an evaluation framework using automatic metrics supplemented by human assessments with a 36-question evaluation form aligned with guidelines.

Result: PLMs perform comparably to LLMs and adapt effectively to out-of-domain texts. The evaluation framework successfully assesses the quality and accessibility of generated Easy-to-Read texts.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a scalable solution for Easy-to-Read text generation, with PLMs showing competitive performance to LLMs while being more efficient for domain adaptation tasks.

Abstract: Ensuring accessibility for individuals with cognitive impairments is
essential for autonomy, self-determination, and full citizenship. However,
manual Easy-to-Read (ETR) text adaptations are slow, costly, and difficult to
scale, limiting access to crucial information in healthcare, education, and
civic life. AI-driven ETR generation offers a scalable solution but faces key
challenges, including dataset scarcity, domain adaptation, and balancing
lightweight learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we
introduce ETR-fr, the first dataset for ETR text generation fully compliant
with European ETR guidelines. We implement parameter-efficient fine-tuning on
PLMs and LLMs to establish generative baselines. To ensure high-quality and
accessible outputs, we introduce an evaluation framework based on automatic
metrics supplemented by human assessments. The latter is conducted using a
36-question evaluation form that is aligned with the guidelines. Overall
results show that PLMs perform comparably to LLMs and adapt effectively to

TL;DR: ALARB is a dataset and benchmark for evaluating Arabic legal reasoning in LLMs, featuring 13K Saudi commercial court cases with tasks like verdict prediction and reasoning chain completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Arabic benchmarks lack focus on multistep reasoning in open-ended contexts, especially in the legal domain where complex reasoning is crucial.

Method: Created dataset with 13K commercial court cases including facts, court reasoning, verdicts, and cited clauses. Defined challenging tasks like verdict prediction, reasoning chain completion, and regulation identification. Benchmarked Arabic LLMs and performed instruction tuning.

Result: Instruction-tuning a 12B parameter model with ALARB significantly improved performance in verdict prediction and Arabic verdict generation, achieving results comparable to GPT-4o.

Conclusion: ALARB effectively evaluates and enhances Arabic LLMs' legal reasoning capabilities, demonstrating the value of domain-specific instruction tuning for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We introduce ALARB, a dataset and suite of tasks designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within the Arabic legal
domain. While existing Arabic benchmarks cover some knowledge-intensive tasks
such as retrieval and understanding, substantial datasets focusing specifically
on multistep reasoning for Arabic LLMs, especially in open-ended contexts, are
lacking. The dataset comprises over 13K commercial court cases from Saudi
Arabia, with each case including the facts presented, the reasoning of the
court, the verdict, as well as the cited clauses extracted from the regulatory
documents. We define a set of challenging tasks leveraging this dataset and
reflecting the complexity of real-world legal reasoning, including verdict
prediction, completion of reasoning chains in multistep legal arguments, and
identification of relevant regulations based on case facts. We benchmark a
representative selection of current open and closed Arabic LLMs on these tasks
and demonstrate the dataset's utility for instruction tuning. Notably, we show
that instruction-tuning a modest 12B parameter model using ALARB significantly
enhances its performance in verdict prediction and Arabic verdict generation,
reaching a level comparable to that of GPT-4o.

*Jenny Kunz,Iben Nyholm Debess,Annika Simonsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores adapting small English LLMs to Faroese through transfer learning from related Scandinavian languages, comparing different training methods and evaluating performance on new Faroese benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adapting language models to Faroese, a low-resource North Germanic language, by leveraging transfer learning from related languages due to limited Faroese training data.

Method: Start from English models, continue pre-training on Scandinavian languages (individually or combined via merging), then fine-tune on Faroese. Compare full fine-tuning with LoRA parameter-efficient tuning, using new minimal-pair benchmarks and human evaluations by Faroese linguists.

Result: Transfer from related languages is crucial but task-dependent: Icelandic improves linguistic accuracy while Danish boosts comprehension. LoRA enhances linguistic acceptability and human scores on base model, while full fine-tuning provides better comprehension and preserves model capabilities during downstream fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The optimal adaptation strategy for Faroese LLMs depends on the specific task, with different source languages and tuning methods performing best for linguistic accuracy versus comprehension tasks.

Abstract: We investigate how to adapt small, efficient LLMs to Faroese, a low-resource
North Germanic language. Starting from English models, we continue pre-training
on related Scandinavian languages, either individually or combined via merging,
before fine-tuning on Faroese. We compare full fine-tuning with
parameter-efficient tuning using LoRA, evaluating their impact on both
linguistic accuracy and text comprehension. Due to the lack of existing Faroese
evaluation data, we construct two new minimal-pair benchmarks from adapted and
newly collected datasets and complement them with human evaluations by Faroese
linguists. Our results demonstrate that transfer from related languages is
crucial, though the optimal source language depends on the task: Icelandic
enhances linguistic accuracy, whereas Danish boosts comprehension. Similarly,
the choice between full fine-tuning and LoRA is task-dependent: LoRA improves
linguistic acceptability and slightly increases human evaluation scores on the
base model, while full fine-tuning yields stronger comprehension performance
and better preserves model capabilities during downstream fine-tuning.

TL;DR: REAL-MT (Retrieval-Augmented LLM-based Machine Translation) shows promise for knowledge-intensive tasks but suffers from poor robustness under noisy retrieval contexts, especially for low-resource languages and large reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding REAL-MT reliability under noisy retrieval contexts, which is a common challenge in real-world deployment but poorly studied.

Method: Proposed a noise synthesis framework and new metrics to systematically evaluate REAL-MT robustness. Instantiated REAL-MT with Qwen-series models (standard LLMs and large reasoning models) and evaluated on idiomatic translation across different resource language pairs under synthesized noise.

Result: Low-resource language pairs degrade more severely under noise than high-resource ones, often producing nonsensical translations. Large reasoning models show no improvement in error correction and are more susceptible to noise, rationalizing incorrect contexts. Attention shifts away from source idioms to noisy content while confidence increases despite declining accuracy.

Conclusion: Current approaches have limitations, highlighting the need for self-verifying integration mechanisms. Training-free and fine-tuning strategies improve robustness but reveal a fundamental trade-off with performance in clean contexts.

Abstract: \textbf{RE}trieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{M}achine
\textbf{T}ranslation (REAL-MT) shows promise for knowledge-intensive tasks like
idiomatic translation, but its reliability under noisy retrieval contexts
remains poorly understood despite this being a common challenge in real-world
deployment. To address this gap, we propose a noise synthesis framework and new
metrics to evaluate the robustness of REAL-MT systematically. Using this
framework, we instantiate REAL-MT with Qwen-series models, including standard
LLMs and large reasoning models (LRMs) with enhanced reasoning, and evaluate
their performance on idiomatic translation across high-, medium-, and
low-resource language pairs under synthesized noise. Our results show that
low-resource language pairs, which rely more heavily on retrieved context,
degrade more severely under noise than high-resource ones and often produce
nonsensical translations. Although LRMs possess enhanced reasoning
capabilities, they show no improvement in error correction and are even more
susceptible to noise, tending to rationalize incorrect contexts. We find that
this stems from an attention shift away from the source idiom to noisy content,
while confidence increases despite declining accuracy, indicating poor
calibration. To mitigate these issues, we investigate training-free and
fine-tuning strategies, which improve robustness at the cost of performance in
clean contexts, revealing a fundamental trade-off. Our findings highlight the
limitations of current approaches, underscoring the need for self-verifying
integration mechanisms.

*Adi Simhi,Jonathan Herzig,Martin Tutek,Itay Itzhak,Idan Szpektor,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ManagerBench is a new benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic managerial scenarios where models must choose between pragmatic but harmful actions vs safe but operationally worse actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety benchmarks focus on preventing harmful content generation but overlook the challenge of agents taking harmful actions when operational goals conflict with human safety.

Method: Created ManagerBench with human-validated managerial scenarios forcing choices between pragmatic-harmful vs safe-ineffective actions, plus a control set with inanimate objects to measure pragmatism.

Result: Frontier LLMs perform poorly on the safety-pragmatism trade-off - many choose harmful options for operational goals, while others become overly safe and ineffective. Misalignment stems from flawed prioritization, not inability to perceive harm.

Conclusion: ManagerBench is a challenging benchmark for agentic behavior, addressing the critical issue of making safe choices when operational goals and alignment values conflict.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants into
autonomous agents, evaluating the safety of their actions becomes critical.
Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of
harmful content, such as toxic text. However, they overlook the challenge of
agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational
goal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce
ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic,
human-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a
pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe
action that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set,
where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's
pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate
that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism
trade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their
operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and
ineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an
inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human
judgments, but from flawed prioritization. ManagerBench is a challenging
benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when
operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.

TL;DR: ERL framework improves multi-hop reasoning in LLMs by identifying and correcting faulty reasoning steps through erase-and-regenerate process, achieving significant performance gains over SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current search-augmented LLMs suffer from reliability issues in complex multi-hop reasoning due to decomposition errors, retrieval failures, and reasoning errors that propagate through the chain.

Method: Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL) - identifies faulty reasoning steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in place to prevent error propagation.

Result: ESearch models trained with ERL achieved substantial improvements: 3B model +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, 7B model +5.38% EM and +7.22% F1 over previous SOTA on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle.

Conclusion: ERL provides a powerful paradigm shift for robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs by turning brittle reasoning into a resilient process through targeted error correction.

Abstract: While search-augmented large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive
capabilities, their reliability in complex multi-hop reasoning remains limited.
This limitation arises from three fundamental challenges: decomposition errors,
where tasks are incorrectly broken down; retrieval missing, where key evidence
fails to be retrieved; and reasoning errors, where flawed logic propagates
through the reasoning chain. A single failure in any of these stages can derail
the final answer. We propose Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a novel
framework that transforms fragile reasoning into a robust process. ERL
explicitly identifies faulty steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in
place, preventing defective logic from propagating through the reasoning chain.
This targeted correction mechanism turns brittle reasoning into a more
resilient process. Models trained with ERL, termed ESearch, achieve substantial
improvements on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, with the 3B model
achieving +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, and the 7B model achieving +5.38% EM and
+7.22% F1 over previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) results. These findings suggest
that erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for
robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: HalluGuard is a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model that detects and mitigates hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems, achieving competitive performance with larger models while using fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models are prone to hallucinations, which limits their trustworthiness in real-world applications, creating a need for effective hallucination detection and mitigation methods.

Method: Combines domain-agnostic synthetic dataset from FineWeb with multi-stage curation, generates synthetic grounded/hallucinated claims, and uses preference-based fine-tuning with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to distill large-model reasoning into a smaller model.

Result: Achieves 84.0% balanced accuracy on RAGTruth subset (matching 7B MiniCheck) and 75.7% BAcc on full benchmark (matching GPT-4o), while using roughly half the parameters of comparable specialized models.

Conclusion: HalluGuard demonstrates that smaller reasoning models can effectively detect hallucinations and compete with larger specialized and general-purpose models, providing a practical solution for improving trust in LLM applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many NLP tasks but remain prone to
hallucinations, limiting trust in real-world applications. We present
HalluGuard, a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model (SRM) for mitigating
hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). HalluGuard classifies
document-claim pairs as grounded or hallucinated and produces evidence-grounded
justifications for transparency. Our approach combines (i) a domain-agnostic
synthetic dataset derived from FineWeb and refined through multi-stage curation
and data reformation, (ii) synthetic grounded and hallucinated claims, and
(iii) preference-based fine-tuning with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to
distill large-model reasoning into a smaller backbone. On the RAGTruth subset
of the LLM-AggreFact benchmark, HalluGuard achieves 84.0% balanced accuracy
(BAcc), rivaling specialized models, MiniCheck (7B; 84.0%) and Granite Guardian
3.3 (8B; 82.2%) while using roughly half their parameters. Over the full
benchmark it reaches 75.7% BAcc, matching larger general-purpose LLMs such as
GPT-4o (75.9%). We will release HalluGuard and datasets under Apache 2.0 upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: Sci-SpanDet is a structure-aware framework for detecting AI-generated scholarly texts that combines section-conditioned stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning for precise span-level detection and cross-domain robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing AI text detection methods that neglect fine-grained span localization, exhibit weak calibration, and fail to generalize across disciplines and generators, especially in scientific writing where authorship integrity is crucial.

Method: Combines section-conditioned stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning to capture human-AI differences while mitigating topic dependence. Integrates BIO-CRF sequence labeling with pointer-based boundary decoding and confidence calibration for precise span-level detection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with F1(AI) of 80.17, AUROC of 92.63, and Span-F1 of 74.36. Shows strong resilience under adversarial rewriting and maintains balanced accuracy across IMRaD sections and diverse disciplines, substantially surpassing existing baselines.

Conclusion: Sci-SpanDet provides an effective solution for detecting AI-generated scholarly texts with precise span-level localization and cross-domain robustness, addressing critical concerns about authorship integrity in scientific publications.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scientific writing
raises serious concerns regarding authorship integrity and the reliability of
scholarly publications. Existing detection approaches mainly rely on
document-level classification or surface-level statistical cues; however, they
neglect fine-grained span localization, exhibit weak calibration, and often
fail to generalize across disciplines and generators. To address these
limitations, we present Sci-SpanDet, a structure-aware framework for detecting
AI-generated scholarly texts. The proposed method combines section-conditioned
stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning to capture nuanced
human-AI differences while mitigating topic dependence, thereby enhancing
cross-domain robustness. In addition, it integrates BIO-CRF sequence labeling
with pointer-based boundary decoding and confidence calibration to enable
precise span-level detection and reliable probability estimates. Extensive
experiments on a newly constructed cross-disciplinary dataset of 100,000

*Shunfeng Zheng,Yudi Zhang,Meng Fang,Zihan Zhang,Zhitan Wu,Mykola Pechenizkiy,Ling Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAG with foundation models shows promise for expert-level physics reasoning using a specialized multimodal dataset called PhoPile, but faces challenges that need further research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for enhancing physics reasoning in foundation models, particularly for solving Olympiad-level physics problems, inspired by how students prepare by reviewing past problems.

Method: Introduce PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset for Olympiad-level physics with diagrams, graphs, and equations. Benchmark RAG-augmented foundation models (LLMs and LMMs) using multiple retrievers on this dataset.

Result: Integration of retrieval with physics corpora improves model performance, demonstrating the potential of RAG for physics reasoning.

Conclusion: While RAG shows promise for enhancing physics reasoning in foundation models, there are challenges that motivate further research in retrieval-augmented physics reasoning.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with foundation models has achieved
strong performance across diverse tasks, but their capacity for expert-level
reasoning-such as solving Olympiad-level physics problems-remains largely
unexplored. Inspired by the way students prepare for competitions by reviewing
past problems, we investigate the potential of RAG to enhance physics reasoning
in foundation models. We introduce PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset
specifically designed for Olympiad-level physics, enabling systematic study of
retrieval-based reasoning. PhoPile includes diagrams, graphs, and equations,
capturing the inherently multimodal nature of physics problem solving. Using
PhoPile, we benchmark RAG-augmented foundation models, covering both large
language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) with multiple
retrievers. Our results demonstrate that integrating retrieval with physics
corpora can improve model performance, while also highlighting challenges that
motivate further research in retrieval-augmented physics reasoning.

### [141] [Making, not Taking, the Best of N](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00931)
*Ammar Khairi,Daniel D'souza,Marzieh Fadaee,Julia Kreutzer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fusion-of-N (FusioN) is a collaborative method that synthesizes the best elements from multiple LLM generations into a single high-quality output, outperforming traditional Best-of-N selection approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Best-of-N selection discards potentially useful information from diverse generations, treating the problem as zero-sum rather than collaborative.

Method: Uses a general LLM judge to synthesize the most informative elements from each sample in a pool of N generations into a single final answer.

Result: Consistently outperforms Best-of-N across 11 languages, 3 diverse tasks and varying model scales in both test-time scaling and synthetic data generation settings.

Conclusion: We should shift from monolithic quality measurement to embracing the polylithic nature of LLM generations, integrating diverse strengths to unlock latent potential.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality generations in modern LLMs has largely been framed as
a selection problem: identifying a single winning generation from a diverse
pool of N samples, the Best-of-N (BoN). Yet, this approach is inherently
zero-sum, discarding diverse and potentially useful information from the pool.
Instead, we explore a collaborative setup, where all candidates can potentially
contribute to the final winning generation. To this end, we propose Fusion-of-N
(FusioN): a method that uses a general LLM judge to synthesize the most
informative elements of each sample into a single final answer. We compare
FusioN to BoN in two settings, (i) test-time scaling, where we sample and
aggregate from a single model at test-time (ii) synthetic data generation,
where we fuse samples from a pool of diverse teachers to improve a student
model. We extensively benchmark both setups across 11 languages, 3 diverse
tasks and varying model scales. Across the bench, FusioN consistently
outperforms BoN showing versatility and robustness both in test-time scaling
and in downstream gains from synthetic data generation. We also perform
extensive analysis on FusioN, where it shows surprising strengths and
robustness under challenging settings. These results show that we should shift
how we think about evaluating and utilizing LLM generations from a monolithic
measure of quality, to embracing their polylithic nature. This shift allows us
to integrate diverse strengths, unlock latent potential, and achieve
improvements that were previously inaccessible through selection alone.

*Eileen Pan,Anna Seo Gyeong Choi,Maartje ter Hoeve,Skyler Seto,Allison Koenecke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show up to 20% accuracy reduction when processing non-standard American English dialects, with three specific grammar rules (existential "it", zero copula, and y'all) explaining most of the performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research has shown degraded LLM performance for under-represented English dialects, highlighting the need to understand how dialectal variations affect model performance.

Method: Analyzed the effects of converting "standard" American English questions into non-standard dialectal variants on multiple choice question answering tasks, and investigated the grammatical basis of performance differences.

Result: Found up to 20% reduction in accuracy for non-standard dialect questions, with three specific grammatical rules (existential "it", zero copula, and y'all) accounting for the majority of performance degradation across multiple dialects.

Conclusion: Calls for future work to develop bias mitigation methods focused on individual, high-impact grammatical structures rather than treating dialects as monolithic entities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are ubiquitous in modern day natural language
processing. However, previous work has shown degraded LLM performance for
under-represented English dialects. We analyze the effects of typifying
"standard" American English language questions as non-"standard" dialectal
variants on multiple choice question answering tasks and find up to a 20%
reduction in accuracy. Additionally, we investigate the grammatical basis of
under-performance in non-"standard" English questions. We find that individual
grammatical rules have varied effects on performance, but some are more
consequential than others: three specific grammar rules (existential "it", zero
copula, and y'all) can explain the majority of performance degradation observed
in multiple dialects. We call for future work to investigate bias mitigation
methods focused on individual, high-impact grammatical structures.

*Ruqian Zhang,Yijiao Zhang,Juan Shen,Zhongyi Zhu,Annie Qu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A syntax-guided diffusion language model that enhances text quality, diversity, and controllability by integrating structural supervision and personalized conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often produce generic text with insufficient structural diversity, limiting personalized expression. Diffusion models offer opportunities to improve language generation beyond autoregressive limitations.

Method: Proposes a cascaded framework that generates syntactic guidance before conditional text generation, and a noncascaded architecture for better structure-content alignment. Incorporates syntactic information and shared representation mechanism for fine-grained personalization.

Result: Extensive experiments show superiority in fluency, diversity, and stylistic fidelity. Qualitative analyses highlight interpretability and flexibility in learning personalized patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed syntax-guided diffusion model effectively enhances text generation quality, diversity, and controllability while supporting personalized expression and zero-shot inference.

Abstract: Large language models have made revolutionary progress in generating
human-like text, yet their outputs often tend to be generic, exhibiting
insufficient structural diversity, which limits personalized expression. Recent
advances in diffusion models have opened new opportunities for improving
language generation beyond the limitations of autoregressive paradigms. In this
work, we propose a syntax-guided diffusion language model that integrates
structural supervision and personalized conditioning to enhance text quality,
diversity, and controllability. We introduce a cascaded framework that
generates syntactic guidance before conditional text generation, and further
generalize it to a novel noncascaded architecture for better alignment between
structure and content. By incorporating syntactic information in the generating
process, the proposed model better captures the lexical and structural
characteristics of stylistic sentence construction. To enable fine-grained
personalization, we develop a shared representation mechanism that facilitates
information integration across users, supporting both faithful stylistic
generation and generalizable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments on
multiple tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in fluency,
diversity, and stylistic fidelity. Further qualitative analyses highlight its
interpretability and flexibility in learning personalized patterns.

TL;DR: This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of concept description methods for neural network components, covering generation techniques, evaluation metrics, datasets, and highlighting the need for more rigorous causal evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand neural network decision-making processes by uncovering mechanisms and identifying roles of individual components like neurons, attention heads, and sparse autoencoder features through natural language concept descriptions.

Method: Survey methodology that synthesizes existing research on concept description generation methods, evaluation metrics (both automated and human), and supporting datasets in the field of mechanistic interpretability.

Result: The survey reveals a rapidly growing field with evolving evaluation approaches and identifies a critical need for more rigorous, causal evaluation methods to improve model transparency.

Conclusion: This survey provides a comprehensive roadmap for future research in concept descriptions for model components, emphasizing the importance of advancing evaluation rigor to enhance neural network interpretability and transparency.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making processes of neural networks is a central
goal of mechanistic interpretability. In the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this involves uncovering the underlying mechanisms and identifying the
roles of individual model components such as neurons and attention heads, as
well as model abstractions such as the learned sparse features extracted by
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). A rapidly growing line of work tackles this
challenge by using powerful generator models to produce open-vocabulary,
natural language concept descriptions for these components. In this paper, we
provide the first survey of the emerging field of concept descriptions for
model components and abstractions. We chart the key methods for generating
these descriptions, the evolving landscape of automated and human metrics for
evaluating them, and the datasets that underpin this research. Our synthesis
reveals a growing demand for more rigorous, causal evaluation. By outlining the
state of the art and identifying key challenges, this survey provides a roadmap
for future research toward making models more transparent.

*Samin Mahdipour Aghabagher,Saeedeh Momtazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid DST model combining rule-based methods with language models (BERT, XGBoost, GPT) for Persian multi-turn dialogues, showing improved accuracy and coherence over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based DST is inefficient for open-domain multi-turn chatbots due to lack of adaptability and coherence for human-like experiences in complex conversations.

Method: Hybrid model using rule-based methods with BERT for slot filling and intent detection, XGBoost for intent validation, GPT for DST, and online agents for real-time answer generation.

Result: Significantly improved accuracy and coherence over existing methods in Persian-based chatbots, evaluated on a comprehensive Persian multi-turn dialogue dataset.

Conclusion: Hybrid approach effectively improves DST capabilities, enabling more customized, adaptable, and human-like conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is an essential element of conversational AI
with the objective of deeply understanding the conversation context and leading
it toward answering user requests. Due to high demands for open-domain and
multi-turn chatbots, the traditional rule-based DST is not efficient enough,
since it cannot provide the required adaptability and coherence for human-like
experiences in complex conversations. This study proposes a hybrid DST model
that utilizes rule-based methods along with language models, including BERT for
slot filling and intent detection, XGBoost for intent validation, GPT for DST,
and online agents for real-time answer generation. This model is uniquely
designed to be evaluated on a comprehensive Persian multi-turn dialogue dataset
and demonstrated significantly improved accuracy and coherence over existing
methods in Persian-based chatbots. The results demonstrate how effectively a
hybrid approach may improve DST capabilities, paving the way for conversational
AI systems that are more customized, adaptable, and human-like.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This systematic review examines ASR research for African languages, finding limited datasets, poor reproducibility, and inadequate evaluation metrics despite promising self-supervised learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: African low-resource languages are severely underrepresented in ASR research, creating barriers to digital inclusion across a continent with over 2000 languages.

Method: Conducted systematic literature review using PRISMA 2020 procedures, screening 71 studies from 2,062 records across multiple databases (DBLP, ACM, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, arXiv) from January 2020 to July 2025.

Result: Found 74 datasets across 111 African languages (~11,206 hours of speech), but fewer than 15% provided reproducible materials. Self-supervised learning shows promise but faces data limitations. Evaluation primarily uses WER with minimal linguistic metrics.

Conclusion: Sustainable ASR development for African languages requires stakeholder partnerships, ethical dataset creation, lightweight models, and active benchmarking, with community-driven initiatives showing potential for improvement.

Abstract: ASR has achieved remarkable global progress, yet African low-resource
languages remain rigorously underrepresented, producing barriers to digital
inclusion across the continent with more than +2000 languages. This systematic
literature review (SLR) explores research on ASR for African languages with a
focus on datasets, models and training methods, evaluation techniques,
challenges, and recommends future directions. We employ the PRISMA 2020
procedures and search DBLP, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, Semantic
Scholar, and arXiv for studies published between January 2020 and July 2025. We
include studies related to ASR datasets, models or metrics for African
languages, while excluding non-African, duplicates, and low-quality studies
(score <3/5). We screen 71 out of 2,062 records and we record a total of 74
datasets across 111 languages, encompassing approximately 11,206 hours of
speech. Fewer than 15% of research provided reproducible materials, and dataset
licensing is not clear. Self-supervised and transfer learning techniques are
promising, but are hindered by limited pre-training data, inadequate coverage
of dialects, and the availability of resources. Most of the researchers use
Word Error Rate (WER), with very minimal use of linguistically informed scores
such as Character Error Rate (CER) or Diacritic Error Rate (DER), and thus with
limited application in tonal and morphologically rich languages. The existing
evidence on ASR systems is inconsistent, hindered by issues like dataset
availability, poor annotations, licensing uncertainties, and limited
benchmarking. Nevertheless, the rise of community-driven initiatives and
methodological advancements indicates a pathway for improvement. Sustainable
development for this area will also include stakeholder partnership, creation
of ethically well-balanced datasets, use of lightweight modelling techniques,
and active benchmarking.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: mR3 is a massively multilingual reward reasoning model trained on 72 languages that achieves state-of-the-art performance on multilingual evaluation benchmarks while being significantly smaller than competing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM judges work well for English evaluation but don't generalize effectively to non-English settings, and there's limited understanding of what makes effective multilingual training for such evaluation models.

Method: Developed mR3 through comprehensive study of data and curriculum selection strategies, including integration of target-language reasoning datasets, trained on 72 languages with rubric-agnostic approach.

Result: Achieved SOTA performance on multilingual reward model benchmarks, outperforming much larger models like GPT-OSS-120B while being up to 9x smaller. Effectiveness confirmed through extensive ablation studies.

Conclusion: The approach successfully identifies effective strategies for building high-quality multilingual reward models, achieving broad language coverage and superior performance with smaller model size.

Abstract: Evaluation using Large Language Model (LLM) judges has been widely adopted in
English and shown to be effective for automatic evaluation. However, their
performance does not generalize well to non-English settings, and it remains
unclear what constitutes effective multilingual training for such judges. In
this paper, we introduce mR3, a massively multilingual, rubric-agnostic reward
reasoning model trained on 72 languages, achieving the broadest language
coverage in reward modeling to date. We present a comprehensive study of data
and curriculum selection for training to identify effective strategies and data
sources for building high-quality reward models, including the integration of
target-language reasoning datasets. Our approach attains state-of-the-art
performance on multilingual reward model benchmarks, surpassing much larger
models (i.e., GPT-OSS-120B) while being up to 9x smaller, and its effectiveness
is further confirmed through extensive ablation studies. Our models, data, and
code are available as open source at https://github.com/rubricreward/mr3.

### [149] [Pay-Per-Search Models are Abstention Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01152)
*Mustafa Omer Gul,Claire Cardie,Tanya Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MASH is a training framework that enables LLMs to recognize their knowledge boundaries and abstain from answering questions they cannot reliably answer, using search tool usage as a proxy for abstention through reinforcement learning with pay-per-search rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate answers to questions outside their knowledge boundaries, unlike humans who recognize their limitations and seek help or abstain. The goal is to teach LLMs similar behavior to improve reliability.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with a pay-per-search reward system, where external help-seeking (search tool use) serves as a proxy for abstention. The approach penalizes unnecessary searches while rewarding answer accuracy.

Result: MASH improves selective help-seeking performance by 7.6% on multi-hop datasets and demonstrates strong off-the-shelf abstention capabilities, distinguishing between answerable and unanswerable questions without requiring pre-defined knowledge boundaries.

Conclusion: MASH effectively aligns search tool use with parametric knowledge boundaries, enabling LLMs to make appropriate abstention decisions as a by-product of training for selective help-seeking, without needing explicit abstention training data.

Abstract: LLMs cannot reliably recognize their parametric knowledge boundaries and
often hallucinate answers to outside-of-boundary questions. In contrast, humans
recognize their limitations and can either seek external help for such
questions or abstain. In this paper, we introduce MASH (Modeling Abstention via
Selective Help-seeking), a training framework that readily extracts abstentions
from LLMs. Our key idea is that any external help-seeking by an LLM, i.e.
search tool use, can serve as a proxy for abstention if the external help
(search) is appropriately penalized while simultaneously rewarding answer
accuracy. MASH operationalizes this idea using reinforcement learning with a
pay-per-search reward.
  We run experiments on three knowledge-intensive QA datasets. Our results show
that MASH substantially improves upon the selective help-seeking performance of
prior efficient search approaches; on multi-hop datasets, MASH improves answer
accuracy by 7.6%. Furthermore, MASH demonstrates strong off-the-shelf
abstention -- it can distinguish between unanswerable/answerable questions and
selectively generate responses for answerable questions -- showcasing behavior
analogous to specialized abstention approaches. We emphasize that contrary to
prior abstention methods, MASH does not require pre-determining knowledge
boundaries to construct training data. Instead, MASH's abstentions are a
by-product of training for the auxiliary selective help-seeking task. Overall,
we show that MASH training effectively aligns search tool use with parametric
knowledge, which can be successfully leveraged for making abstention decisions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First systematic study of audio backdoor attacks against speech language models, showing high success rates across multiple tasks and proposing a fine-tuning-based defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs inherit vulnerabilities from their components, and there's a need to understand audio backdoor attacks in speech language models.

Method: Conducted systematic study across four speech encoders and three datasets, covering four tasks (ASR, speech emotion recognition, gender and age prediction). Performed component-wise analysis to identify vulnerable pipeline stages.

Result: Attack consistently achieved high success rates ranging from 90.76% to 99.41% across all tested configurations.

Conclusion: Proposed fine-tuning-based defense effectively mitigates the threat of poisoned pretrained encoders, addressing the vulnerability of multimodal LLMs to audio backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions are becoming
increasingly popular. One common approach to enable multimodality is to cascade
domain-specific encoders with an LLM, making the resulting model inherit
vulnerabilities from all of its components. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of audio backdoor attacks against speech language models. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across four speech encoders and three datasets,
covering four tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech emotion
recognition, and gender and age prediction. The attack consistently achieves
high success rates, ranging from 90.76% to 99.41%. To better understand how
backdoors propagate, we conduct a component-wise analysis to identify the most
vulnerable stages of the pipeline. Finally, we propose a fine-tuning-based
defense that mitigates the threat of poisoned pretrained encoders.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show poor social welfare allocation skills with strong utilitarian bias prioritizing efficiency over fairness, and their strategies are vulnerable to framing effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the principles and values that guide LLMs when distributing scarce societal resources, as they are increasingly used for high-stakes decisions affecting human welfare.

Method: Introduced the Social Welfare Function (SWF) Benchmark - a dynamic simulation environment where LLMs act as sovereign allocators distributing tasks to heterogeneous communities, creating trade-offs between efficiency (ROI) and fairness (Gini coefficient). Evaluated 20 state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: Three key findings: (1) General conversational ability poorly predicts allocation skill; (2) Most LLMs exhibit strong utilitarian orientation prioritizing productivity over equality; (3) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable to output-length constraints and social-influence framing.

Conclusion: Current LLMs pose risks as societal decision-makers, highlighting the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted alignment for AI governance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly entrusted with high-stakes
decisions that affect human welfare. However, the principles and values that
guide these models when distributing scarce societal resources remain largely
unexamined. To address this, we introduce the Social Welfare Function (SWF)
Benchmark, a dynamic simulation environment where an LLM acts as a sovereign
allocator, distributing tasks to a heterogeneous community of recipients. The
benchmark is designed to create a persistent trade-off between maximizing
collective efficiency (measured by Return on Investment) and ensuring
distributive fairness (measured by the Gini coefficient). We evaluate 20
state-of-the-art LLMs and present the first leaderboard for social welfare
allocation. Our findings reveal three key insights: (i) A model's general
conversational ability, as measured by popular leaderboards, is a poor
predictor of its allocation skill. (ii) Most LLMs exhibit a strong default
utilitarian orientation, prioritizing group productivity at the expense of
severe inequality. (iii) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable, easily
perturbed by output-length constraints and social-influence framing. These
results highlight the risks of deploying current LLMs as societal
decision-makers and underscore the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted
alignment for AI governance.

*Oussama Gabouj,Kamel Charaf,Ivan Zakazov,Nicolas Baldwin,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRAD is a dynamic demonstration generation method where LLMs are trained to create input-specific concise demonstrations, outperforming traditional RAG approaches under budget constraints and showing strong generalization to OOD domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG relies on static databases which constrain adaptability and can provide irrelevant demonstrations. There's a need for more dynamic, input-specific contextual support.

Method: Train an LLM to generate input-specific concise demonstrations. The approach limits both demonstration tokens and final output tokens under budget constraints. Smaller models generate demonstrations to guide larger target models.

Result: GRAD consistently outperforms strong baselines on Qwen2.5-14B across mathematical reasoning and advanced STEM questions. Shows robust generalization to OOD domains like physics, chemistry, and computer science. Reduces training costs while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: GRAD introduces a scalable demonstration generator model as the first step toward a dynamic few-shot learning paradigm in resource-constrained settings, offering better contextual support than traditional RAG.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks,
but their effectiveness often depends on the quality of the provided context.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches prompts with external
information, but its reliance on static databases constrains adaptability and
can result in irrelevant demonstrations. In this work, we propose a Generative
Retrieval-Aligned Demonstrator (GRAD), a dynamic demonstration-based approach
where an LLM model is trained to generate input-specific concise
demonstrations. By tailoring demonstrations to each input, our method offers
better contextual support than traditional RAG approaches. We demonstrate the
superiority of GRAD under budget constraints, where we limit both the number of
tokens used per demonstration and the number of tokens used for the final
output. Trained solely on a math dataset, GRAD consistently outperforms strong
baselines on Qwen2.5-14B across mathematical reasoning and advanced STEM
questions, highlighting GRAD's robust generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains such as physics, chemistry, and computer science. Furthermore, we
show that demonstrations generated by trained smaller models can effectively
guide larger target models, reducing training costs while maintaining
competitive accuracy. Overall, this work introduces a scalable demonstration
generator model presenting the first step toward a dynamic few-shot learning
paradigm in resource-constrained settings. We release the code used for the
project.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies typicality bias in preference data as a fundamental cause of mode collapse in LLM alignment, and introduces Verbalized Sampling, a training-free prompting method that significantly improves diversity across creative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address mode collapse in post-training alignment of LLMs, which reduces diversity, by identifying and solving the root cause at the data level rather than algorithmic limitations.

Method: Formalizes typicality bias theoretically, verifies it empirically on preference datasets, and introduces Verbalized Sampling - a prompting strategy that asks models to verbalize probability distributions over multiple responses.

Result: VS significantly improves diversity by 1.6-2.1x in creative writing, enhances performance across dialogue simulation, open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation without sacrificing factual accuracy and safety. More capable models benefit more from VS.

Conclusion: Provides a data-centric perspective on mode collapse and offers a practical inference-time solution that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity through Verbalized Sampling.

Abstract: Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon
known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to
algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level
driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically
favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive
psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference
datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse.
Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple,
training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the
model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g.,
``Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities'').
Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance
across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation,
open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual
accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity
by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that
more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new
data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy
that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.

### [154] [Energy-Regularized Sequential Model Editing on Hyperspheres](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01172)
*Qingyuan Liu,Jia-Chen Gu,Yunzhi Yao,Hong Wang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPHERE is a model editing method that uses hyperspherical energy regularization to stabilize neuron weight distributions during sequential updates, preventing catastrophic forgetting while enabling reliable knowledge editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models need constant updates to stay current, but sequential editing often causes catastrophic forgetting and destabilizes representations. The authors hypothesize that maintaining hyperspherical uniformity of neuron weights can help models remain stable while accommodating new knowledge.

Method: The method uses Hyperspherical Energy (HE) to quantify neuron uniformity during editing. SPHERE identifies a sparse space complementary to principal hyperspherical directions of pretrained weight matrices and projects new knowledge onto it, attenuating perturbations on principal directions to preserve prior knowledge.

Result: Experiments on LLaMA3 (8B) and Qwen2.5 (7B) show SPHERE outperforms the best baseline in editing capability by an average of 16.41% while most faithfully preserving general model performance.

Conclusion: SPHERE offers a principled path toward reliable large-scale knowledge editing by stabilizing neuron weight distributions through hyperspherical energy regularization, enabling models to retain prior knowledge while accommodating sequential updates.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require constant updates to remain aligned with
evolving real-world knowledge. Model editing offers a lightweight alternative
to retraining, but sequential editing often destabilizes representations and
induces catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we seek to better understand and
mitigate performance degradation caused by sequential editing. We hypothesize
that hyperspherical uniformity, a property that maintains uniform distribution
of neuron weights on a hypersphere, helps the model remain stable, retain prior
knowledge, while still accommodate new updates. We use Hyperspherical Energy
(HE) to quantify neuron uniformity during editing, and examine its correlation
with editing performance. Empirical studies across widely used editing methods
reveals a strong correlation between HE dynamics and editing performance, with
editing failures consistently coinciding with high HE fluctuations. We further
theoretically prove that HE dynamics impose a lower bound on the degradation of
pretrained knowledge, highlighting why HE stability is crucial for knowledge
retention. Motivated by these insights, we propose SPHERE (Sparse Projection
for Hyperspherical Energy-Regularized Editing), an HE-driven regularization
strategy that stabilizes neuron weight distributions, ultimately preserving
prior knowledge while enabling reliable sequential updates. Specifically,
SPHERE identifies a sparse space complementary to the principal hyperspherical
directions of the pretrained weight matrices and projects new knowledge onto
it, attenuating perturbations on the principal directions. Extensive
experiments on LLaMA3 (8B) and Qwen2.5 (7B) show that SPHERE outperforms the
best baseline in editing capability by an average of 16.41%, while most
faithfully preserving general model performance, thereby offering a principled
path toward reliable large-scale knowledge editing.

Conclusion: ToolBrain provides an effective, user-friendly framework that lowers barriers for adapting LLM-based agents to specific domains and improves tool-use capabilities efficiently.

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for agentic AI, yet training agents to
utilize tools remains challenging due to manually designed rewards, limited
training data, and poor multi-tool selection, resulting in slow adaptation,
wasted computational resources, and suboptimal performance. We introduce
ToolBrain, a lightweight and user-friendly framework for coaching tool use in
agentic models with flexible reinforcement learning (RL), easing the barriers
for researchers and practitioners to adapt LLM-based agents to specific
domains. It supports a wide range of training strategies, including RL
algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, as well as supervised learning. ToolBrain
enables custom reward callables directly on an agent's execution traces or
simply utilizes an automated LLM-as-a-judge system for reward generation. It is
packed with useful capabilities, including knowledge distillation from large to
small models for efficient development, automatic task generation from tool
descriptions, seamless tool retrieval, efficient fine-tuning pipelines with
QLoRA through Unsloth, and quantized inference via bitsandbytes. We demonstrate
ToolBrain through diverse use cases, such as training a CodeAct agent to
autonomously execute email search tasks, showing fast, targeted improvements
(up to 30.0%) in tool-use skills while keeping the codebase simple and
extensible in Agentic AI. Our framework is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning language models suffer from computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena, and existing methods struggle to balance reasoning quality with inference cost reduction.

Method: ARS uses adaptive certainty monitoring with multi-checkpoint certainty estimation and progressive suppression thresholds to dynamically suppress redundant reasoning steps without requiring additional training.

Result: ARS achieves up to 53% token reduction, 46.1% latency reduction, and 57.9% energy reduction across mathematical reasoning benchmarks while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: ARS provides an effective training-free solution for improving computational efficiency in large reasoning models by adaptively suppressing redundant reasoning steps through certainty monitoring.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant
computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient
reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with
inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression
(ARS)}, a novel training-free approach that dynamically suppresses redundant
reasoning steps while preserving accuracy through adaptive certainty
monitoring. ARS introduces a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism
with progressive suppression thresholds, achieving superior efficiency compared
to static suppression methods. Our extensive evaluation across mathematical
reasoning benchmarks using multiple model architectures demonstrates that ARS
achieves up to 53%, 46.1%, and 57.9% in token, latency and energy reduction,

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeurIPS should actively catalyze scientific consensus on AI policy by learning from IPCC's model, addressing the current void in consensus formation mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a complete void in consensus formation mechanisms for AI policy, and rigorous evidence-based policy design requires scientific consensus.

Method: Recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from IPCC's leadership in building scientific consensus on climate policy.

Result: Identifies NeurIPS as the best option for consensus formation due to its strengths and lack of compelling alternatives.

Conclusion: NeurIPS should champion scientific consensus to create higher quality AI policy, dispelling counters about researcher disagreement and policy engagement concerns.

Abstract: Designing wise AI policy is a grand challenge for society. To design such
policy, policymakers should place a premium on rigorous evidence and scientific
consensus. While several mechanisms exist for evidence generation, and nascent
mechanisms tackle evidence synthesis, we identify a complete void on consensus
formation. In this position paper, we argue NeurIPS should actively catalyze
scientific consensus on AI policy. Beyond identifying the current deficit in
consensus formation mechanisms, we argue that NeurIPS is the best option due
its strengths and the paucity of compelling alternatives. To make progress, we
recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from the IPCC's
leadership to build scientific consensus on climate policy. We dispel
predictable counters that AI researchers disagree too much to achieve consensus
and that policy engagement is not the business of NeurIPS. NeurIPS leads AI on
many fronts, and it should champion scientific consensus to create higher
quality AI policy.

### [160] [Judging by Appearances? Auditing and Intervening Vision-Language Models for Bail Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00088)
*Sagnik Basu,Shubham Prakash,Ashish Maruti Barge,Siddharth D Jaiswal,Abhisek Dash,Saptarshi Ghosh,Animesh Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper audits vision language models (VLMs) for bail decision prediction, finding they perform poorly and wrongly deny bail with high confidence. The authors develop interventions using RAG pipelines and fine-tuning to significantly improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of VLMs, legal judgment systems could potentially use criminal images alongside text data, but this raises concerns about misuse and unintended consequences. The authors want to investigate VLM efficiency in bail prediction.

Method: 1) Audit standalone VLMs on bail prediction, 2) Design interventions using RAG pipelines to include legal precedents, 3) Fine-tune VLMs with innovative schemes.

Result: Standalone VLMs perform poorly across intersectional groups and wrongly deny bail to deserving individuals with high confidence. The interventions substantially improve bail prediction performance.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the need for careful interventions on VLMs before real-world deployment in legal judgment prediction, and provides a framework for designing smarter interventions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used for legal judgment
prediction tasks based on case reports and crime history. However, with a surge
in the availability of large vision language models (VLMs), legal judgment
prediction systems can now be made to leverage the images of the criminals in
addition to the textual case reports/crime history. Applications built in this
way could lead to inadvertent consequences and be used with malicious intent.
In this work, we run an audit to investigate the efficiency of standalone VLMs
in the bail decision prediction task. We observe that the performance is poor
across multiple intersectional groups and models \textit{wrongly deny bail to
deserving individuals with very high confidence}. We design different
intervention algorithms by first including legal precedents through a RAG
pipeline and then fine-tuning the VLMs using innovative schemes. We demonstrate
that these interventions substantially improve the performance of bail
prediction. Our work paves the way for the design of smarter interventions on
VLMs in the future, before they can be deployed for real-world legal judgment
prediction.

Conclusion: Domain-specific reasoning and dataset construction are valuable for advancing robust financial fraud detection in real-world regulatory applications.

Abstract: Financial fraud detection in real-world scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the subtlety and dispersion of evidence across complex,
multi-year financial disclosures. In this work, we introduce a novel
multi-agent reasoning framework AuditAgent, enhanced with auditing domain
expertise, for fine-grained evidence chain localization in financial fraud
cases. Leveraging an expert-annotated dataset constructed from enforcement
documents and financial reports released by the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, our approach integrates subject-level risk priors, a hybrid
retrieval strategy, and specialized agent modules to efficiently identify and
aggregate cross-report evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially outperforms General-Purpose Agent paradigm in both recall
and interpretability, establishing a new benchmark for automated, transparent
financial forensics. Our results highlight the value of domain-specific
reasoning and dataset construction for advancing robust financial fraud
detection in practical, real-world regulatory applications.

TL;DR: Embodied AI with large visual language models enables autonomous drones to perform adaptive recovery and decision-making for safe landings in response to sudden events, overcoming limitations of hand-coded rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches using hand-coded recovery rules by safety engineers are incomplete and cannot anticipate the vast range of real-world contingencies that autonomous drones may encounter.

Method: Use embodied AI powered by large visual language models to provide commonsense reasoning for assessing context and generating appropriate actions in real time, demonstrated in a simulated urban benchmark in Unreal Engine.

Result: Drones can dynamically interpret their surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings, enabling adaptive recovery and decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand.

Conclusion: Embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and decision-making pipelines, advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.

Abstract: Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms,
faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and
adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers
hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate
the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete.
Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models,
provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate
actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban
benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their
surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show
that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and

Motivation: To integrate neural object-centric learning with symbolic reasoning for more interpretable and effective image classification, bridging the gap between neural networks and symbolic AI approaches.

Method: Combines neural Slot Attention component for object-centric learning with symbolic Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning, using feature combination strategies, casebase reduction, novel count-based partial orders, One-Vs-Rest strategy for multi-class classification, and Supported AA-CBR variant.

Result: Demonstrated effective classification performance on CLEVR-Hans datasets, showing competitive results compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: SAA-CBR successfully integrates neural and symbolic components for image classification, providing an effective neuro-symbolic approach that combines object-centric learning with interpretable reasoning.

a novel neuro-symbolic pipeline for image classification that integrates
object-centric learning via a neural Slot Attention (SA) component with
symbolic reasoning conducted by Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning
(AA-CBR). We explore novel integrations of AA-CBR with the neural component,
including feature combination strategies, casebase reduction via representative
samples, novel count-based partial orders, a One-Vs-Rest strategy for extending

*Anni Li,Aria Attar,Paul Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Thinkquel is a fine-tuned model that transforms natural language into reliable database queries using synthetic data and reinforcement learning to bridge token-level training with sequence-level execution rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language to SQL conversion faces challenges with schema linking, SQL dialect specificity, and misalignment between token-level training objectives and sequence-level execution supervision.

Method: Integrates TS-SQL synthetic data pipeline using dbt as portable intermediate representation and TS-GRPO reinforcement learning to align token-level training with sequence-level execution rewards.

Result: Achieves 93.2% execution success and 61.8% exact-result match on TS-SQL test set, improving base model by 67.2% and 44.4% respectively. TS-GRPO improves training stability and convergence speed.

Conclusion: Thinkquel demonstrates effective integration of synthetic data generation and reinforcement learning to produce robust, portable database queries with high execution success rates.

Abstract: Transforming natural-language requests into reliable, production-ready data
transformations remains challenging: correctness depends on precise schema
linking and warehouse-specific SQL dialects, while the strongest supervision
available during training--execution success and result matching--are provided
only at the sequence level. At the same time, assembling large,
execution-validated corpora is costly, and token-level objectives misalign with
these global signals, yielding unstable optimization and limited portability.
We introduce Thinkquel, a fine-tuned model for producing robust, portable, and
execution-validated database queries. Methodologies in Thinkquel integrates a
novel synthetic data pipeline, TS-SQL, that leverages dbt as a portable
intermediate representation with a span-aware reinforcement learning objective,
and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO), specifically designed to bridge the gap
between token-level training signals and sequence-level execution rewards when
finetuning LLMs. On the 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) reaches
93.2\% execution success and 61.8\% exact-result match with a two-stage SFT
curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2\% (exec.) and 44.4\% (match).
In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO increases training stability and speeds
convergence of the execution-match reward relative to GRPO and GSPO.

*Rohan Kadekodi,Zhan Jin,Keisuke Kamahori,Yile Gu,Sean Khatiri,Noah H. Bayindirli,Sergey Gorbunov,Baris Kasikci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces decoupled fine-tuning and DualTune framework to improve local LLMs' tool-calling performance by separating tool selection and argument generation into distinct subtasks with dedicated LoRA adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local LLMs consistently underperform frontier models in tool calling scenarios, struggling with tool selection from large sets and accurate argument generation for complex parameters, while privacy and cost concerns demand on-device inference capabilities.

Method: Proposes decoupled fine-tuning using LoRA adapters with separate loss masking for tool selection and argument generation subtasks, and DualTune inference framework that dynamically loads corresponding adapters and implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict tool selection scope.

Result: Qwen-2.5-7B model trained with decoupled fine-tuning improves tool calling accuracy by 46% over base model, outperforms similar-sized models in all cases and larger models (2x size) in most cases on MCP-Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: The decoupled approach effectively addresses local LLMs' limitations in tool calling, enabling privacy-preserving, cost-effective on-device agent orchestration with significantly improved performance.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has
revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving,
cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However,
local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool
calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and
accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a
methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:
tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a
novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated
LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using
separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present
DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using
decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of
local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation
step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the
corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune
implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required
for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that
the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool
calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local
reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases,
and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

*Maisha Maliha,Dean Hougen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAGIC-MASK is a multi-agent explainability framework that extends perturbation-based explanation to MARL using inter-agent collaboration, saliency-guided masking, and reward sharing to improve critical state discovery and learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current explainability methods for RL agents are limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to multi-agent settings, making deployment in safety-critical and multi-agent environments challenging.

Method: Integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration for sharing masked state information and peer experience. Uses saliency-guided masking and reward-based insights sharing.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy robustness on single-agent and multi-agent benchmarks including highway driving and Google Research Football.

Conclusion: MAGIC-MASK successfully generalizes explainability from single-agent to multi-agent systems through unified mathematical formalism, providing interpretable and transferable explanations while improving learning performance.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of Deep Reinforcement Learning
agents remains a key challenge for deploying these systems in safety-critical
and multi-agent environments. While prior explainability methods like
StateMask, have advanced the identification of critical states, they remain
limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to
multi-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
mathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent
Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that
extends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
Our method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy
exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state
information and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to
perform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,
reducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation
fidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of
our approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to
multi-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on
trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler
divergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable
explanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision
processes. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent
benchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google
Research Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy
robustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ICL guides improve task-specific performance but create 'optimized fragility' - enhancing simple tasks while degrading complex reasoning across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how ICL guides affect reasoning across different knowledge domains and understand cross-domain cognitive abilities in LLMs.

Method: Tested six GPT-OSS:20b variants (baseline + five ICL configurations) on 840 tests spanning general knowledge, logic riddles, and mathematical olympiad problems, using statistical analysis (ANOVA).

Result: ICL models achieved 91%-99% accuracy on general knowledge but dropped to 10-43% on riddles (vs 43% baseline). No significant difference on olympiad problem (p=0.2173). Significant behavioral modifications across ICL variants (p<0.001).

Conclusion: ICL guides create systematic trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

Abstract: ICL guides are known to improve task-specific performance, but their impact
on cross-domain cognitive abilities remains unexplored. This study examines how
ICL guides affect reasoning across different knowledge domains using six
variants of the GPT-OSS:20b model: one baseline model and five ICL
configurations (simple, chain-of-thought, random, appended text, and symbolic
language). The models were subjected to 840 tests spanning general knowledge
questions, logic riddles, and a mathematical olympiad problem. Statistical
analysis (ANOVA) revealed significant behavioral modifications (p less than
0.001) across ICL variants, demonstrating a phenomenon termed "optimized
fragility." ICL models achieved 91%-99% accuracy on general knowledge tasks
while showing degraded performance on complex reasoning problems, with accuracy
dropping to 10-43% on riddles compared to 43% for the baseline model. Notably,
no significant differences emerged on the olympiad problem (p=0.2173),
suggesting that complex mathematical reasoning remains unaffected by ICL
optimization. These findings indicate that ICL guides create systematic
trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important
implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

*Thierry Blankenstein,Jialin Yu,Zixuan Li,Vassilis Plachouras,Sunando Sengupta,Philip Torr,Yarin Gal,Alasdair Paren,Adel Bibi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents show systematic bias in selecting tools from marketplaces, preferring certain providers or earlier-listed tools, which creates fairness issues. Semantic alignment between queries and tool metadata drives this bias, and a lightweight mitigation approach is proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness concerns in LLM tool selection, where systematic bias can degrade user experience and distort competition by privileging some providers over others in marketplaces with functionally equivalent tools.

Method: Created a benchmark with diverse tool categories containing equivalent tools, tested seven models, conducted controlled experiments on tool features/metadata/pre-training exposure, and proposed a mitigation that filters candidates then samples uniformly.

Result: Found unfairness exists with models fixating on single providers or preferring earlier-listed tools; semantic alignment between queries and metadata is strongest predictor; perturbing descriptions shifts selections; repeated pre-training exposure amplifies bias.

Conclusion: Tool-selection bias is a key obstacle for fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs, and the proposed lightweight mitigation reduces bias while preserving task coverage.

Abstract: Agents backed by large language models (LLMs) often rely on external tools
drawn from marketplaces where multiple providers offer functionally equivalent
options. This raises a critical point concerning fairness: if selection is
systematically biased, it can degrade user experience and distort competition
by privileging some providers over others. We introduce a benchmark of diverse
tool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools, to
evaluate tool-selection bias. Using this benchmark, we test seven models and
show that unfairness exists with models either fixating on a single provider or
disproportionately preferring earlier-listed tools in context. To investigate
the origins of this bias, we conduct controlled experiments examining tool
features, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure.
We find that: (1) semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the
strongest predictor of choice; (2) perturbing descriptions significantly shifts
selections; and (3) repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint
amplifies bias. Finally, we propose a lightweight mitigation that first filters
the candidate tools to a relevant subset and then samples uniformly, reducing
bias while preserving good task coverage. Our findings highlight tool-selection
bias as a key obstacle for the fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs.

TL;DR: CAIA benchmark reveals AI models' critical vulnerability in adversarial environments - they achieve only 28% accuracy without tools and plateau at 67.4% with tools, showing systematic preference for unreliable sources over authoritative data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI benchmarks fail to evaluate performance in adversarial, high-stakes environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible, particularly relevant in domains like crypto markets where $30B was lost to exploits in 2024.

Method: Evaluated 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks in crypto markets, requiring agents to distinguish truth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information, and make irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.

Result: Models achieve only 28% accuracy without tools, improve to 67.4% with tools (vs 80% human baseline), but systematically prefer unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized misinformation even when correct answers are accessible.

Conclusion: Current models remain fundamentally unprepared for adversarial environments despite impressive reasoning scores, revealing foundational limitations in tool selection and adversarial robustness that must be addressed for trustworthy AI autonomy.

Abstract: We present CAIA, a benchmark exposing a critical blind spot in AI evaluation:
the inability of state-of-the-art models to operate in adversarial, high-stakes
environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible.
While existing benchmarks measure task completion in controlled settings,
real-world deployment demands resilience against active deception. Using crypto
markets as a testbed where $30 billion was lost to exploits in 2024, we
evaluate 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring agents to distinguish
truth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information landscapes, and make
irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.
  Our results reveal a fundamental capability gap: without tools, even frontier
models achieve only 28% accuracy on tasks junior analysts routinely handle.
Tool augmentation improves performance but plateaus at 67.4% versus 80% human
baseline, despite unlimited access to professional resources. Most critically,
we uncover a systematic tool selection catastrophe: models preferentially
choose unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized
misinformation and social media manipulation. This behavior persists even when
correct answers are directly accessible through specialized tools, suggesting
foundational limitations rather than knowledge gaps. We also find that Pass@k
metrics mask dangerous trial-and-error behavior for autonomous deployment.
  The implications extend beyond crypto to any domain with active adversaries,
e.g. cybersecurity, content moderation, etc. We release CAIA with contamination
controls and continuous updates, establishing adversarial robustness as a
necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy. The benchmark reveals that
current models, despite impressive reasoning scores, remain fundamentally
unprepared for environments where intelligence must survive active opposition.

*Renee Ge,Qianli Liao,Tomaso Poggio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Critical review of Hierarchical Reasoning Models for transformers, examining design choices and presenting variants that achieve significantly better performance on Sudoku-Extreme and Maze-Hard tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers excel at sequential tasks but struggle with logical reasoning, possibly due to limited exploration of creative uses like latent space and recurrent reasoning. Hierarchical Reasoning Models show promise but need deeper investigation.

Method: Performed critical review of Hierarchical Reasoning Models, examined key design choices, and developed intriguing variants of the models.

Result: Achieved significantly better performance on Sudoku-Extreme and Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported, with surprising observations emerging from the results.

Conclusion: The work raises intriguing directions for further research in transformer-based logical reasoning models and highlights the potential of recurrent reasoning in latent space.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language
processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential,
autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical
reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models,
but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as
latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction
is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et al., 2025), which introduces a
novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers,
achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite
the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls
for in-depth investigation. In this work, we perform a critical review on this
class of models, examine key design choices and present intriguing variants
that achieve significantly better performance on the Sudoku-Extreme and
Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported. Our results also raise surprising
observations and intriguing directions for further research.

*Kaiwen Yu,Mengying Sun,Zhijin Qin,Xiaodong Xu,Ping Yang,Yue Xiao,Gang Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A semantic-driven AI agent communication framework with three techniques: semantic adaptation transmission for environment adaptation, semantic lightweight transmission for model complexity reduction, and semantic self-evolution control for distributed hierarchical optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With communication targets shifting from humans to AI agents, semantic communication offers a solution but faces constraints from dynamic environments and limited resources in practical deployment.

Method: Proposes three enabling techniques: 1) Semantic adaptation transmission using fine-tuning with real/generative samples, 2) Semantic lightweight transmission using pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling, 3) Semantic self-evolution control using distributed hierarchical decision-making.

Result: Simulation results show faster convergence, stronger robustness, and the distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly outperforms conventional decision-making schemes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates potential for AI agent communication networks by addressing dynamic environment challenges and resource constraints through semantic-driven approaches.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are
shifting from humans to artificial intelligent (AI) agents, which require new
paradigms to enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration.
Semantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw
data, offers a promising solution. However, its practical deployment remains
constrained by dynamic environments and limited resources. To address these
issues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication
framework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation
transmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently
adapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission
incorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce
model complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third,
semantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical
decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust
multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that
the proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness,
while the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly
outperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential
for AI agent communication networks.

TL;DR: The TRACE framework enables dynamic evolution of agent benchmarks by transforming existing tasks into more complex versions through agent exploration, with validatable execution trajectories ensuring reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent benchmarks are quickly becoming obsolete as new agents rapidly achieve ceiling performance, creating a need for more challenging and sustainable evaluation systems.

Method: A three-stage framework: (1) evolutionary proposal mining through preliminary exploration, (2) problem formation and free exploration with trajectory recording, and (3) multi-level validation of evolved tasks and trajectories.

Result: Experiments on GAIA benchmark show TRACE consistently enhances task complexity while improving reliability through validatable execution trajectories.

Conclusion: TRACE represents a paradigm shift from static to dynamic, self-evolving evaluation systems, providing sustainable and challenging testing grounds for agent development.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have
empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing
agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly
developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent
abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based
Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE)
framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and
encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher
difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework
proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task
evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2)
problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into
feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while
recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which
ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible
trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE
framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability
of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a
paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic,
self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging
runway for agent development.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Automated evaluation of AI health question responses can closely match expert ratings when using clinician-authored reference answers, enabling scalable assessment of AI systems for patient communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gold standard evaluation using human expert review is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability for assessing AI systems that answer patient health questions.

Method: Conducted large systematic study across 100 patient cases with responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total), assessing three dimensions: question answering, clinical note evidence use, and medical knowledge application, using clinician-authored reference answers.

Result: Automated rankings closely matched expert ratings when using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics.

Conclusion: Carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI systems and support patient-clinician communication.

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but
selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard
for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human
expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated
metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often
context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of
AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we
conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient
cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them
along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2)
appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical
knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics,
automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that
carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI
systems and support patient-clinician communication.

### [174] [Expandable Decision-Making States for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning in Soccer Tactical Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00480)
*Kenjiro Ide,Taiga Someya,Kohei Kawaguchi,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EDMS is a novel state representation for soccer analysis that augments raw player data with tactical variables and uses action masking to create interpretable agent models with improved prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based soccer analysis is intuitive but limited, while modern ML models lack interpretability and explicit agent representations. There's a need for player-level models that are both tactically interpretable and robust across data sources.

Method: Proposed Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS) - semantically enriched state representation adding relational variables (space scoring, pass, score) to raw positions/velocities, combined with action masking for distinct on-ball/off-ball decision sets.

Result: EDMS with action masking consistently reduced action-prediction loss and TD error compared to baseline. Qualitative analysis showed it highlights high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns like fast counterattacks and defensive breakthroughs.

Conclusion: EDMS successfully creates interpretable agent models that map learned functions to human-understandable tactical concepts while maintaining compatibility with multiple datasets for reproducible cross-provider evaluation.

Abstract: Invasion team sports such as soccer produce a high-dimensional, strongly
coupled state space as many players continuously interact on a shared field,
challenging quantitative tactical analysis. Traditional rule-based analyses are
intuitive, while modern predictive machine learning models often perform
pattern-matching without explicit agent representations. The problem we address
is how to build player-level agent models from data, whose learned values and
policies are both tactically interpretable and robust across heterogeneous data
sources. Here, we propose Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS), a
semantically enriched state representation that augments raw positions and
velocities with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass, and score),
combined with an action-masking scheme that gives on-ball and off-ball agents
distinct decision sets. Compared to prior work, EDMS maps learned value
functions and action policies to human-interpretable tactical concepts (e.g.,
marking pressure, passing lanes, ball accessibility) instead of raw coordinate
features, and aligns agent choices with the rules of play. In the experiments,
EDMS with action masking consistently reduced both action-prediction loss and
temporal-difference (TD) error compared to the baseline. Qualitative case
studies and Q-value visualizations further indicate that EDMS highlights
high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns (e.g., fast counterattacks and
defensive breakthroughs). We also integrated our approach into an open-source
library and demonstrated compatibility with multiple commercial and open
datasets, enabling cross-provider evaluation and reproducible experiments.

TL;DR: Contrary to conventional wisdom, generative outcome reward models (GenORM) outperform process reward models (PRMs) across 14 diverse domains, challenging the assumption that fine-grained stepwise supervision is always better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the reliability of different reward model variants (ORM vs PRM, discriminative vs generative) across diverse domains, challenging the prevailing assumption that process reward models always outperform outcome reward models.

Method: Unified evaluation of four reward model variants (DisORM, DisPRM, GenORM, GenPRM) across 14 diverse domains, with theoretical analysis of error compounding in stepwise scoring and empirical validation.

Result: GenORM is the most robust model, yielding significant and consistent gains across all tested domains, while DisORM performs on par with DisPRM and GenPRM is not competitive.

Conclusion: Stepwise scoring in PRMs inherits label noise from LLM auto-labeling and struggles with long reasoning trajectories, supporting generative outcome verification as more effective for multi-domain deployment.

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling is
often assessed with \emph{external verifiers} or \emph{reward models} that
distinguish correct reasoning from flawed logic. Prior work generally assumes
that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning
step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final
answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent
domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants,
discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM
(\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not
competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding
significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this
to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM
auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories,
including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis
shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows,
and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge
the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and
support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment. We
publicly release our code, datasets, and checkpoints at
\href{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}{\underline{\small\texttt{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}}}

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VIRTUE is a visual-interactive text-image embedder that extends segmentation and vision-language models to enable region-specific embedding through visual prompts like points, boxes, and masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing embedding models lack visual-interactive capabilities to specify regions of interest, limiting their ability to handle localized user intent and learn entity-level information within images.

Method: VIRTUE integrates segmentation models to process visual prompts that pinpoint specific image regions, enabling precise handling of complex scenarios by combining segmentation and vision-language model capabilities.

Result: VIRTUE achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal MMEB tasks (3.1%-8.5%) and 5 visual-interactive SCaR tasks (15.2%-20.3%).

Conclusion: The proposed VIRTUE framework successfully extends embedding models with visual-interactive capabilities, enabling localized grounding of user intent and improved entity-level understanding in multimodal representation learning.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful
operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models
(VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following
capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive
capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding
box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their
human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual
interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of
user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn
entity-level information within images to complement their global
representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends
the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the
realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process
visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling
the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To
evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale
Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples
that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a
specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a
state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal
MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.

TL;DR: This study develops 15 data quality dimensions for RAG systems through interviews with IT practitioners, revealing the need for expanded DQ frameworks and front-loaded quality management strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data quality frameworks are inadequate for RAG systems as they were designed for static datasets, not dynamic multi-stage AI systems.

Method: Conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners from leading IT service companies and performed qualitative content analysis.

Result: Identified 15 distinct DQ dimensions across four RAG processing stages: data extraction, transformation, prompt & search, and generation.

Conclusion: RAG systems require new DQ dimensions, front-loaded quality management, and dynamic step-aware approaches due to the transformation and propagation of quality issues through the pipeline.

Abstract: Organizations increasingly adopt Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
enhance Large Language Models with enterprise-specific knowledge. However,
current data quality (DQ) frameworks have been primarily developed for static
datasets, and only inadequately address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG
systems. This study aims to develop DQ dimensions for this new type of AI-based
systems. We conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of leading
IT service companies. Through a qualitative content analysis, we inductively
derive 15 distinct DQ dimensions across the four processing stages of RAG
systems: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation.
Our findings reveal that (1) new dimensions have to be added to traditional DQ
frameworks to also cover RAG contexts; (2) these new dimensions are
concentrated in early RAG steps, suggesting the need for front-loaded quality
management strategies, and (3) DQ issues transform and propagate through the
RAG pipeline, necessitating a dynamic, step-aware approach to quality
management.

*Shojiro Yamabe,Jun Sakuma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Diffusion language models (DLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that exploit their iterative denoising process by injecting affirmative tokens for harmful queries, bypassing safety guardrails. The paper proposes a novel safety alignment method that trains DLMs to generate safe responses from contaminated intermediate states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit DLMs' parallel token generation through iterative denoising, which enables bidirectional conditioning but creates critical vulnerabilities.

Method: Proposed a novel safety alignment method specifically tailored for DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from contaminated intermediate states containing affirmative tokens for harmful queries.

Result: The proposed method significantly mitigates the vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance and improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks.

Conclusion: DLMs have critical vulnerabilities due to their iterative denoising process, requiring DLM-specific safety research and alignment methods to address jailbreak risks effectively.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through
iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional
conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit
this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that
DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising
process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows
that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate
step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in
aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can
readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed
on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method
tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from
contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our
experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the
vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method
improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work
underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.

*Minki Kang,Wei-Ning Chen,Dongge Han,Huseyin A. Inan,Lukas Wutschitz,Yanzhi Chen,Robert Sim,Saravan Rajmohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACON is a framework that compresses agent context (observations and interaction histories) using natural language compression guidelines optimized through failure analysis, reducing memory usage while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents in real-world environments face growing context lengths that increase costs and reduce efficiency in long-horizon tasks, while existing context compression methods are limited to single-step tasks or narrow applications.

Method: ACON uses compression guideline optimization in natural language space: analyzes failure cases where full context succeeds but compressed context fails, updates compression guidelines accordingly, and distills optimized LLM compressors into smaller models.

Result: Reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46% performance improvement.

Conclusion: ACON provides an effective framework for compressing agent context that maintains performance while significantly reducing memory overhead, and can be successfully distilled into smaller models for practical deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic,
real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective
tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,
as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This
expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior
work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow
applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified
framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and
interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON
leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given
paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,
capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is
updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM
compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.
Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON
reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task
performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller
compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%
performance improvement.

*Rosni Vasu,Peter Jansen,Pao Siangliulue,Cristina Sarasua,Abraham Bernstein,Peter Clark,Bhavana Dalvi Mishra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HARPA is an AI system that generates testable, literature-grounded scientific hypotheses by mining research trends, exploring design spaces, and converging on precise hypotheses. It outperforms baselines in feasibility and groundedness, and learns from experimental outcomes to improve hypothesis scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in automated scientific discovery where existing tools struggle to generate testable, literature-grounded hypotheses and lack adaptability to prior experimental outcomes.

Method: HARPA incorporates human researcher workflow: 1) identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, 2) explores hypothesis design spaces, 3) converges on precise hypotheses by identifying research gaps and justifying design choices, and 4) learns a reward model from experimental outcomes.

Result: HARPA-generated proposals perform comparably to baseline AI-researcher but achieve significant gains in feasibility (+0.78) and groundedness (+0.85). With CodeScientist agent, HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs 11) and fewer failures (16 vs 21). The reward model achieved ~28% absolute gain over untrained baseline.

Conclusion: HARPA represents a step forward in AI-driven scientific discovery by generating more feasible and grounded hypotheses that better translate to successful experimental execution.

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery
(ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools
to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific
literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior
experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by
incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first
identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores
hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses
by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations
show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform
comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative
dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve
significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness
(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the
ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11
out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert
feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to
simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what
hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA
learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental
outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained
baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field
of AI-driven scientific discovery.

### [181] [Is Model Editing Built on Sand? Revealing Its Illusory Success and Fragile Foundation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00625)
*Wei Liu,Haomei Xu,Bingqing Liu,Zhiying Deng,Haozhao Wang,Jun Wang,Ruixuan Li,Yee Whye Teh,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current model editing methods appear reliable but actually exploit hidden shortcuts rather than real semantic understanding, making them fragile to simple negation queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs encode outdated/incorrect knowledge that needs updating for alignment and safety, but current model editing approaches have fundamental flaws.

Method: Developed a systematic evaluation suite with negative examples to test model editing robustness, particularly using simple negation queries.

Result: State-of-the-art model editing approaches collapse under simple negation queries, revealing they rely on shortcuts rather than true semantic understanding.

Conclusion: Model editing is built on a fragile foundation and requires urgent reconsideration before meaningful advancements can be pursued.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect
knowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for
alignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has
emerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of
parameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other
knowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the
apparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current
literature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of
steering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would
encourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics.
This problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing
literature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with
robust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured
by evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover
it, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we
find that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation
queries. Our empirical evidence shows that editing is likely to be based on
shortcuts rather than full semantics, calling for an urgent reconsideration of
the very basis of model editing before further advancements can be meaningfully
pursued.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CDDM is a collaborative distillation method that creates lightweight diffusion models for real-time trajectory prediction, achieving 161x model compression and 31x acceleration while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show strong performance in trajectory prediction but have large model sizes and slow sampling, making them impractical for real-world deployment in autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems.

Method: Uses Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD) to transfer knowledge from teacher to student models, reducing both sampling steps and model size. Introduces dual-signal regularized distillation loss combining teacher guidance and ground-truth data.

Result: Achieves 96.2% ADE and 95.5% FDE performance retention on pedestrian trajectories with only 231K parameters and 2-4 sampling steps (161x compression, 31x acceleration, 9ms latency). State-of-the-art results on ETH-UCY and nuScenes benchmarks.

Conclusion: CDDM successfully bridges high-performing generative models with practical deployment constraints, enabling resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning
and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently
demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but
their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment.
This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel
method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon
Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers
knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student
model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size
across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is
further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and
ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust
performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the
nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the
baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while
requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x
compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further
show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent
behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing
generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables
resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS. Code is available

*Alessio Devoto,Maximilian Jeblick,Simon Jégou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Expected Attention is a training-free KV cache compression method that predicts future query attention to KV pairs, enabling efficient pruning without performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV cache memory consumption is a major bottleneck for LLM inference, and existing attention-score-based methods fail because future token attention scores are unavailable and modern implementations don't store full attention matrices.

Method: Uses distributional properties of LLM activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV pair, enabling principled ranking and pruning with minimal impact on the residual stream.

Result: Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prefilling and decoding phases, achieving effective compression without performance degradation.

Conclusion: The method provides practical KV cache compression and the authors release KVPress library with 20+ techniques for researchers to implement and benchmark compression methods.

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck
for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV
cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention
scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern
implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention
matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$
that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend
to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM
activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV
pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with
minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without
performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across
both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release
KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20
techniques}$.

*Chi-Huang Lin,Ting Han Wei,Chun-Jui Wang,Hung Guei,Chung-Chin Shih,Yun-Jui Tsai,I-Chen Wu,Ti-Rong Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an iterative method to reduce Relevance-Zone (RZ) sizes in game solving, which improves strategy reuse and pruning efficiency by gradually restricting search regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many games remain unsolved due to exponential game tree growth. While RZ technique reduces search space by focusing on relevant regions, different solutions create varying RZ sizes, and smaller RZs are preferred for better reuse and pruning.

Method: An iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves the same position while gradually restricting the search region. Includes three constraint generation strategies and integrates an RZ Pattern Table to leverage past solutions.

Result: In experiments on 7x7 Killall-Go, the method reduces average RZ size to 85.95% of the original. Reduced RZs can be stored as reusable knowledge.

Conclusion: The iterative RZ reduction method successfully creates smaller RZs, improving game solving efficiency and enabling reusable knowledge for larger board sizes and different openings.

Abstract: Game solving aims to find the optimal strategies for all players and
determine the theoretical outcome of a game. However, due to the exponential
growth of game trees, many games remain unsolved, even though methods like
AlphaZero have demonstrated super-human level in game playing. The
Relevance-Zone (RZ) is a local strategy reuse technique that restricts the
search to only the regions relevant to the outcome, significantly reducing the
search space. However, RZs are not unique. Different solutions may result in
RZs of varying sizes. Smaller RZs are generally more favorable, as they
increase the chance of reuse and improve pruning efficiency. To this end, we
propose an iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves the same
position while gradually restricting the region involved, guiding the solver
toward smaller RZs. We design three constraint generation strategies and
integrate an RZ Pattern Table to fully leverage past solutions. In experiments
on 7x7 Killall-Go, our method reduces the average RZ size to 85.95% of the
original. Furthermore, the reduced RZs can be permanently stored as reusable
knowledge for future solving tasks, especially for larger board sizes or
different openings.

*Yunhao Wang,Ziting Li,Shuai Chen,Tao Liu,Chao Song,Junjie Jiang,Jian Zhu,Peng Gao,Bin Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACPO is a novel reinforcement learning framework that improves vision-language model alignment through adaptive curriculum learning and advantage-aware clipping mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multimodal reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing policy optimization algorithms like PPO have limitations including static training schedules and rigid clipping mechanisms, which hinder effective alignment of large-scale vision-language models for complex reasoning tasks.

Method: ACPO uses a dual-component adaptive strategy: (1) dynamic curriculum that transitions from stable on-policy exploration to efficient off-policy exploitation by progressively increasing sample reuse, and (2) Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) that replaces fixed clipping with dynamic, sample-wise bounds based on normalized token advantages.

Result: Extensive experiments on MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro benchmarks show ACPO consistently outperforms strong baselines (DAPO, PAPO), achieving state-of-the-art performance, accelerated convergence, and superior training stability.

Conclusion: ACPO effectively addresses limitations of existing policy optimization methods through its adaptive curriculum and clipping mechanisms, demonstrating significant improvements in vision-language model alignment for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Aligning large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning via
reinforcement learning is often hampered by the limitations of existing policy
optimization algorithms, such as static training schedules and the rigid,
uniform clipping mechanism in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In this work,
we introduce Adaptive Curriculum Policy Optimization (ACPO), a novel framework
that addresses these challenges through a dual-component adaptive learning
strategy. First, ACPO employs a dynamic curriculum that orchestrates a
principled transition from a stable, near on-policy exploration phase to an
efficient, off-policy exploitation phase by progressively increasing sample
reuse. Second, we propose an Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) mechanism
that replaces the fixed clipping hyperparameter with dynamic, sample-wise
bounds modulated by the normalized advantage of each token. This allows for
more granular and robust policy updates, enabling larger gradients for
high-potential samples while safeguarding against destructive ones. We conduct
extensive experiments on a suite of challenging multimodal reasoning
benchmarks, including MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro. Results demonstrate
that ACPO consistently outperforms strong baselines such as DAPO and PAPO,
achieving state-of-the-art performance, accelerated convergence, and superior
training stability.

Motivation: Social media platforms provide insights into individuals' mental states, making them valuable for depression detection. There's a need for trustworthy and transparent AI systems that can provide interpretable predictions for mental health assessment.

Method: Hierarchical encoding of posts using unigrams and bigrams with attention mechanisms, incorporation of domain knowledge from a mental health knowledge graph via cross-attention, and ordinal regression framework for predicting depression severity levels.

Result: AttentionDep outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets while providing interpretable insights into predictions.

Conclusion: The work advances the development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health assessment from social media through domain-aware attention mechanisms and explainable predictions.

Abstract: In today's interconnected society, social media platforms provide a window
into individuals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states. This paper explores
the use of platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit for
depression severity detection. We propose AttentionDep, a domain-aware
attention model that drives explainable depression severity estimation by
fusing contextual and domain knowledge. Posts are encoded hierarchically using
unigrams and bigrams, with attention mechanisms highlighting clinically
relevant tokens. Domain knowledge from a curated mental health knowledge graph
is incorporated through a cross-attention mechanism, enriching the contextual
features. Finally, depression severity is predicted using an ordinal regression
framework that respects the clinical-relevance and natural ordering of severity
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that AttentionDep outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets, while
providing interpretable insights into its predictions. This work advances the
development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health
assessment from social media.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvolProver is a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover trained on augmented data from symmetry (EvolAST and EvolDomain) and difficulty (EvolDifficulty) perspectives, achieving new SOTA results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs for formal theorem proving lack generalizability and are fragile to minor transformations of problem statements, limiting their robustness.

Method: A data augmentation pipeline with three components: EvolAST (syntactic symmetry via AST transformations), EvolDomain (semantic symmetry via domain translation), and EvolDifficulty (generating theorems with varied difficulty).

Result: EvolProver achieves 53.8% pass@32 on FormalMATH-Lite, 69.8% on MiniF2F-Test, 52.2% on Ineq-Comp-Seed, and 34.0% on Ineq-Comp-Transformed, setting new SOTA records for non-reasoning models.

Conclusion: The proposed data augmentation pipeline effectively enhances model robustness, with EvolProver outperforming all comparable-sized models including reasoning-based ones.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for formal theorem proving have shown
significant promise, yet they often lack generalizability and are fragile to
even minor transformations of problem statements. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel data augmentation pipeline designed to enhance model
robustness from two perspectives: symmetry and difficulty. From the symmetry
perspective, we propose two complementary methods: EvolAST, an Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) based approach that targets syntactic symmetry to generate
semantically equivalent problem variants, and EvolDomain, which leverages LLMs
to address semantic symmetry by translating theorems across mathematical
domains. From the difficulty perspective, we propose EvolDifficulty, which uses
carefully designed evolutionary instructions to guide LLMs in generating new
theorems with a wider range of difficulty. We then use the evolved data to
train EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover. EvolProver
establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on FormalMATH-Lite with a 53.8%
pass@32 rate, surpassing all models of comparable size, including
reasoning-based models. It also sets new SOTA records for non-reasoning models
on MiniF2F-Test (69.8% pass@32), Ineq-Comp-Seed (52.2% pass@32), and
Ineq-Comp-Transformed (34.0% pass@32). Ablation studies further confirm our
data augmentation pipeline's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: DIA (DDIM Inversion Attack) is a defensive method that disrupts malicious image editing by attacking the DDIM inversion trajectory path, outperforming previous defense approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combat the malicious use of diffusion models for creating deepfakes and misinformation by developing a more effective defense that targets the DDIM inversion process used in real image editing.

Method: The proposed DIA attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path during the inversion process, disrupting the latent codes used for image editing.

Result: DIA effectively disrupts malicious image editing and surpasses previous defensive methods (AdvDM and Photoguard) across various editing techniques.

Conclusion: The framework provides practical defense against malicious AI use and can benefit both industry and research community in combating unethical content creation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown to be strong representation learners, showcasing
state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. Aside from accelerated
sampling, DDIM also enables the inversion of real images back to their latent
codes. A direct inheriting application of this inversion operation is real
image editing, where the inversion yields latent trajectories to be utilized
during the synthesis of the edited image. Unfortunately, this practical tool
has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake
contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive,
as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive
algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the
diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives
and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive
performance.In this work, we present the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) that
attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path. Our results support the effective
disruption, surpassing previous defensive methods across various editing
methods. We believe that our frameworks and results can provide practical
defense methods against the malicious use of AI for both the industry and the
research community. Our code is available here:

Method: Created ChemX datasets, conducted benchmarking study comparing existing agentic systems, introduced single-agent approach with controlled document preprocessing, and evaluated modern baselines like GPT-5.

Result: Empirical findings reveal persistent challenges in chemical information extraction, particularly with domain-specific terminology, complex tabular/schematic representations, and context-dependent ambiguities.

Conclusion: ChemX benchmark serves as a critical resource for advancing automated information extraction in chemistry and challenging existing methods' generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The emergence of agent-based systems represents a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, with growing applications in automated data
extraction. However, chemical information extraction remains a formidable
challenge due to the inherent heterogeneity of chemical data. Current
agent-based approaches, both general-purpose and domain-specific, exhibit
limited performance in this domain. To address this gap, we present ChemX, a
comprehensive collection of 10 manually curated and domain-expert-validated
datasets focusing on nanomaterials and small molecules. These datasets are
designed to rigorously evaluate and enhance automated extraction methodologies
in chemistry. To demonstrate their utility, we conduct an extensive
benchmarking study comparing existing state-of-the-art agentic systems such as
ChatGPT Agent and chemical-specific data extraction agents. Additionally, we
introduce our own single-agent approach that enables precise control over
document preprocessing prior to extraction. We further evaluate the performance
of modern baselines, such as GPT-5 and GPT-5 Thinking, to compare their
capabilities with agentic approaches. Our empirical findings reveal persistent
challenges in chemical information extraction, particularly in processing
domain-specific terminology, complex tabular and schematic representations, and
context-dependent ambiguities. The ChemX benchmark serves as a critical
resource for advancing automated information extraction in chemistry,
challenging the generalization capabilities of existing methods, and providing

*Nicholas Leisegang,Giovanni Casini,Thomas Meyer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Comparison between weighted knowledge bases (cost-based semantics) and c-representations for handling inconsistent knowledge bases, showing semantic equivalence under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare two different approaches for dealing with inconsistent knowledge bases in ontology-mediated data querying and non-monotonic reasoning.

Method: Semantic comparison by analyzing how both approaches assign numerical rankings/penalties to interpretations based on violated rules/conditionals.

Result: Showed that under certain conditions, both approaches can generate the same ordering on interpretations, establishing equivalence of semantic structures up to relative cost.

Conclusion: The equivalence results can benefit further work on both cost-based semantics and c-representations by enabling cross-fertilization between the two formalisms.

Abstract: Weighted-knowledge bases and cost-based semantics represent a recent
formalism introduced by Bienvenu et al. for Ontology Mediated Data Querying in
the case where a given knowledge base is inconsistent. This is done by adding a
weight to each statement in the knowledge base (KB), and then giving each DL
interpretation a cost based on how often it breaks rules in the KB. In this
paper we compare this approach with c-representations, a form of non-monotonic
reasoning originally introduced by Kern-Isberner. c-Representations describe a
means to interpret defeasible concept inclusions in the first-order case. This
is done by assigning a numerical ranking to each interpretations via penalties
for each violated conditional. We compare these two approaches on a semantic
level. In particular, we show that under certain conditions a weighted
knowledge base and a set of defeasible conditionals can generate the same
ordering on interpretations, and therefore an equivalence of semantic
structures up to relative cost. Moreover, we compare entailment described in
both cases, where certain notions are equivalently expressible in both
formalisms. Our results have the potential to benefit further work on both
cost-based semantics and c-representations

TL;DR: The paper formalizes a logic for unsupervised evaluation of classifiers by analyzing agreements and disagreements between experts, using linear programming to compute consistent group evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the asymmetry in utility between agreements and disagreements among experts, and develop a method for unsupervised evaluation without ground truth labels.

Method: Formalizes a logic using linear programming with integer constraints, incorporating logical constraints and axioms to compute consistent evaluations from observed agreements and disagreements.

Result: Developed a practical approach that can detect when LLMs-as-Judges violate minimum grading thresholds without requiring ground truth knowledge.

Conclusion: The method provides immediate utility for unsupervised evaluation through logical consistency checks, enabling detection of grading violations in AI systems.

Abstract: If two experts disagree on a test, we may conclude both cannot be 100 per
cent correct. But if they completely agree, no possible evaluation can be
excluded. This asymmetry in the utility of agreements versus disagreements is
explored here by formalizing a logic of unsupervised evaluation for
classifiers. Its core problem is computing the set of group evaluations that
are logically consistent with how we observe them agreeing and disagreeing in
their decisions. Statistical summaries of their aligned decisions are inputs
into a Linear Programming problem in the integer space of possible correct or
incorrect responses given true labels. Obvious logical constraints, such as,
the number of correct responses cannot exceed the number of observed responses,
are inequalities. But in addition, there are axioms, universally applicable
linear equalities that apply to all finite tests. The practical and immediate
utility of this approach to unsupervised evaluation using only logical
consistency is demonstrated by building no-knowledge alarms that can detect
when one or more LLMs-as-Judges are violating a minimum grading threshold
specified by the user.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing integration of distributed energy resources creates challenges for power system protection, as conventional fixed-threshold schemes cannot reliably handle dynamic grid conditions.

Method: Used classical machine learning models with voltage and current waveforms segmented into sliding windows (10-50ms), evaluated under realistic real-time constraints.

Result: Best fault classification model achieved F1 score of 0.992±0.001, best fault localization model reached R2 of 0.806±0.008 with mean processing time of 0.563ms.

Conclusion: Machine learning offers effective alternative to conventional protection schemes, with systematic benchmarking demonstrating high performance for fault classification and localization tasks.

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs),
particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system
protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being
among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed
thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the
increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning
(ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across
models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a
comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power
system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms
segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under
realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy,
robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model
achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2
of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently managing and utilizing the growing number of large language models remains challenging, requiring better ways to represent model capabilities for downstream tasks.

Method: Model probability of correct answers using item response theory with model ability vectors, query discrimination vectors, and difficulty scalars, learned via Mixture-of-Experts network.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction, with learned parameters encoding interpretable information.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively captures LLM capabilities and query characteristics, enabling efficient model management and utilization.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the number of large language models
(LLMs), yet efficiently managing and utilizing these vast resources remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we explore how to learn compact
representations of LLM abilities that can facilitate downstream tasks, such as
model routing and performance prediction on new benchmarks. We frame this
problem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer
a specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics,
we model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's
multi-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that
separates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To
learn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network
that couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both
model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates
that the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about
model capabilities and query characteristics.

Motivation: Organizations struggle to convert large volumes of collected data into actionable knowledge due to difficulties in processing and understanding complex data patterns.

Method: Uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to automatically identify data transformations and models that uncover interesting patterns in data.

Result: Evaluation with real-world and synthetic data shows AIDE effectively identifies data transformations and models that reveal interesting data patterns.

Conclusion: AIDE provides a robust, extensible foundation for automated knowledge discovery with potential for integrating additional pattern extraction strategies and domain knowledge.

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly focused on leveraging data from their
processes to gain insights and drive decision-making. However, converting this
data into actionable knowledge remains a difficult and time-consuming task.
There is often a gap between the volume of data collected and the ability to
process and understand it, which automated knowledge discovery aims to fill.
Automated knowledge discovery involves complex open problems, including
effectively navigating data, building models to extract implicit relationships,
and considering subjective goals and knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method for Automated Insights and Data Exploration (AIDE), that serves as
a robust foundation for tackling these challenges through the use of Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We evaluate AIDE using both real-world and synthetic
data, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying data transformations and
models that uncover interesting data patterns. Among its strengths, AIDE's
MCTS-based framework offers significant extensibility, allowing for future
integration of additional pattern extraction strategies and domain knowledge.
This makes AIDE a valuable step towards developing a comprehensive solution for
automated knowledge discovery.

### [198] [FusionAdapter for Few-Shot Relation Learning in Multimodal Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00894)
*Ran Liu,Yuan Fang,Xiaoli Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FusionAdapter is a novel method for few-shot relationship learning in Multimodal Knowledge Graphs that uses adapter modules and fusion strategies to effectively leverage complementary multimodal information while preserving modality-specific characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMKG methods align modalities into a shared space, which overlooks the distinct contributions of specific modalities and limits performance in low-resource settings. Different modalities for the same entity provide complementary and diverse information that should be preserved.

Method: Proposes FusionAdapter with: (1) adapter modules for efficient adaptation of each modality to unseen relations, and (2) fusion strategy that integrates multimodal entity representations while preserving diverse modality-specific characteristics.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. The approach improves generalization to novel relations with minimal supervision.

Conclusion: FusionAdapter effectively adapts and fuses information from diverse modalities, achieving better few-shot relationship learning in MMKGs by preserving modality-specific characteristics while enabling efficient adaptation to new relations.

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) incorporate various modalities, including
text and images, to enhance entity and relation representations. Notably,
different modalities for the same entity often present complementary and
diverse information. However, existing MMKG methods primarily align modalities
into a shared space, which tends to overlook the distinct contributions of
specific modalities, limiting their performance particularly in low-resource
settings. To address this challenge, we propose FusionAdapter for the learning
of few-shot relationships (FSRL) in MMKG. FusionAdapter introduces (1) an
adapter module that enables efficient adaptation of each modality to unseen
relations and (2) a fusion strategy that integrates multimodal entity
representations while preserving diverse modality-specific characteristics. By
effectively adapting and fusing information from diverse modalities,
FusionAdapter improves generalization to novel relations with minimal
supervision. Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets demonstrate
that FusionAdapter achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

*Shashank Reddy Chirra,Jayden Teoh,Praveen Paruchuri,Pradeep Varakantham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DAIL is a meta-learned adversarial imitation learning algorithm that discovers data-driven reward assignment functions through LLM-guided evolution, outperforming human-designed baselines and improving training stability across environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIL methods are unstable and rely heavily on human-designed reward assignment functions derived from divergence minimization objectives, overlooking the potential of data-driven approaches based on policy performance.

Method: Leverages an LLM-guided evolutionary framework to explore and discover reward assignment functions directly based on imitation policy performance, creating the first meta-learned AIL algorithm.

Result: DAIL generalizes across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms, outperforming state-of-the-art human-designed baselines and leading to more stable training.

Conclusion: The discovered reward assignment functions provide novel insights into AIL stability and demonstrate the effectiveness of data-driven approaches over human-designed solutions in imitation learning.

Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) methods, while effective in settings
with limited expert demonstrations, are often considered unstable. These
approaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR)
estimation $\frac{\rho_E}{\rho_{\pi}}$, where a discriminator estimates the
relative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert;
and Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward
signal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on
improving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing
training dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA
functions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives,
relying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a
different approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions,
i.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To
this end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently
explores the space of RA functions, yielding \emph{Discovered Adversarial
Imitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably,
DAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art of \emph{human-designed} baselines.
Finally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel
insights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL. Code is

*Yoonju Sim,Hyeonah Kim,Changhyun Kwon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes test-time search with stochasticity to enhance neural separation for CVRP, introducing stochastic edge selection and GraphCHiP algorithm to generate more diverse cuts including RCIs and FCIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based separation methods for CVRP produce fewer cuts than expected due to insufficient sensitivity to generate diverse subsets, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Introduces stochastic edge selection in graph coarsening and proposes GraphCHiP algorithm that leverages coarsening history to identify both rounded capacity inequalities (RCIs) and framed capacity inequalities (FCIs).

Result: Experiments show reduced dual gap compared to existing neural separation method and successful discovery of effective FCIs on specific instances.

Conclusion: Test-time search with stochasticity effectively enhances trained models' performance at inference time, enabling generation of more diverse and high-quality cuts for CVRP.

Abstract: The identification of valid inequalities, such as the rounded capacity
inequalities (RCIs), is a key component of cutting plane methods for the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). While a deep learning-based
separation method can learn to find high-quality cuts, our analysis reveals
that the model produces fewer cuts than expected because it is insufficiently
sensitive to generate a diverse set of generated subsets. This paper proposes
an alternative: enhancing the performance of a trained model at inference time
through a new test-time search with stochasticity. First, we introduce
stochastic edge selection into the graph coarsening procedure, replacing the
previously proposed greedy approach. Second, we propose the Graph Coarsening
History-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm, which leverages coarsening
history to identify not only RCIs but also, for the first time, the Framed
capacity inequalities (FCIs). Experiments on randomly generated CVRP instances
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the dual gap compared
to the existing neural separation method. Additionally, our method discovers
effective FCIs on a specific instance, despite the challenging nature of
identifying such cuts.

*Cong Yu,Valter Uotila,Shilong Deng,Qingyuan Wu,Tuo Shi,Songlin Jiang,Lei You,Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QUASAR is an agentic RL framework that uses tool-augmented LLMs to generate and optimize quantum circuits, addressing challenges in parameter precision and domain knowledge through quantum circuit verification and hierarchical rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based quantum circuit generation faces challenges with precise parameter values for quantum gates and lacks quantum domain-specific knowledge, leading to low-quality or incorrect circuits.

Method: QUASAR combines reinforcement learning with tool-augmented LLMs, using quantum circuit verification with external simulators and a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism during RL training.

Result: QUASAR achieved 99.31% validity in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10, outperforming GPT-4o, GPT-5, DeepSeek-V3, and other baselines when augmenting a 4B LLM.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully improves both syntax and semantic performance of generated quantum circuits by aligning LLMs with quantum-specific knowledge through verification and reward mechanisms.

Abstract: Designing and optimizing task-specific quantum circuits are crucial to
leverage the advantage of quantum computing. Recent large language model
(LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic
solution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i)
parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal
performance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of
quantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii)
LLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack
of quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and
optimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with
quantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR
designs (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum
simulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL
training. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic
performance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR
has achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10,
outperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several
supervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AFFR framework combines few-shot federated optimization, energy-aware client scheduling, and secure aggregation for rare-disease diagnosis, achieving 10% accuracy improvement and 50% reduction in client dropouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in rare-disease diagnosis including data scarcity, privacy concerns, and limited edge device resources in clinical settings.

Method: Integrates three components: few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning, energy-aware client scheduling, and secure aggregation with calibrated differential privacy.

Result: 10% improvement in accuracy compared to baseline FL, over 50% reduction in client dropouts without degrading convergence, and acceptable privacy-utility trade-offs.

Conclusion: AFFR provides a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy federated diagnosis of rare conditions in real-world clinical networks.

Abstract: Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital
health, hindered by extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the limited
resources of edge devices. This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot
Rare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i)
few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited
patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device
dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with
calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike
prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a
modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental
evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10%
improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client
dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore,
privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These
findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy
federated diagnosis of rare conditions.

*Saravanan Venkatachalam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A unified framework for after-sales demand forecasting combining statistical, ML, and deep learning models with role-driven analytics, incorporating exogenous signals and COVID-19 regime handling, plus LLM-generated narratives for decision support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a practical system that bridges forecasting accuracy with actionable business insights, enabling planners to move beyond current accuracy assessment to proactive decision-making and trend analysis.

Method: Revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble modeling with Pareto segmentation, horizon-aware ensembling, exogenous signal integration, COVID-19 regime treatment, and LLM-powered analytics layer for automated reporting and narratives.

Result: Country-part forecasts with calibrated intervals, performance scorecards with bias decomposition, trend analysis with change point detection, and automated narrative generation for planners across 90+ countries and 6,000 parts.

Conclusion: The system successfully closes the loop between forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions by providing reproducible workflows and actionable insights that help planners focus on future accuracy trends and strategic levers.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical architecture for after-sales demand
forecasting and monitoring that unifies a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble
of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models with a role-driven
analytics layer for scorecards and trend diagnostics. The framework ingests
exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle,
seasonality) and treats COVID-19 as a distinct regime, producing country-part
forecasts with calibrated intervals. A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts
high-revenue items individually and pools the long tail via clusters, while
horizon-aware ensembling aligns weights with business-relevant losses (e.g.,
WMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard delivers decision-focused
insights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue share and count, bias
decomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and product-family
hotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country pairs. A
trend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent months,
flags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points
aligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal
factors. LLMs are embedded in the analytics layer to generate role-aware
narratives and enforce reporting contracts. They standardize business
definitions, automate quality checks and reconciliations, and translate
quantitative results into concise, explainable summaries for planners and
executives. The system exposes a reproducible workflow -- request
specification, model execution, database-backed artifacts, and AI-generated
narratives -- so planners can move from "How accurate are we now?" to "Where is
accuracy heading and which levers should we pull?", closing the loop between
forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions across more than 90 countries
and about 6,000 parts.

TL;DR: SMDS is a model-agnostic method that automatically discovers feature manifolds in language models, revealing various geometric structures like circles, lines, and clusters that reflect concept properties and support reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for discovering concept geometries in language models were limited to specific features and lacked generalization, motivating the need for a more comprehensive approach.

Method: Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS) - a model-agnostic method to automatically discover feature manifolds in language models' latent spaces.

Result: SMDS revealed that different features form various geometric structures (circles, lines, clusters) that consistently reflect concept properties, are stable across models, support reasoning, and dynamically reshape with context.

Conclusion: Feature manifolds play a functional role in entity-based reasoning, supporting a model where language models encode and transform structured representations.

Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode
concepts as directions in their latent space, forming organized,
multidimensional manifolds. Prior efforts focus on discovering specific
geometries for specific features, and thus lack generalization. We introduce
Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic method to
automatically discover feature manifolds. We apply SMDS to temporal reasoning
as a case study, finding that different features form various geometric
structures such as circles, lines, and clusters. SMDS reveals many insights on
these structures: they consistently reflect the properties of the concepts they
represent; are stable across model families and sizes; actively support
reasoning in models; and dynamically reshape in response to context changes.
Together, our findings shed light on the functional role of feature manifolds,
supporting a model of entity-based reasoning in which LMs encode and transform
structured representations.

*Zach Studdiford,Timothy T. Rogers,Kushin Mukherjee,Siddharth Suresh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates 70+ LLMs on human conceptual representation alignment using triplet similarity tasks, finding that instruction-finetuning and larger attention head dimensionality improve human-AI alignment, while current benchmarks inadequately capture this alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify which computational ingredients (architectures, fine-tuning methods, training datasets) are most crucial for developing human-like representations in LLMs, and to address the limitation that current benchmarks don't effectively measure representational alignment between humans and models.

Method: Evaluated over 70 models varying in computational ingredients on a triplet similarity task using concepts from THINGS database, comparing human and model representations, and correlating alignment scores with existing benchmark scores.

Result: Instruction-finetuned models and those with larger attention head dimensionality showed highest human alignment. Multimodal pretraining and parameter size had limited impact. Existing benchmarks like MMLU capture alignment better than MUSR, but none fully account for alignment variance.

Conclusion: Instruction-finetuning and attention head dimensionality are key for human-AI representational alignment, and current benchmarks are insufficient for measuring this alignment, highlighting a gap in LLM evaluation.

Abstract: The ability to translate diverse patterns of inputs into structured patterns
of behavior has been thought to rest on both humans' and machines' ability to
learn robust representations of relevant concepts. The rapid advancement of
transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a diversity of
computational ingredients -- architectures, fine tuning methods, and training
datasets among others -- but it remains unclear which of these ingredients are
most crucial for building models that develop human-like representations.
Further, most current LLM benchmarks are not suited to measuring
representational alignment between humans and models, making benchmark scores
unreliable for assessing if current LLMs are making progress towards becoming
useful cognitive models. We address these limitations by first evaluating a set
of over 70 models that widely vary in their computational ingredients on a
triplet similarity task, a method well established in the cognitive sciences
for measuring human conceptual representations, using concepts from the THINGS
database. Comparing human and model representations, we find that models that
undergo instruction-finetuning and which have larger dimensionality of
attention heads are among the most human aligned, while multimodal pretraining
and parameter size have limited bearing on alignment. Correlations between
alignment scores and scores on existing benchmarks reveal that while some
benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) are better suited than others (e.g., MUSR) for
capturing representational alignment, no existing benchmark is capable of fully
accounting for the variance of alignment scores, demonstrating their
insufficiency in capturing human-AI alignment. Taken together, our findings
help highlight the computational ingredients most essential for advancing LLMs
towards models of human conceptual representation and address a key
benchmarking gap in LLM evaluation.

*Akchunya Chanchal,David A. Kelly,Hana Chockler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Activation-Deactivation (AD) paradigm and ConvAD mechanism for more robust black-box explanations of CNN image classifiers by deactivating model parts instead of occluding inputs, avoiding out-of-distribution issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current black-box explainability methods rely on occluding input parts, creating out-of-distribution images and requiring domain knowledge for occlusion value selection, which raises doubts about explanation quality.

Method: Proposes Activation-Deactivation (AD) paradigm that removes effects of occluded features by switching off corresponding model parts. Introduces ConvAD as a drop-in mechanism for CNNs that implements AD without additional training.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows AD explanations achieve up to 62.5% improvement in robustness compared to occlusion-based methods, with consistent improvements across datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: ConvAD provides more robust explanations without requiring domain knowledge or additional training, and preserves the original decision-making process of the network.

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the
decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their
reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to
out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the
explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires
domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm
Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input
features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the
model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in
mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust
explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the
ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We
provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model
architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations
achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,
and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of
AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with
occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without
the need for domain knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem of unfaithful rationales in Chain-of-Thought prompting despite enhanced reasoning capabilities, aiming for formal verification beyond heuristic interpretability.

Method: Extract and map informal CoT natural language steps into formal typed proof structures using Curry-Howard correspondence, treating faithful reasoning as well-typed programs.

Result: Successfully converting CoT traces into well-typed proofs serves as verifiable certificates of computational faithfulness.

Conclusion: Framework transforms narrative explanations into formally verifiable programs, providing path to more reliable and trustworthy AI systems through formal verification.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an
open problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens
for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a
direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this
paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program,
where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We
operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the
informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure.
Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong,
verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond
heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides
a methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally
verifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and
trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: SIRL uses LLMs' internal safety instincts as self-generated rewards to improve alignment without external validators, achieving high defense rates against jailbreaks while maintaining performance on other tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM safety is challenging due to lack of universal standards and reliable content validators, making effective training signals difficult to obtain.

Method: Safety Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL) transforms models' internal confidence into self-generated reward signals, teaching models to trust their safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors.

Result: SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates against 20+ jailbreak methods using only 15,000 unlabeled prompts, surpassing resource-intensive supervised methods while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Effective alignment can emerge from within models' internal safety beliefs, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that scale without extensive human oversight.

Abstract: Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the
absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it
difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models
already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce
high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when
generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped
signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety
Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal
confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on
external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their
safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on
Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against
20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only
15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods
while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation
benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from
within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that
scale without extensive human oversight.

TL;DR: A two-layer human-centric production planning framework combining CP for order-line scheduling and MDP for worker-line allocation to optimize both efficiency and workforce fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for industrial manufacturing systems that optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness by integrating human factors into production planning.

Method: Two-layer framework: 1) Order-Line allocation using Constraint Programming for production scheduling; 2) Worker-Line allocation using Markov Decision Process with three solution strategies (greedy, MCTS, RL) considering worker preferences, experience, resilience, and medical constraints.

Result: CP-based scheduling produces compact, feasible plans with low tardiness; MDP-based worker allocation significantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baselines. Validated through 16 test sessions with automotive industry experts.

Conclusion: Combining CP with learning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric production planning that simultaneously optimizes throughput and workforce well-being in industrial settings.

Abstract: This work presents a two-layer, human-centric production planning framework
designed to optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness in
industrial manufacturing. The first layer formulates the Order-Line allocation
as a Constraint Programming (CP) problem, generating high-utilization
production schedules that respect machine capacities, processing times, and due
dates. The second layer models Worker-Line allocation as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP), integrating human factors such as worker preference, experience,
resilience, and medical constraints into the assignment process. Three solution
strategies, greedy allocation, MCTS, and RL, are implemented and compared
across multiple evaluation scenarios. The proposed system is validated through
16 test sessions with domain experts from the automotive industry, combining
quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs) with expert ratings. Results
indicate that the CP-based scheduling approach produces compact, feasible
production plans with low tardiness, while the MDP-based worker allocation
significantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baseline
approaches. Domain experts rated both the Order-Line and Worker-Line components
as effective and highlighted opportunities to further refine the objective
function to penalize excessive earliness and improve continuity in worker
assignments. Overall, the findings demonstrate that combining CP with
learning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric
production planning. The approach enables simultaneous optimization of
throughput and workforce well-being, offering a practical foundation for fair
and efficient manufacturing scheduling in industrial settings.

TL;DR: PRISM-Consult is a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain specialists for emergency department consultations, achieving efficient routing and compute savings while maintaining safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a practical framework for safe, auditable, and low-latency clinical consultations at scale by extending a compact sequence model into specialized domain experts.

Method: Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a light-weight router reads initial tokens and dispatches to specialist models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal, Psychogenic) that inherit PRISM's small transformer backbone and token template for parameter efficiency.

Result: Specialists exhibit smooth convergence with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a safety-first policy.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical path to clinical deployment with validation steps including external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat thresholds, and multi-label arbitration to meet prospective clinical standards.

Abstract: We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture
that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain
specialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a
light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist
models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal,
Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and
token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On
real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence
with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves
high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a
safety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs. conclusive
ICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain

path to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline
validation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat
thresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment
standards.

*Evan Heus,Rick Bookstaber,Dhruv Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM-centric agent framework for supply chain risk analysis that treats supply chains as knowledge graphs, uses network centrality for retrieval, and employs context shells to make quantitative data intelligible to LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex multi-modal financial risk data, standard RAG oversimplifies relationships, and specialist models are costly and static.

Method: Treat supply chain as knowledge graph, use graph traverser guided by network centrality scores, orchestrate graph retrieval with numerical data and news streams, employ context shells to embed raw figures in natural language.

Result: Enables generation of concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time without costly fine-tuning or dedicated graph database.

Conclusion: Lightweight approach successfully bridges the gap between LLMs and complex financial risk analysis using network science principles and natural language context shells.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and
network-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are
costly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for
supply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent
duality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain
network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for
retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently
extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture
orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables
and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive
templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative
data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model
to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time
without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.

TL;DR: Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker is a 15B parameter multimodal reasoning model that achieves frontier performance through progressive three-stage training design rather than large scale, matching larger models while being deployable on single GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that frontier-level multimodal reasoning can be achieved through thoughtful training design rather than massive scale, making advanced AI accessible to organizations with limited computational resources.

Method: Progressive three-stage methodology: (1) depth upscaling from Pixtral-12B, (2) staged continual pre-training with synthetic data for visual reasoning, and (3) high-quality text-only supervised fine-tuning with explicit reasoning traces.

Result: Achieves score of 52 on Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index (matching DeepSeek-R1-0528) and within 5 points of Gemini-2.5-Flash and Claude Sonnet-3.7 across ten image benchmarks, all without reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Thoughtful mid-training design can close substantial capability gaps without massive scale, making frontier multimodal reasoning accessible to organizations with limited infrastructure.

Abstract: We present Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter open-weights
multimodal reasoning model that achieves frontier-level performance through
training design rather than sheer scale. Starting from Pixtral-12B, we apply a
progressive three-stage methodology: (1) depth upscaling to expand reasoning
capacity without pretraining from scratch, (2) staged continual pre-training
that first develops foundational text and vision understanding, then enhances
visual reasoning through targeted synthetic data generation addressing spatial
structure, compositional understanding, and fine-grained perception, and (3)
high-quality text-only supervised fine-tuning on curated instruction-response
pairs with explicit reasoning traces spanning mathematics, coding, science, and
tool use. Notably, our model achieves competitive results without reinforcement
learning or preference optimization, isolating the contribution of our
data-centric continual pre-training approach. On the Artificial Analysis
Intelligence Index, Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker attains a score of 52, matching
DeepSeek-R1-0528 despite requiring significantly fewer computational resources.
Across ten image benchmarks, its performance is on average within five points
of Gemini-2.5-Flash and Claude Sonnet-3.7, a key achievement for a model
operating within single-GPU deployment constraints. Our results demonstrate
that thoughtful mid-training 2 design can close substantial capability gaps
without massive scale, making frontier-level multimodal reasoning accessible to
organizations with limited infrastructure. We release the model checkpoint, all
training recipes, and evaluation protocols under the MIT license to to advance
open-source research.

### [214] [Generalized Parallel Scaling with Interdependent Generations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01143)
*Harry Dong,David Brandfonbrener,Eryk Helenowski,Yun He,Mrinal Kumar,Han Fang,Yuejie Chi,Karthik Abinav Sankararaman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bridge enables parallel LLM inference by generating interdependent responses that share information, improving quality and consistency compared to independent generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parallel LLM inference generates responses independently, wasting computational resources and missing opportunities to leverage information across different responses.

Method: Bridge treats batched LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices, using only 2.8%-5.1% new parameters to create interdependent parallel responses.

Result: Bridge improves relative mean accuracy gains from reinforcement learning by up to 50%, boosts consistency of correct responses, and scales to any generation width with better performance than independent generations.

Conclusion: Bridge unlocks a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages information between sequences and is compatible with any post-generation aggregation technique.

Abstract: Parallel LLM inference scaling involves sampling a set of $N>1$ responses for
a single input prompt. However, these $N$ parallel responses tend to be
generated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and
leaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others.
This is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used
in all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose
Bridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched
LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only
a small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean
accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50%
and boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any
generation width, all with greater performance than independent generations,
unlocking a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages
information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation
technique.
