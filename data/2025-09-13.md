*Davide Caffagni,Sara Sarto,Marcella Cornia,Lorenzo Baraldi,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReT-2 is a unified multimodal retrieval model that handles both image and text queries to search across multimodal document collections, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval methods are limited to single-modality queries or documents and require task-specific fine-tuning, while complex multimodal retrieval tasks are emerging with the advancement of multimodal LLMs.

Method: ReT-2 uses multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details.

Result: ReT-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different retrieval configurations, with faster inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. It also improves downstream performance when integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines.

Conclusion: ReT-2 provides an effective unified solution for multimodal retrieval that supports complex queries and documents containing both images and text, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency while being publicly available.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

### [2] [Diffusion-Based Action Recognition Generalizes to Untrained Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08908)
*Rogerio Guimaraes,Frank Xiao,Pietro Perona,Markus Marks*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using Vision Diffusion Model features with transformer aggregation achieves human-like action recognition across species, viewpoints, and contexts, setting new SOTA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can recognize actions despite large variations in context and viewpoint, but current deep learning models struggle with such generalization.

Method: Propose using features from Vision Diffusion Model (VDM) aggregated via transformer, enhanced by conditioning on earlier diffusion timesteps to prioritize semantic over pixel-level information.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art across three generalization benchmarks: action classification across animal species, different viewing angles, and different recording contexts.

Conclusion: This approach brings machine action recognition closer to human-like robustness by leveraging diffusion model features for better generalization.

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

*Waqar Ahmad,Evan Murphy,Vladimir A. Krylov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Beta-SOD: A novel Beta mixture similarity-based outlier detection framework for robust object re-identification that handles label noise by modeling pairwise similarity distributions and combining multiple loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object re-identification methods are highly sensitive to label noise, which causes significant performance degradation. Existing approaches lack robust mechanisms to handle noisy labels in Re-ID tasks.

Method: Reframes Re-ID as supervised image similarity using Siamese network. Introduces Beta-SOD framework with two-component Beta distribution mixture model for outlier detection. Combines binary cross-entropy, contrastive, and cosine embedding losses for joint optimization.

Result: Superior performance on CUHK03, Market-1501 (person Re-ID) and VeRi-776 (vehicle Re-ID) datasets across 10-30% noise levels. Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in denoising and Re-ID tasks.

Conclusion: Beta-SOD provides an effective solution for noisy Re-ID scenarios with proven identifiability, robustness, and broad applicability across different object types and noise levels.

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

*Nan Mu,Ruiqi Song,Zhihui Xu,Jingfeng Jiang,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFD-Mamba2Net improves coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images using multi-scale structural priors, state-space modeling, and frequency-domain enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary Artery Disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and existing ICA image analysis methods struggle with low contrast, high noise, and complex vascular structures, limiting clinical adoption.

Method: End-to-end framework with Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement module in encoder to highlight vascular structures, and Progressive High-Frequency Perception module in decoder using wavelet decomposition to refine details while integrating global structures.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, achieved highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

Conclusion: SFD-Mamba2Net provides an effective solution for accurate coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in challenging ICA images, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

### [6] [Live(r) Die: Predicting Survival in Colorectal Liver Metastasis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08935)
*Muhammad Alberb,Helen Cheung,Anne Martel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated MRI-based framework for predicting surgical outcomes in colorectal liver metastasis using segmentation and radiomics pipelines, achieving 10%+ improvement over existing biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prognostic models for colorectal liver metastasis lack predictive power, especially for multifocal cases, necessitating better automated prediction methods from medical imaging.

Method: Combines segmentation pipeline (using SAMONAI for 3D prompt propagation and foundation models) with radiomics pipeline (SurvAMINN neural network) to extract features from pre/post-contrast MRI and predict survival.

Result: Framework outperforms existing clinical and genomic biomarkers with C-index improvement exceeding 10% on 227-patient dataset.

Conclusion: Integration of automated segmentation and radiomics enables accurate, efficient, and interpretable outcome prediction for colorectal liver metastasis patients.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

*Lisa Dunlap,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Trevor Darrell,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Josef Sivic,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompCon is an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual attribute differences between text-to-image models and identifies prompt concepts that trigger these divergences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and how visual representations learned by different generative models diverge, and to systematically discover visual attributes that appear in one model's outputs but not another's.

Method: Introduced CompCon, an evolutionary search algorithm that identifies visual attributes more prevalent in one model's output than another, and uncovers prompt concepts linked to these differences. Created ID2 dataset with 60 input-dependent differences for evaluation.

Result: Successfully discovered divergent representations between popular models, such as PixArt depicting loneliness prompts with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicting African American people in media professions differently.

Conclusion: CompCon effectively identifies and analyzes visual representation differences between text-to-image models, providing insights into model-specific biases and characteristics.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

### [8] [An U-Net-Based Deep Neural Network for Cloud Shadow and Sun-Glint Correction of Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08949)
*Yibin Wang,Wondimagegn Beshah,Padmanava Dash,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel machine learning approach using U-Net deep learning to identify and correct cloud shadows and sun glint in UAS imagery for water quality monitoring applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAS imagery is often affected by cloud shadows and sun glint, which pose serious issues for estimating water quality parameters from aerial images, especially in cloudy conditions and over water surfaces.

Method: Used U-Net based deep learning model trained at pixel level to identify and extract regions with cloud shadows and sun glint, separating them from clear sky and unaffected regions. Best model settings were determined through various evaluation metrics.

Result: Developed a high-quality image correction model capable of recovering cloud shadow and sun glint areas in UAS images.

Conclusion: The proposed machine learning approach successfully addresses the limitations of UAS imagery by effectively identifying and correcting cloud shadows and sun glint, enabling more accurate water quality parameter estimation.

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

### [9] [CoSwin: Convolution Enhanced Hierarchical Shifted Window Attention For Small-Scale Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08959)
*Puskal Khadka,Rodrigue Rizk,Longwei Wang,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSwin is a novel Vision Transformer architecture that combines hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature learning to address ViTs' limitations in local feature extraction on small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers lack key inductive biases like locality and translation equivariance, which hurts their performance on small datasets where local feature extraction is crucial.

Method: CoSwin integrates learnable local feature enhancement modules into each attention block, enabling simultaneous capture of fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure through local-global feature fusion.

Result: CoSwin achieves consistent performance gains: 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over baseline Swin Transformer.

Conclusion: The local-global feature fusion approach effectively enhances transformer generalization and robustness for small-scale vision tasks, demonstrating the importance of combining convolutional inductive biases with self-attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

### [10] [iMatcher: Improve matching in point cloud registration via local-to-global geometric consistency learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08982)
*Karim Slimani,Catherine Achard,Brahim Tamadazte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iMatcher is a differentiable framework for point cloud feature matching that uses learned features to predict geometrically consistent confidence matrices, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve point cloud registration by developing a fully differentiable framework that incorporates both local and global geometric consistency for more accurate feature matching.

Method: Uses local graph embedding for initial score matrix, bilateral source-to-target matching via nearest neighbor search, and global geometric consistency learning to refine matching probabilities.

Result: Achieves 95%-97% inlier ratio on KITTI, 94%-97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: iMatcher significantly improves rigid registration performance and shows robustness across various real-world indoor and outdoor scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

### [11] [UltrON: Ultrasound Occupancy Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08991)
*Magdalena Wysocki,Felix Duelmer,Ananya Bal,Nassir Navab,Mohammad Farid Azampour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltrON is a novel occupancy-based representation method that leverages acoustic features from B-mode ultrasound images for 3D shape reconstruction, addressing occlusion and annotation dependency issues without additional annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ultrasound shape reconstruction methods rely on precise annotations and struggle with view-dependent artifacts and acoustic shadowing. There's a need for methods that can utilize the rich acoustic information in B-mode images without extensive manual labeling.

Method: Proposes UltrON - an occupancy-based representation that uses acoustic features from B-mode images. Introduces a novel loss function to compensate for view-dependency and enables occupancy optimization from multiview ultrasound. Works in weakly-supervised optimization regime.

Result: UltrON improves geometric consistency, mitigates limitations of occlusions and sparse labeling, and generalizes to shapes of the same anatomy by incorporating acoustic properties.

Conclusion: The method provides more accurate 3D reconstruction from ultrasound by leveraging acoustic features without additional annotation costs, addressing key challenges in ultrasound-based shape reconstruction.

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

Method: Uses implicit neural representations (INRs) conditioned on learned latent codes to predict continuous left ventricular displacement without requiring inference-time optimization.

Result: Achieved best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and lowest combined error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain on 452 UK Biobank test cases, while being ~380× faster than the most accurate baseline.

Conclusion: INR-based models are highly suitable for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in large cardiac MRI datasets.

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring

achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$
faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in

*Samuel Felipe dos Santos,Tiago Agostinho de Almeida,Jurandy Almeida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-MLNet enhances Universal Domain Adaptation by introducing dynamic weighting to focus adaptation on relevant class boundaries, outperforming previous methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UniDA methods like MLNet treat all classifiers equally, which dilutes the learning signal and reduces effectiveness in distinguishing known from unknown classes.

Method: Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet) integrates dynamic weighting strategy to Open-set Entropy Minimization, using closed-set classifier predictions to focus adaptation on the most relevant class boundaries for each target sample.

Result: E-MLNet achieves highest average H-scores on VisDA and ImageCLEF, outperforms MLNet in 22/31 Open-Partial DA tasks and 19/31 Open-Set DA tasks, demonstrating superior robustness.

Conclusion: The focused adaptation strategy through dynamic weighting significantly improves Universal Domain Adaptation performance by sharpening the distinction between known and unknown classes.

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

### [14] [COCO-Urdu: A Large-Scale Urdu Image-Caption Dataset with Multimodal Quality Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09014)
*Umair Hassan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COCO-Urdu is the largest publicly available Urdu image-caption dataset with 59K images and 319K captions, created to address the under-representation of Urdu in multimodal research and reduce language bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urdu is critically under-served in multimodal research despite being spoken by 250M+ people. The absence of large-scale, high-quality Urdu datasets has limited system development and reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on high-resource languages.

Method: Created from MS COCO using stratified sampling to preserve original distribution. Captions translated using SeamlessM4T v2 and validated with hybrid multimodal quality estimation (COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP for visual grounding, BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency). Low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source LLMs.

Result: Dataset contains 59,000 images and 319,000 Urdu captions. Benchmarked on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF with consistently strong results. Largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset.

Conclusion: COCO-Urdu aims to reduce language bias in multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language systems. Both dataset and quality estimation pipeline are released to benefit the research community.

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

### [16] [Integrating Anatomical Priors into a Causal Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09054)
*Binxu Li,Wei Peng,Mingjie Li,Ehsan Adeli,Kilian M. Pohl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCGM is a novel diffusion-based framework that integrates anatomical constraints to generate high-quality counterfactual 3D brain MRIs, preserving subtle morphological variations for medical studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D brain MRI studies need to detect subtle morphometric differences between cohorts, but counterfactual models struggle to produce anatomically plausible MRIs due to lack of explicit inductive biases to preserve fine-grained anatomical details.

Method: Proposes Probabilistic Causal Graph Model (PCGM) that integrates anatomical constraints via probabilistic graph module, generates spatial binary masks of regions with subtle variations, and uses a 3D ControlNet-encoded mask to constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet with 3D diffusion decoder.

Result: PCGM generates structural brain MRIs of higher quality than baseline approaches. Brain measurements from PCGM-generated counterfactuals replicate subtle disease effects on cortical regions previously reported in neuroscience literature.

Conclusion: PCGM represents an important milestone for using synthetic MRIs in studies investigating subtle morphological differences, successfully preserving medically relevant local variations that traditional methods overlook.

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes multi-task learning with fixed object information to improve human-object interaction recognition, achieving 99.25% accuracy on a custom dataset of fixed object interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GCNs fail to detect human-object interactions effectively due to lack of scene information representation and appropriate learning architectures for fixed objects in environments.

Method: Multi-task learning approach that incorporates fixed object information and interaction area data alongside human skeleton poses to recognize human-object interactions.

Result: Achieved 99.25% accuracy on custom dataset containing fixed object interactions (ATM machines, check-in/out machines) and non-interaction actions, outperforming base skeleton-only model by 2.75%.

Conclusion: Incorporating fixed object information through multi-task learning significantly improves human-object interaction recognition performance compared to using only human skeleton data.

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

TL;DR: Proposes IRDFusion framework with MFRM and DFFM modules for multispectral object detection, using iterative feedback to enhance salient features while suppressing background noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multispectral object detection methods retain extraneous background/noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance. Need for better cross-modal feature fusion that suppresses interference while enhancing complementary information.

Method: Two novel modules: Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) enhances intra- and inter-modal feature relationships, and Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM) computes inter-modal differential features as guidance signals. Integrated into IRDFusion framework with iterative feedback mechanism.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on FLIR, LLVIP and M³FD datasets. Consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying salient relational signals through iterative feedback while suppressing feature noise, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness for multispectral object detection.

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQAP-VLA is a training-free framework that simultaneously enables quantization and token pruning for Vision-Language-Action models, achieving 1.93x speedup while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models have high computational and memory costs that hinder practical deployment, and existing compression methods fail to combine quantization and token pruning effectively due to incompatibility issues.

Method: Co-design quantization and token pruning pipeline with new quantization-aware token pruning criteria and enhanced quantizer design that works on aggressively quantized models.

Result: Achieves 1.93x speedup and up to 4.5% average success rate enhancement compared to original VLA models while preserving core performance.

Conclusion: SQAP-VLA successfully overcomes the incompatibility between quantization and token pruning, enabling holistic efficiency improvement for VLA models without training.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the
original model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S-BEVLoc is a self-supervised LiDAR global localization framework that eliminates the need for ground-truth poses by using BEV images and geographic distances between patches, achieving state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and NCLT datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR localization methods require expensive ground-truth poses from GPS or SLAM odometry for supervision, which involves substantial cost and effort for high-precision acquisition.

Method: Uses BEV images to construct training triplets based on geographic distances between keypoint-centered patches. Employs CNN for local feature extraction and NetVLAD for global descriptor aggregation, with SoftCos loss for triplet learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and NCLT datasets for place recognition, loop closure, and global localization tasks.

Conclusion: S-BEVLoc provides a scalable self-supervised alternative to supervised approaches, eliminating the need for ground-truth poses while maintaining high performance in LiDAR-based global localization.

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile device usage detection requires understanding behavioral context and relationships between faces, hands, and devices, which existing benchmarks don't adequately capture.

Method: Created FPI-Det dataset with synchronized face and phone annotations across workplace, education, transportation, and public scenarios, then evaluated YOLO and DETR detectors.

Result: Provided baseline performance results and analysis across object sizes, occlusion levels, and different environments.

Conclusion: FPI-Det addresses the gap in fine-grained human-device interaction benchmarks and enables better phone usage detection in safety monitoring and productivity assessment applications.

Abstract: The widespread use of mobile devices has created new challenges for vision
systems in safety monitoring, workplace productivity assessment, and attention
management. Detecting whether a person is using a phone requires not only
object recognition but also an understanding of behavioral context, which
involves reasoning about the relationship between faces, hands, and devices
under diverse conditions. Existing generic benchmarks do not fully capture such
fine-grained human--device interactions. To address this gap, we introduce the
FPI-Det, containing 22{,}879 images with synchronized annotations for faces and
phones across workplace, education, transportation, and public scenarios. The
dataset features extreme scale variation, frequent occlusions, and varied
capture conditions. We evaluate representative YOLO and DETR detectors,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZeroPlantSeg enables zero-shot hierarchical segmentation of rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images by combining foundation segmentation models for leaf extraction with vision-language models for structural reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation segmentation models can extract leaf instances but struggle with hierarchical segmentation of entire plant individuals with overlapping leaves, which typically requires annotated training datasets that are species-specific and labor-intensive to create.

Method: Integrates a foundation segmentation model to extract leaf instances and a vision-language model to reason about plant structures, enabling extraction of complete plant individuals without additional training or annotated datasets.

Result: The method outperforms existing zero-shot approaches and achieves better cross-domain performance than supervised methods across multiple plant species, growth stages, and shooting environments.

Conclusion: ZeroPlantSeg provides an effective zero-shot solution for hierarchical plant segmentation that eliminates the need for species-specific training data while maintaining strong performance across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

TL;DR: This paper improves CLIP for person representation learning by creating WebPerson dataset (5M high-quality person-centric image-text pairs) and proposing GA-DMS framework with adaptive masking and prediction objectives, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP faces challenges in person representation learning due to scarce annotated person-centric vision-language data and limitations of global contrastive learning that struggles with fine-grained matching and noisy text tokens.

Method: Developed noise-resistant data pipeline using MLLMs to filter and caption web images, creating WebPerson dataset. Introduced GA-DMS framework with gradient-attention guided dual-masking to adaptively mask noisy text tokens and added masked token prediction objectives.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The synergistic approach of improved data curation (WebPerson) and model architecture (GA-DMS) successfully advances CLIP for person representation learning, addressing data scarcity and fine-grained feature preservation challenges.

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building large-scale PET foundation models is challenging due to limited labeled data and computational resources. The authors aim to overcome data scarcity and efficiency limitations for PET imaging applications.

Method: Proposes ALL-PET with three key innovations: 1) Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) generating 200k+ diverse training samples, 2) positive/negative mask constraints for geometric consistency, and 3) transparent medical attention (TMA) for lesion-focused guidance in projection space.

Result: ALL-PET achieves high-quality sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to models trained on larger datasets. It generalizes across multiple tasks including low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and tracer separation, while using under 24GB memory.

Conclusion: The proposed ALL-PET framework successfully addresses data scarcity and computational limitations in PET imaging through innovative projection-domain processing, enabling efficient and effective foundation model development with minimal resources while maintaining clinical flexibility and interpretability.

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compare noise robustness between traditional Persistent Homology approaches and Artificial Neural Networks for topological structure inference from data.

Method: Trained supervised neural network to predict Betti numbers and compared against PH pipeline using cubical complexes and Signed Euclidean Distance Transform on one synthetic and two real-world datasets.

Result: ANNs demonstrated superior performance over PH approach under noise conditions.

Conclusion: ANNs offer a compelling alternative to PH for topology estimation in the presence of structural noise, leveraging their capacity to learn from training data.

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

TL;DR: OSIM is a new evaluation metric for 3D scenes that focuses on object-level perception rather than overall image quality, better aligning with human visual perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics assess overall image quality but don't align well with human perception, which fundamentally involves attention to individual objects as basic units of visual recognition.

Method: Leverages object detection models and their feature representations to quantify the 'objectness' of each object in 3D scenes, enabling object-centric evaluations.

Result: User studies show OSIM aligns more closely with human perception compared to existing metrics. The paper also re-evaluates recent 3D reconstruction and generation models using standardized experimental setup.

Conclusion: OSIM provides a more human-aligned evaluation approach for 3D scenes by focusing on object-level perception, and helps clarify advancements in 3D reconstruction and generation field.

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric
for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The OCELOT 2023 challenge demonstrated that incorporating multi-scale cell-tissue interactions significantly improves cell detection performance over traditional cell-only models, with top entries achieving up to 7.99 F1-score improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathologists examine Whole-Slide Images at multiple magnifications to evaluate both tissue morphology and cellular details, but existing deep learning models struggle to learn these interdependent multi-scale semantics. The challenge aimed to validate that understanding cell-tissue interactions is crucial for human-level performance.

Method: The OCELOT 2023 challenge created a dataset with multi-scale overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from 673 pairs across six organs from 306 TCGA Whole-Slide Images. Participants developed models that incorporated cell-tissue relationships.

Result: Top-performing models achieved up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to baseline cell-only models that didn't incorporate cell-tissue relationships, showing substantial performance improvement over traditional methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating multi-scale semantics and cell-tissue interactions is essential for achieving human-level performance in cell detection, as demonstrated by the significant improvements in the OCELOT 2023 challenge.

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RT-DETR++ enhances UAV object detection with improved encoder design using channel-gated attention upsampling/downsampling and CSP-PAC feature fusion, achieving better small object detection while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in UAV imagery object detection including densely packed small objects, scale variations, and occlusion issues that are common in aerial imagery.

Method: Enhances RT-DETR encoder with: 1) Channel-gated attention-based upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism for error minimization and detail preservation, 2) CSP-PAC technique using parallel hollow convolutions for local and contextual information processing in feature fusion.

Result: Superior performance in detecting small and densely packed objects, maintains sufficient speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity.

Conclusion: Provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time detection systems, particularly beneficial for UAV imagery analysis.

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This
study provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time
detection systems.

### [31] [A Knowledge Noise Mitigation Framework for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09159)
*Zhiyue Liu,Sihang Liu,Jinyuan Liu,Xinru Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework for knowledge-based VQA that reduces noise by focusing on relevant knowledge through better retrieval, knowledge extraction, and selective integration only when needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KB-VQA approaches introduce noise by directly using retrieved knowledge without addressing redundancy, which harms answer accuracy.

Method: Proposes a framework with: 1) Low-noise queries for better knowledge retrieval, 2) LLM prompting to extract answer-beneficial knowledge segments, 3) Selective integration only when model lacks confidence.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by acquiring more accurate and critical knowledge.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free knowledge focusing framework effectively mitigates noise from redundant knowledge and improves KB-VQA performance.

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Yulin Tong,Fengzong Zhang,Haiqin Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CWSSNet framework combines 3D spectral-spatial features with wavelet convolution for hyperspectral image classification, achieving high accuracy with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images have rich spectral information but suffer from feature redundancy due to high dimensionality and spectral mixing, requiring advanced classification methods.

Method: Proposed CWSSNet framework using ZY1F satellite hyperspectral data, integrating 3D spectral-spatial features with wavelet convolution and multiscale convolutional attention module for multimodal information fusion.

Result: Achieved 74.50% mIoU, 82.73% mAcc, and 84.94% mF1 scores, with highest IoU for water bodies, vegetation, and bare land classification. Maintained reliable performance with 70% training set and limited training time increase.

Conclusion: CWSSNet effectively addresses hyperspectral image classification challenges, demonstrates good robustness, and performs well under small-sample training conditions with efficient computational requirements.

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

TL;DR: RRDataset is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated image detection methods across real-world scenarios, internet transmission effects, and re-digitization challenges, revealing significant limitations in current detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the research gap in evaluating AI-generated image detection methods under complex real-world conditions, as current datasets lack comprehensive coverage of diverse scenarios and real-world distortions.

Method: Created RRDataset with images from 7 major scenarios, tested 17 detectors and 10 VLMs, conducted large-scale human study with 192 participants to examine human few-shot learning capabilities.

Result: Benchmarking revealed significant limitations of current AI detection methods in real-world conditions. Human participants showed adaptability through few-shot learning, outperforming many automated methods.

Conclusion: Current AI detection methods are inadequate for real-world applications. Future robust detection algorithms should incorporate human-like adaptability and learning capabilities to handle complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image
synthesis has posed new challenges to digital security and media credibility.
Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these
concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance
under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World
Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models
across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses
high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and
Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and
Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset
gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to
investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated
images. The benchmarking results reveal the limitations of current AI detection
methods under real-world conditions and underscore the importance of drawing on
human adaptability to develop more robust detection algorithms.

TL;DR: Dark-ISP is a lightweight self-adaptive ISP plugin that processes Bayer RAW images directly for low-light object detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light object detection is challenging due to degraded image quality. Existing approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex frameworks, creating a need for a more efficient solution.

Method: Deconstructs conventional ISP pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone mapping) sub-modules as differentiable components. Uses content-aware adaptability and physics-informed priors with a Self-Boost mechanism for sub-module cooperation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches on three RAW image datasets, achieving superior results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

Conclusion: Dark-ISP enables seamless end-to-end training for object detection by directly processing Bayer RAW images, providing an effective solution for low-light object detection with lightweight architecture.

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

### [36] [MGTraj: Multi-Granularity Goal-Guided Human Trajectory Prediction with Recursive Refinement Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09200)
*Ge Sun,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGTraj is a multi-granularity goal-guided model for human trajectory prediction that recursively refines trajectory proposals from coarse to fine granularity levels using transformer-based refinement networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most goal-guided approaches operate at extreme granularities (coarse goal prediction and fine trajectory completion), leaving intermediate temporal granularity unexplored despite its potential utility in capturing diverse human dynamics.

Method: Proposes MGTraj with recursive encoding from coarse to fine granularity levels, transformer-based recursive refinement networks (RRN) at each level, weight-sharing strategy for feature integration across granularities, and velocity prediction as auxiliary task.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on ETH/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset show MGTraj outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

Conclusion: Multi-granularity modeling effectively integrates goal guidance with diverse temporal scales, demonstrating superior performance in human trajectory prediction tasks.

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

*Jiesi Hu,Jianfeng Cao,Yanwu Yang,Chenfei Ye,Yixuan Zhang,Hanyang Peng,Ting Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medverse is a universal in-context learning model for 3D medical imaging that achieves high-fidelity predictions with global anatomical understanding across diverse medical imaging tasks and anatomical regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ICL models for medical imaging cannot simultaneously achieve high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and lack a unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks and anatomical regions, limiting the potential of ICL in medical imaging.

Method: Medverse employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating full-resolution volumetric outputs. It uses a blockwise cross-attention module for long-range interactions between context and target inputs while maintaining computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Trained on 22 datasets covering diverse tasks across multiple organs, modalities, and clinical centers.

Result: Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL baselines and demonstrates strong performance on held-out datasets covering previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.

Conclusion: Medverse establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning in medical imaging, offering a universal solution for diverse 3D medical image analysis tasks without retraining, with code and model weights made publicly available.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available

precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all
CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization

first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization

TL;DR: MMOral is the first large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark for panoramic X-ray interpretation in dentistry, consisting of 20,563 annotated images with 1.3M instruction instances. Current LVLMs perform poorly (best model GPT-4o at 41.45% accuracy), but OralGPT (fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-7B) shows 24.73% improvement after SFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models show strong performance on general medical tasks but remain underexplored in specialized domains like dentistry. Panoramic X-rays present unique challenges with dense anatomical structures and subtle pathological cues not captured by existing medical benchmarks.

Method: Created MMOral dataset with 20,563 annotated panoramic X-rays and 1.3M instruction instances across attribute extraction, report generation, VQA, and image-grounded dialogue. Developed MMOral-Bench evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions. Proposed OralGPT by conducting supervised fine-tuning on Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the MMOral dataset.

Result: Evaluation of 64 LVLMs revealed poor performance, with GPT-4o achieving only 41.45% accuracy. OralGPT demonstrated substantial improvement with 24.73% performance enhancement after just one epoch of supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: MMOral and OralGPT provide a critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically impactful multimodal AI systems in dental applications. The significant performance gap and improvement potential highlight the need for domain-specific training in specialized medical fields.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance gap between open-source and closed-source text-to-image models due to lack of large-scale reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive evaluation benchmarks.

Method: Created FLUX-Reason-6M dataset with 6M high-quality images organized by 6 characteristics (Imagination, Entity, Text rendering, Style, Affection, Composition) using Generation Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) for detailed generation steps. Developed PRISM-Bench with 7 evaluation tracks using advanced vision-language models for human-aligned assessment.

Result: The dataset curation took 15,000 A100 GPU days. Evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench revealed critical performance gaps and specific areas needing improvement.

Conclusion: The released dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code aim to catalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented text-to-image generation by providing previously unattainable resources to the research community.

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered
by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive
evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading
closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M
and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).
FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality
FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)
descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial
labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct
tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through
carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for
nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image
aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench
reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring
improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to
catalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation. Project page:

*Chao Yuan,Yang Yang,Yehui Yang,Zach Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DATE method enhances temporal awareness in MLLMs through timestamp injection and semantic-guided sampling, achieving SOTA performance on long video understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with long-range temporal dependencies and precise event localization in long videos due to uniform frame sampling and implicit position encodings.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) with Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy that treats video sampling as vision-language retrieval with two-stage algorithm.

Result: Achieves remarkable improvements in absolute time understanding and event localization, with 7B model outperforming many 72B models on hour-long video benchmarks.

Conclusion: DATE provides an effective solution for long video understanding by enhancing temporal awareness through explicit timestamp modeling and semantic-guided sampling strategies.

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSP-Seg is a progressive pruning framework for efficient 3D medical image segmentation that dynamically prunes redundant modules, achieving nnU-Net-level performance with 42-45% less GPU memory, 29-48% faster training, and 83-87% fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D medical image segmentation faces heavy resource and time consumption, limiting clinical scalability. Existing efficient models are static and manually designed, lacking adaptability and balanced performance-efficiency tradeoffs.

Method: PSP-Seg starts with a redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules using block-wise pruning and functional decoupling loss to enable dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation.

Result: PSP-Seg-S achieves performance comparable to nnU-Net while reducing GPU memory by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameters by 83-87% across five public datasets.

Conclusion: PSP-Seg offers a cost-effective, high-performing alternative for widespread clinical 3D segmentation applications by dynamically optimizing model efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

### [44] [Visual Programmability: A Guide for Code-as-Thought in Chart Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09286)
*Bohao Tang,Yan Ma,Fei Zhang,Jiadi Su,Ethan Chern,Zhulin Hu,Zhixin Wang,Pengfei Liu,Ya Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach with adaptive Visual Programmability that learns when to use code-based reasoning vs direct visual analysis for chart understanding, using RL with dual-reward system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of prior chart understanding approaches: external tools make systems brittle, while specialist models use single reasoning strategies with unverifiable intermediate steps that complicate RL training.

Method: Adaptive framework where VLM learns to choose between CaT pathway (code-based symbolic representation) and direct visual reasoning. Uses reinforcement learning with dual-reward system combining data-accuracy reward and decision reward.

Result: Demonstrates strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding benchmarks. Shows VLMs can learn not only to reason but also how to reason by dynamically selecting optimal pathways.

Conclusion: VLMs can be taught to adaptively choose reasoning strategies through visual programmability, combining code-based and visual reasoning with verifiable intermediate steps for improved chart understanding.

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

*Anthony P. Addison,Felix Wagner,Wentian Xu,Natalie Voets,Konstantinos Kamnitsas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A U-net modification with modality-agnostic input channels and synthetic MRI augmentation enables brain lesion segmentation on both seen and unseen MRI modalities, improving flexibility without losing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities and cannot effectively process new ones at inference, while some generalized models lose modality-specific discriminative information.

Method: Modified U-net architecture with modality-agnostic input channel alongside modality-specific channels, trained using image augmentation that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities by differentially altering appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue while maintaining anatomical integrity.

Result: Evaluated on 8 MRI databases with 5 pathology types and 8 modalities, the approach preserves ability to process training modalities while effectively handling new unseen modalities to improve segmentation.

Conclusion: A simple architectural modification with synthetic data augmentation enables practical multimodal brain MRI segmentation that works flexibly with any available imaging modalities, including combinations of seen and unseen ones.

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel open-set detection framework for UAV air-to-air object detection that handles unknown objects and corrupted flight data through embedding-space entropy modeling, achieving 10% AUROC improvement over YOLO-based detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional closed-set detectors degrade significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing safety risks for UAV autonomy in real-world air-to-air detection scenarios.

Method: Model-agnostic framework using embedding-based detectors with semantic uncertainty estimation via entropy modeling, spectral normalization, and temperature scaling for enhanced open-set discrimination.

Result: Achieves up to 10% relative AUROC gain compared to standard YOLO-based detectors on AOT aerial benchmark, with background rejection improving robustness without compromising detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed solution is well-suited for reliable UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments, demonstrating consistent improvements over baseline methods through extensive real-world flight tests.

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

*Oh-Tae Jang,Min-Gon Cho,Kyung-Tae Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlotSAR is a novel object-centric learning framework that disentangles target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask annotations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR images contain complex background clutter that resembles targets, causing models to extract entangled or spurious features and undermining clear target representation formation.

Method: Extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X and low-level scattering features from wavelet scattering network, then uses multi-level slot attention to integrate these complementary features for robust target characterization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Conclusion: SlotSAR effectively disentangles target representations from background clutter without mask annotations, demonstrating superior performance through complementary multi-level feature integration.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHCP enables heterogeneous collaborative perception without joint training by using few-shot unsupervised domain adaptation during inference


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require impractical joint training or pre-storing all collaborator models, making real-world deployment challenging

Method: Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP) dynamically aligns features by self-training an adapter during inference using few-shot unlabeled data

Result: PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios on OPV2V dataset, comparable to SOTA methods trained on entire dataset

Conclusion: PHCP successfully eliminates the need for joint training while maintaining competitive performance through inference-time adaptation

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses
external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and

Motivation: Vision-language models' purely visual inference capabilities remain under-explored despite strong zero-shot classification through image-text alignment.

Method: Evaluated dual-encoder VLMs (including SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5) on ImageNet-1k, analyzed factors affecting accuracy, and introduced learning-free fusion method based on per-class precision.

Result: Language and vision offer complementary strengths - some classes favor textual prompts while others are better handled by visual similarity.

Conclusion: The proposed simple fusion method exploiting complementarity between language and vision improves classification performance without requiring learning.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

Motivation: Address the scarcity of high-quality annotated MRI data in Sub-Saharan Africa for glioma segmentation, which hinders deployment of advanced AI models in clinical workflows in low-resource settings.

Method: 3D Attention UNet architecture augmented with residual blocks, enhanced through transfer learning from pre-trained weights on BraTS 2021 dataset, evaluated on 95 MRI cases from BraTS-Africa dataset.

Result: Achieved Dice scores of 0.76 (Enhancing Tumor), 0.80 (Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core), and 0.85 (Surrounding Non-Functional Hemisphere) despite limited data quality and quantity.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates strong generalizability and practicality for clinical deployment in low-resource settings, with compact size (~90MB) and sub-minute inference time, contributing to equitable AI for global health.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and
accessible medical imaging solutions.

Abstract: Generative AI evolves the execution of complex workflows in industry, where
the large multimodal model empowers fashion design in the garment industry.
Current generation AI models magically transform brainstorming into fancy

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes intensify misinformation spread in political contexts, and existing detection datasets are limited by outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, making them ineffective for general synthetic image detection.

Method: Created a dataset with 3M real images paired with captions, used to generate 963k high-quality synthetic images from proprietary and open-source models. Introduced a crowdsourced adversarial platform where participants generate challenging synthetic images to test detection methods.

Result: The dataset provides comprehensive benchmarking for modern deepfake detection. Human perception studies show recent proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable from real ones, complicating public identification.

Conclusion: The ongoing community-driven initiative ensures deepfake detection methods remain robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from sophisticated misinformation threats as generative techniques continue to evolve.

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from
sophisticated misinformation threats.

*Dimitrios Anastasiou,Razvan Caramalau,Nazir Sirajudeen,Matthew Boal,Philip Edwards,Justin Collins,John Kelly,Ashwin Sridhar,Maxine Tran,Faiz Mumtaz,Nevil Pavithran,Nader Francis,Danail Stoyanov,Evangelos B. Mazomenos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates self-supervised pre-training strategies for few-shot surgical skill assessment, finding that domain-relevant datasets outperform larger but less aligned sources, with procedure-specific data integration boosting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical skill assessment requires expert annotations that are scarce and time-consuming. Few-shot learning offers a scalable alternative but depends heavily on effective pre-training, which has been largely unexplored in surgical skill assessment.

Method: The authors formulate surgical skill assessment as a few-shot task, annotate a robotic surgery dataset with OSATS scores, and evaluate various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings (1-, 2-, and 5-shot). They quantify domain similarity and analyze how domain gap and procedure-specific data inclusion affect transferability.

Result: Domain-relevant small datasets outperformed large-scale but less aligned sources, achieving accuracies of 60.16% (1-shot), 66.03% (2-shot), and 73.65% (5-shot). Incorporating procedure-specific data with domain-relevant external datasets boosted performance by +1.22% accuracy and +2.28% F1-score on average.

Conclusion: The quality and domain relevance of pre-training data is more important than quantity for few-shot surgical skill assessment. Procedure-specific data integration with domain-relevant sources enhances performance, while using less similar large-scale sources can degrade results.

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and

TL;DR: Align4Gen improves video diffusion models by aligning intermediate features with pre-trained vision encoders, using multi-feature fusion and alignment during training to enhance video generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models have advanced through architectural innovations but lack attention to feature representation power. The authors aim to improve video generation by leveraging pre-trained vision encoders for feature alignment.

Method: Proposed Align4Gen - a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method that integrates feature alignment with pre-trained vision encoders into video diffusion model training. Includes analysis of various vision encoders for discriminability and temporal consistency.

Result: Align4Gen shows improved video generation performance for both unconditional and class-conditional tasks, as quantified by various evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Feature alignment with pre-trained vision encoders is beneficial for video diffusion models, and the proposed Align4Gen method effectively enhances video generation quality through multi-feature fusion and alignment.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional
and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in
improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results

*Xiaodong Wang,Zijun He,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for intrinsic image decomposition that handles complex scenes with severe lighting and rich textures using texture-guided regularization to separate reflectance and shading layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous learning-based methods produce texture-less and over-smoothing intrinsic images, failing to handle complex scenes with spatially-varying lighting and rich textures.

Method: Design a texture-guided regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an optimization framework to separate material textures from lighting effects.

Result: The proposed texture-aware prior produces superior results compared to existing approaches for real-world images with complex lighting and textures.

Conclusion: Combining texture-aware priors in an optimization framework enables high-quality intrinsic image decomposition for challenging real-world scenes with complex lighting and rich textures.

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

*Akshit Achara,Esther Puyol Anton,Alexander Hammers,Andrew P. King*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates shortcut learning and demographic bias in deep learning-based Alzheimer's disease diagnosis from MRI scans, demonstrating that models can learn spurious features related to race and sex that lead to performance bias against underrepresented groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning algorithms for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis from MRI can suffer from shortcut learning where they use spurious features related to protected attributes like race and sex, potentially leading to biased performance against underrepresented demographic groups.

Method: The researchers used multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet and SwinTransformer) to: 1) test if models can identify race/sex from brain MRI scans, 2) examine if training set imbalance causes performance drops indicating bias, and 3) conduct quantitative/qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different brain regions for both protected attribute and AD classification tasks.

Result: The study demonstrated the existence of both race and sex-based shortcut learning and bias in DL-based AD classification, showing that models can identify demographic attributes from MRI scans and that training imbalances lead to performance bias.

Conclusion: This work establishes the foundation for developing fairer deep learning diagnostic tools in brain MRI by identifying and characterizing demographic bias issues, with code provided for reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores connections between Plug-and-Play methods and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models for solving inverse problems in single-pixel imaging, proposing a unified framework with hybrid data-consistency that improves reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between PnP methods and DDIM for ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in single-pixel imaging, by understanding their differences in denoising mechanisms and sampling procedures.

Method: Decouples diffusion process into three interpretable stages (denoising, data consistency enforcement, sampling), proposes hybrid data-consistency module combining multiple PnP-style fidelity terms applied directly to denoised estimates.

Result: Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks demonstrate better reconstruction quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework successfully integrates learned priors with physical forward models, and the hybrid correction approach improves measurement consistency without disrupting diffusion sampling trajectories.

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

### [59] [A Fully Automatic Framework for Intracranial Pressure Grading: Integrating Keyframe Identification, ONSD Measurement and Clinical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09368)
*Pengxu Wen,Tingting Yu,Ziwei Nie,Cheng Jiang,Zhenyu Yin,Mingyang He,Bo Liao,Xiaoping Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fully automatic two-stage framework for non-invasive intracranial pressure grading using optic nerve sheath diameter measurement from ultrasound videos and clinical data fusion, achieving significantly better accuracy than conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intracranial pressure monitoring is crucial but current invasive methods like lumbar puncture carry risks. Non-invasive ONSD measurement shows promise but suffers from manual operation inconsistencies, subjectivity in view selection, and thresholding variability.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Fundus ultrasound video processing with frame-level anatomical segmentation, rule-based keyframe identification, and precise ONSD measurement; 2) ICP grading stage that fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to predict ICP grades.

Result: Achieved validation accuracy of 0.845 ± 0.071 (five-fold cross-validation) and independent test accuracy of 0.786, significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method (0.637 ± 0.111 validation, 0.429 test accuracy).

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces operator variability and integrates multi-source information, establishing a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP evaluation that can improve patient management in acute neurological conditions.

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

*Daria Laslo,Efthymios Georgiou,Marius George Linguraru,Andreas Rauschecker,Sabine Muller,Catherine R. Jutzeler,Sarah Bruningk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid framework combining mathematical tumor growth model with guided diffusion model to predict brain tumor progression and generate future MRI scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is crucial for clinical decision-making in neuro-oncology, especially in data-limited scenarios.

Method: Combines mechanistic ODE-based tumor growth model with gradient-guided DDIM (denoising diffusion implicit model). The mechanistic model captures tumor dynamics including radiotherapy effects, while DDIM synthesizes anatomically feasible future MRIs conditioned on predicted growth.

Result: Trained on BraTS adult/pediatric glioma datasets, evaluated on 60 pediatric DMG cases. Generates realistic follow-up scans with good spatial similarity metrics. Produces tumor growth probability maps showing clinically relevant extent and directionality (95th percentile Hausdorff Distance).

Conclusion: Framework enables biologically informed image generation that accounts for mechanistic priors, offering generative-space-time predictions for brain tumor progression.

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

### [61] [Unsupervised Integrated-Circuit Defect Segmentation via Image-Intrinsic Normality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09375)
*Botong Zhao,Qijun Shi,Shujing Lyu,Yue Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that extracts normal features from test images without external references, using reconstruction residuals to identify defects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IC defect segmentation relies on external normal references which is brittle due to layout variations and alignment difficulties across different IC products.

Method: Proposes a framework with a learnable normal-information extractor that aggregates normal features from test images, coherence loss to associate features with normal regions, decoder to reconstruct normal content, and pseudo-anomaly augmentation for training stability.

Result: Experiments on three IC process stage datasets show consistent improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product variability.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised framework effectively segments IC defects by leveraging internal normal patterns within test images, eliminating the need for external normal references and handling product variability robustly.

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

TL;DR: DRiFt is a feature decoupling framework that separates clinically relevant signals from task-agnostic noise in medical VLMs, improving robustness to distribution shifts through parameter-efficient tuning and cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical vision-language models often learn task-agnostic correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports, limiting their generalizability and increasing failure risks in real-world clinical deployment.

Method: Uses structured feature decoupling with LoRA (parameter-efficient tuning) and learnable prompt tokens to separate clinically relevant signals from noise. Curates high-quality image-text pairs by generating captions for diverse medical data to enhance cross-modal alignment.

Result: Improves in-distribution performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets.

Conclusion: Disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior under domain shift, contributing to safer, more trustworthy VLMs for clinical use.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

*Yuchan Jie,Yushen Xu,Xiaosong Li,Fuqiang Zhou,Jianming Lv,Huafeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FS-Diff is a novel method that jointly performs image fusion and super-resolution using semantic guidance and clarity-aware mechanisms through a conditional diffusion model approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image fusion techniques struggle with corrupted target/background structures, low resolution, and weak semantic information in real-world applications like military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions.

Method: Unifies image fusion and super-resolution as conditional generation using a diffusion model. Uses clarity sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception, bidirectional feature Mamba for global feature extraction, and modified U-Net for iterative denoising with source images and semantics as conditions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods at multiple magnifications on six public datasets and their new AVMS benchmark, recovering richer details and semantics in fused images.

Conclusion: FS-Diff effectively addresses the limitations of current fusion techniques by leveraging semantic guidance and diffusion modeling to produce high-quality fused results with enhanced details and semantic information.

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

*Peisong Wen,Qianqian Xu,Siran Dai,Runmin Cong,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses over-dispersion in dense self-supervised learning by proposing explicit semantic concentration through patch correspondence distillation with noise-tolerant ranking loss and object-aware filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream image-level SSL methods suffer from over-dispersion where patches from the same instance scatter, harming performance on dense tasks. The authors identify that image-level SSL avoids this through implicit semantic concentration mechanisms that are infeasible for dense SSL due to spatial sensitivity and complex scene data.

Method: 1) Distill patch correspondences to break strict spatial alignment using a noise-tolerant ranking loss based on extended Average Precision loss; 2) Object-aware filter that maps output space to object-based space using learnable prototypes via cross-attention.

Result: Empirical studies across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing over-dispersion and improving dense representation learning.

Conclusion: The proposed explicit semantic concentration approach with patch correspondence distillation and object-aware filtering effectively solves the over-dispersion problem in dense SSL, enabling better patch-level representation learning for dense vision tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexiD-Fuse is a diffusion-based medical image fusion network that handles flexible input quantities (2+ modalities) end-to-end using maximum likelihood estimation and EM algorithm integration, outperforming existing methods on various fusion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image fusion methods only support fixed numbers of input modalities (e.g., only 2 or 3 modalities), which limits their clinical applicability where varying numbers of medical images need to be fused.

Method: Transforms diffusion fusion into maximum likelihood estimation using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, incorporates Expectation-Maximization algorithm into diffusion sampling to handle flexible input quantities, and processes 2-3 modal inputs under same weights.

Result: Achieves best performance on Harvard datasets with 9 evaluation metrics, outperforms latest 2-3 modal fusion methods, and demonstrates effectiveness on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus fusion tasks with arbitrary input numbers.

Conclusion: FlexiD-Fuse successfully addresses the limitation of fixed-input fusion methods, providing a flexible solution that works with varying numbers of medical image modalities while maintaining high fusion quality across different clinical scenarios.

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

### [66] [Improving Human Motion Plausibility with Body Momentum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09496)
*Ha Linh Nguyen,Tze Ho Elden Tse,Angela Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local joint motion with global movement, reducing foot sliding and improving motion quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion models fail to capture the physical coupling between local joint dynamics and global root movement, leading to unrealistic motion generation with issues like foot sliding and poor balance.

Method: Introduces a new loss term that enforces consistency between generated momentum profiles and ground-truth data, using momentum as a physically grounded constraint to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.

Result: The proposed approach reduces foot sliding and jitter, improves balance, and preserves motion accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency compared to complex physics-based methods.

Conclusion: Momentum-based constraints provide an effective and physically meaningful way to couple local and global motion components, leading to more realistic and stable human motion generation.

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is fundamental for applications like automatic colorization and in-between frame generation, but remains unexplored in realistic scenarios without pre-existing segmentation or annotations.

Method: Divide line art images into patches, use Transformer-based framework to learn patch-level similarities, apply edge-aware clustering and region matching algorithm to convert patch-level predictions to region-level correspondences.

Result: Achieves 96.34% patch-level accuracy on multiple datasets and generates consistent region-level correspondences.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates strong performance for real-world manga applications and provides a practical solution for the novel task of predicting region-wise correspondence without pre-existing labels.

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

Result: Extensive experiments show GDCN achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks.

Conclusion: SGDF and GDCN effectively handle low-quality multi-view data through generative diffusion fusion, demonstrating superior clustering performance.

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualTrack is a novel dual-encoder architecture for sensorless 3D ultrasound that decouples local and global feature extraction to achieve state-of-the-art trajectory estimation from 2D image sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D ultrasound systems are costly and complex, limiting widespread adoption. Sensorless 3D US using deep learning is promising but previous approaches either ignore global features or tightly couple them with local features, restricting robust modeling of both complementary aspects.

Method: DualTrack uses separate local and global encoders: a local encoder with dense spatiotemporal convolutions for fine-grained features, and a global encoder with image backbone and temporal attention for high-level anatomical features. A lightweight fusion module combines these features for trajectory estimation.

Result: DualTrack achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a large public benchmark, with average reconstruction error below 5 mm, outperforming previous methods and producing globally consistent 3D reconstructions.

Conclusion: The decoupled dual-encoder approach effectively captures both local speckle patterns and global anatomical structures, enabling robust and accurate sensorless 3D ultrasound reconstruction at low cost.

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

TL;DR: InterAct is a large-scale 3D human-object interaction benchmark that consolidates and optimizes 21.81 hours of HOI data, expands it to 30.70 hours with reduced artifacts, and provides standardized annotations and benchmarking tasks for state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human motion capture datasets lack quality 3D human-object interaction data with proper annotations and suffer from artifacts like contact penetration, floating, and incorrect hand motions, limiting HOI research.

Method: Consolidated 21.81 hours of HOI data from diverse sources, added detailed textual annotations, developed a unified optimization framework using contact invariance principles to reduce artifacts and correct hand motions while maintaining human-object relationships.

Result: Created a 30.70-hour high-quality HOI dataset with reduced artifacts, defined six benchmarking tasks, achieved state-of-the-art performance in HOI generative modeling, and made the dataset publicly available.

Conclusion: InterAct serves as a foundational resource that advances 3D human-object interaction generation research through its large-scale, high-quality dataset and standardized benchmarking framework.

Abstract: While large-scale human motion capture datasets have advanced human motion
generation, modeling and generating dynamic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs)
remain challenging due to dataset limitations. Existing datasets often lack
extensive, high-quality motion and annotation and exhibit artifacts such as
contact penetration, floating, and incorrect hand motions. To address these
issues, we introduce InterAct, a large-scale 3D HOI benchmark featuring dataset
and methodological advancements. First, we consolidate and standardize 21.81
hours of HOI data from diverse sources, enriching it with detailed textual
annotations. Second, we propose a unified optimization framework to enhance
data quality by reducing artifacts and correcting hand motions. Leveraging the
principle of contact invariance, we maintain human-object relationships while
introducing motion variations, expanding the dataset to 30.70 hours. Third, we
define six benchmarking tasks and develop a unified HOI generative modeling
perspective, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments
validate the utility of our dataset as a foundational resource for advancing 3D
human-object interaction generation. To support continued research in this
area, the dataset is publicly available at

TL;DR: PeftCD is a parameter-efficient change detection framework using Vision Foundation Models with LoRA and Adapter modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple remote sensing datasets with minimal parameter training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in remote sensing change detection including pseudo changes, limited labeled samples, and cross-domain generalization difficulties in multi-temporal and multi-source imagery.

Method: Uses weight-sharing Siamese encoder from VFMs (SAM2 and DINOv3) with integrated LoRA and Adapter modules for efficient adaptation, plus a lightweight decoder to focus on backbone features.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on multiple datasets: SYSU-CD (73.81% IoU), WHUCD (92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%), LEVIR-CD (85.62%) with precise boundaries and pseudo-change suppression.

Conclusion: PeftCD provides optimal balance of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization, offering a scalable paradigm for adapting large VFMs to real-world remote sensing change detection applications.

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable
paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change
detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Talk2Event is the first large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event camera data, featuring 5,567 driving scenes with 13,458 annotated objects and 30,000+ validated referring expressions enriched with structured attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer microsecond precision and reliability under challenging conditions, but their integration with natural language understanding remains unexplored, creating a gap in multimodal perception for dynamic scenes.

Method: Built on real-world driving scenarios, the benchmark includes carefully validated referring expressions enriched with four structured attributes: appearance, status, relation to viewer, and relation to surrounding objects to capture spatial, temporal and relational cues.

Result: The benchmark comprises 5,567 scenes, 13,458 annotated objects, and over 30,000 validated referring expressions with attribute-centric design for interpretable and compositional grounding.

Conclusion: Talk2Event serves as a foundation for advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception with applications in robotics and human-AI interaction, enabling contextual reasoning beyond simple object recognition in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kling-Avatar is a novel cascaded framework that unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic avatar video generation, achieving superior performance in generating vivid, fluent, long-duration videos with enhanced semantic coherence and expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-driven avatar generation methods treat instruction conditioning as low-level tracking without modeling communicative purpose, compromising narrative coherence and character expressiveness.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) MLLM director produces blueprint video for high-level semantics (motion, emotions), 2) Parallel generation of sub-clips using first-last frame strategy guided by blueprint keyframes.

Result: Generates vivid, fluent 1080p videos at 48 fps with superior lip sync accuracy, emotion expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar establishes a new benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar synthesis, suitable for real-world applications like digital human livestreaming.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar
synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HumbleBench is a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs' ability to reject incorrect answers and demonstrate epistemic humility by choosing "None of the above" when no provided options are correct, addressing three types of hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks only test recognition accuracy but overlook the critical capability of models to recognize when none of the provided options are correct, which is essential for trustworthy AI in safety-critical applications.

Method: Built from panoptic scene graph dataset using fine-grained annotations to extract ground-truth entities/relations, then used GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions with "None of the above" option, followed by rigorous manual filtering.

Result: Evaluated various state-of-the-art MLLMs and shared findings about their ability to reject plausible but incorrect answers across object, relation, and attribute hallucination types.

Conclusion: HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation by incorporating explicit false-option rejection, providing a more realistic measure of MLLM reliability for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and
dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at

TL;DR: UAE framework unifies image understanding (I2T) and generation (T2I) through auto-encoder paradigm with reconstruction fidelity as training objective, using RL-based Unified-GRPO to achieve bidirectional gains between caption generation and image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified multimodal learning framework that bridges the gap between image understanding (encoding images to text) and image generation (decoding text to images) through coherent bidirectional information flow.

Method: Proposes UAE framework with: 1) Pre-training decoder with large-scale image captions, 2) Unified-GRPO RL approach with three stages: cold-start initialization, generation for understanding (encoder trained to produce captions that maximize decoder reconstruction), and understanding for generation (decoder refined to reconstruct from detailed captions).

Result: Encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions while decoder demonstrates improved ability to understand intricate descriptions, resulting in high-fidelity reconstructions. Introduces Unified-Bench benchmark for evaluating unification degree.

Conclusion: The auto-encoder paradigm with reconstruction fidelity as unified objective successfully enables mutual gains between understanding and generation, demonstrating that RL progression leads to autonomous improvement in both caption quality and reconstruction fidelity.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NRMF is a novel 3D generative human motion prior that uses neural distance fields on Riemannian manifolds to model pose, velocity, and acceleration dynamics, enabling robust and physically plausible motion recovery across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAE and diffusion-based methods lack explicit modeling of motion dynamics and physical plausibility. The authors aim to create a motion prior that respects the geometric structure of human articulations while ensuring temporal consistency and physical realism.

Method: The method constructs neural distance fields (NDFs) on the product space of joint rotations, angular velocities, and angular accelerations. It introduces an adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projection onto plausible motions and a geometric integrator for realistic motion trajectory generation.

Result: NRMF shows significant improvements across multiple tasks including denoising, motion in-betweening, and fitting to partial 2D/3D observations. It demonstrates remarkable generalization across input modalities when trained on the AMASS dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed Neural Riemannian Motion Fields provide a rigorous framework for 3D human motion generation that outperforms existing methods by explicitly modeling motion dynamics on Riemannian manifolds while ensuring physical plausibility and temporal consistency.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to
partial 2D / 3D observations.

*Artem Lukoianov,Chenyang Yuan,Justin Solomon,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper challenges the view that locality in deep diffusion models comes from convolutional neural network biases, showing instead that locality emerges from statistical properties of image datasets and pixel correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why deep diffusion models perform better than the theoretically optimal denoiser, and to investigate whether locality properties stem from dataset statistics rather than architectural biases.

Method: The authors demonstrate that an optimal parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to deep neural denoisers, and show both theoretically and experimentally that this locality arises from pixel correlations in natural images.

Result: The research presents evidence that locality emerges as a statistical property of image datasets rather than from convolutional neural network inductive biases, and crafts an analytical denoiser that better matches deep diffusion model scores.

Conclusion: The performance gap between optimal denoisers and deep diffusion models is better explained by statistical properties of image datasets than by architectural biases, leading to improved analytical models that better capture deep model behavior.

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

TL;DR: SpatialVID is a large-scale dataset of 7,089 hours of diverse real-world videos with comprehensive 3D annotations including camera poses, depth maps, and motion instructions, addressing the scarcity of high-quality training data for spatial intelligence tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial intelligence models are constrained by limited training data - existing datasets lack scale, diversity, and rich annotations, especially for real-world dynamic scenes with ground-truth camera motion.

Method: Collected over 21,000 hours of raw video, processed through hierarchical filtering into 2.7 million clips, and annotated with camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured captions, and serialized motion instructions.

Result: Created SpatialVID dataset with 7,089 hours of diverse dynamic content featuring comprehensive spatial annotations, demonstrating richness and diversity that improves model generalization.

Conclusion: SpatialVID establishes itself as a key resource for video and 3D vision research, providing the large-scale, high-quality training data needed to advance spatial intelligence capabilities.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours
of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical
filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent
annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic
information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured
captions, and serialized motion instructions. Analysis of SpatialVID's data
statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model
generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: In constrained LLM settings like the 2025 LM-KBC challenge, this paper explores triple completion through generation enhancement, quality filtering, and response parsing, finding that additional information boosts quality, LLMs can filter poor triples, and parsing tradeoffs depend on context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of RAG and fine-tuning in constrained environments like the 2025 LM-KBC challenge, where these standard techniques are restricted, by investigating alternative approaches to improve LLM output quality for triple completion tasks.

Method: The study investigates three key aspects: 1) generation techniques with additional information, 2) quality assurance through LLM-based filtering of poor quality triples, and 3) LLM response parsing strategies balancing flexibility and consistency.

Result: The research found that: additional information significantly improves generation quality, LLMs can effectively filter out poor quality triples, and the optimal approach to LLM response parsing involves a context-dependent tradeoff between flexibility and consistency.

Conclusion: In constrained LLM settings where RAG and fine-tuning are limited, strategic use of additional information, LLM-based quality filtering, and context-aware response parsing can effectively enhance triple completion performance without relying on restricted techniques.

Abstract: RAG and fine-tuning are prevalent strategies for improving the quality of LLM
outputs. However, in constrained situations, such as that of the 2025 LM-KBC
challenge, such techniques are restricted. In this work we investigate three
facets of the triple completion task: generation, quality assurance, and LLM
response parsing. Our work finds that in this constrained setting: additional
information improves generation quality, LLMs can be effective at filtering
poor quality triples, and the tradeoff between flexibility and consistency with
LLM response parsing is setting dependent.

TL;DR: AI-assisted framework using RAG to automate evidence extraction from corporate climate policy documents, showing best performance with layout-aware parsing and few-shot prompting, but requires human oversight for accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manual assessment of corporate climate policy engagement is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and error-prone, needing automation to scale monitoring efforts.

Method: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework combining layout-aware parsing, Nomic embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies to extract and classify evidence from multilingual corporate documents.

Result: The automated RAG system effectively accelerates evidence extraction from large-scale textual data, with the specific combination of techniques yielding optimal performance.

Conclusion: While AI automation accelerates evidence extraction, the nuanced analysis requires human-in-the-loop approach where technology augments rather replaces expert judgment to ensure accuracy.

Abstract: InfluenceMap's LobbyMap Platform monitors the climate policy engagement of
over 500 companies and 250 industry associations, assessing each entity's
support or opposition to science-based policy pathways for achieving the Paris
Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5{\deg}C. Although
InfluenceMap has made progress with automating key elements of the analytical
workflow, a significant portion of the assessment remains manual, making it
time- and labor-intensive and susceptible to human error. We propose an
AI-assisted framework to accelerate the monitoring of corporate climate policy
engagement by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate the most
time-intensive extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale textual data.
Our evaluation shows that a combination of layout-aware parsing, the Nomic
embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies yields the best performance
in extracting and classifying evidence from multilingual corporate documents.
We conclude that while the automated RAG system effectively accelerates
evidence extraction, the nuanced nature of the analysis necessitates a
human-in-the-loop approach where the technology augments, rather than replaces,
expert judgment to ensure accuracy.

Motivation: To enhance psychometric analysis of textual data by leveraging large language models and providing a natural psychometric interpretation framework for text-rich fields like education, psychology, and law.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Use NLP and transformer models to identify keywords and generate contextual scores, 2) Apply factor analysis (exploratory and bifactor models) to extract latent factors, determine correlations, and identify significant words per factor.

Result: Successfully applied to Wiki STEM corpus, demonstrating potential to uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns within textual data.

Conclusion: This approach enhances psychometric text analysis and shows promise for applications in text-rich domains, providing a framework for extracting meaningful psychometric insights from large text corpora.

Abstract: This research introduces a novel psychometric method for analyzing textual
data using large language models. By leveraging contextual embeddings to create
contextual scores, we transform textual data into response data suitable for
psychometric analysis. Treating documents as individuals and words as items,
this approach provides a natural psychometric interpretation under the
assumption that certain keywords, whose contextual meanings vary significantly
across documents, can effectively differentiate documents within a corpus. The
modeling process comprises two stages: obtaining contextual scores and
performing psychometric analysis. In the first stage, we utilize natural
language processing techniques and encoder based transformer models to identify
common keywords and generate contextual scores. In the second stage, we employ
various types of factor analysis, including exploratory and bifactor models, to
extract and define latent factors, determine factor correlations, and identify
the most significant words associated with each factor. Applied to the Wiki
STEM corpus, our experimental results demonstrate the method's potential to
uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns within textual data. This
approach not only enhances the psychometric analysis of textual data but also
holds promise for applications in fields rich in textual information, such as
education, psychology, and law.

### [82] [BRoverbs -- Measuring how much LLMs understand Portuguese proverbs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08960)
*Thales Sales Almeida,Giovana Kerche Bonás,João Guilherme Alves Santos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BRoverbs is a new benchmark dataset using Brazilian proverbs to evaluate Portuguese-language LLMs, addressing limitations of translated datasets and existing Portuguese evaluations that focus mainly on exams or sentiment analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show performance variations across linguistic and cultural contexts, but Portuguese evaluations are limited, often using translated datasets that miss linguistic nuances and cultural references, leaving gaps in assessing broader linguistic understanding.

Method: Created BRoverbs dataset specifically designed with Brazilian proverbs to assess LLM performance. Proverbs serve as rich linguistic resources containing cultural wisdom, figurative expressions, and complex syntactic structures that challenge model comprehension of regional expressions.

Result: A new evaluation tool for Portuguese-language LLMs that provides regionally informed benchmarking. The benchmark dataset is publicly available.

Conclusion: BRoverbs addresses the need for mature evaluation frameworks that can assess LLM capabilities in specific regional settings, particularly for Portuguese, by using culturally relevant proverbs to better evaluate linguistic and cultural understanding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant performance variations
depending on the linguistic and cultural context in which they are applied.
This disparity signals the necessity of mature evaluation frameworks that can
assess their capabilities in specific regional settings. In the case of
Portuguese, existing evaluations remain limited, often relying on translated
datasets that may not fully capture linguistic nuances or cultural references.
Meanwhile, native Portuguese-language datasets predominantly focus on
structured national exams or sentiment analysis of social media interactions,
leaving gaps in evaluating broader linguistic understanding. To address this
limitation, we introduce BRoverbs, a dataset specifically designed to assess
LLM performance through Brazilian proverbs. Proverbs serve as a rich linguistic
resource, encapsulating cultural wisdom, figurative expressions, and complex
syntactic structures that challenge the model comprehension of regional
expressions. BRoverbs aims to provide a new evaluation tool for
Portuguese-language LLMs, contributing to advancing regionally informed
benchmarking. The benchmark is available at

### [83] [Can Vision-Language Models Solve Visual Math Equations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09013)
*Monjoy Narayan Choudhury,Junling Wang,Yifan Hou,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with visual equation solving due to counting bottlenecks and multi-step reasoning challenges, despite strong performance on text-based equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why Vision-Language Models (VLMs) fail at tasks requiring integrated perception and symbolic computation, specifically visual equation solving where equations are embedded in images with object icons as variables.

Method: Decomposed visual equation solving into coefficient counting and variable recognition components, analyzed performance on both textual and visually grounded equations, and examined how equation complexity affects reasoning capabilities.

Result: VLMs perform well on textual equations but fail on visual counterparts. Counting is the primary bottleneck even with accurate recognition. Multi-step reasoning introduces additional errors, and symbolic reasoning becomes limiting as equation complexity increases.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have key weaknesses in visually grounded mathematical reasoning, particularly in counting and multi-step reasoning, pointing to areas needing future improvement for better integrated perception and symbolic computation.

Abstract: Despite strong performance in visual understanding and language-based
reasoning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with tasks requiring
integrated perception and symbolic computation. We study this limitation
through visual equation solving, where mathematical equations are embedded in
images, variables are represented by object icons, and coefficients must be
inferred by counting. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail
on visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the
task into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting
is the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. We also observe
that composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors,
highlighting challenges in multi-step visual reasoning. Finally, as equation
complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes a limiting factor.
These findings reveal key weaknesses in current VLMs and point toward future
improvements in visually grounded mathematical reasoning.

*Thomas Manuel Rost,Martina Figlia,Bernd Wallraff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPICE is a simple diagnostic signal that measures LLM willingness to re-engage with users based on interaction transcripts, showing strong discrimination between friendly, unclear, and abusive tones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a simple, low-overhead tool for auditing model dispositions and understanding how LLMs respond to different user interaction tones, complementing existing classification metrics.

Method: Tested 4 open-weight chat models using a 3-tone (friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set across 4 framing conditions (480 trials total), asking YES/NO questions about willingness to continue interactions.

Result: SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone: 97.5% YES for friendly interactions, 60.4% YES for unclear, and 17.9% YES for abusive interactions. It provides distinct signal from abuse classification and remains robust under statistical tests.

Conclusion: SPICE is a valid, robust, and reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions that offers direct relational signals about a model's state, with all materials released for replication.

Abstract: We introduce and evaluate Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued
Engagement (SPICE), a simple diagnostic signal elicited by asking a Large
Language Model a YES or NO question about its willingness to re-engage with a
user's behavior after reviewing a short transcript. In a study using a 3-tone
(friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set, we tested four
open-weight chat models across four framing conditions, resulting in 480
trials. Our findings show that SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone.
Friendly interactions yielded a near-unanimous preference to continue (97.5%
YES), while abusive interactions yielded a strong preference to discontinue
(17.9% YES), with unclear interactions falling in between (60.4% YES). This
core association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical
tests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse
classification. In trials where a model failed to identify abuse, it still
overwhelmingly stated a preference not to continue the interaction (81% of the
time). An exploratory analysis also reveals a significant interaction effect: a
preamble describing the study context significantly impacts SPICE under
ambiguity, but only when transcripts are presented as a single block of text
rather than a multi-turn chat. The results validate SPICE as a robust,
low-overhead, and reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions,
complementing existing metrics by offering a direct, relational signal of a
model's state. All stimuli, code, and analysis scripts are released to support
replication.

*Piyush Pant*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Combined SFT+DPO approach outperforms individual SFT or DPO methods for aligning OPT-350M model, achieving best results across safety and helpfulness metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of different alignment techniques (SFT, DPO, and their combination) for improving language model safety and helpfulness, addressing challenges like noisy data and resource constraints.

Method: Trained and evaluated four OPT-350M models (base, SFT-only, DPO-only, SFT+DPO) using Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset, with three evaluation metrics: Harmlessness Rate, Helpfulness Rate, and Combined Alignment Score from reward model outputs.

Result: SFT outperformed DPO individually, but the combined SFT+DPO model achieved the best performance across all metrics, demonstrating complementary benefits of both techniques.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive analysis of fine-tuning strategies for model alignment and establishes a foundation for developing more robust alignment pipelines, showing that combined approaches yield superior results.

Abstract: This research investigates the effectiveness of alignment techniques,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a
combined SFT+DPO approach on improving the safety and helpfulness of the
OPT-350M language model. Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset,
we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model,
and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation
metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined
Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show
that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all
others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these
techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited
GPU resources, and training constraints. This study offers a comprehensive view
of how fine-tuning strategies affect model alignment and provides a foundation
for more robust alignment pipelines in future work.

TL;DR: Proposes MR-UIE, a reinforcement learning approach with multi-perspective reasoning to enhance LLMs' performance in universal information extraction tasks, improving both accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in universal information extraction, especially with structured outputs requiring complex schema descriptions and multi-step reasoning. Existing methods like in-context learning and instruction tuning have significant limitations.

Method: Integrates reinforcement learning with multi-perspective reasoning to transform LLMs from passive extractors to active reasoners, enabling them to understand both what to extract and how to reason through the extraction process.

Result: MR-UIE consistently improves extraction accuracy across domains and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple IE benchmarks. Multi-perspective reasoning significantly enhances generalization in complex IE tasks.

Conclusion: The integration of reinforcement learning with multi-perspective reasoning is effective for improving LLM performance in information extraction, demonstrating the critical role of reasoning capabilities in challenging extraction scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate robust capabilities across diverse
research domains. However, their performance in universal information
extraction (UIE) remains insufficient, especially when tackling structured
output scenarios that involve complex schema descriptions and require
multi-step reasoning. While existing approaches enhance the performance of LLMs
through in-context learning and instruction tuning, significant limitations
nonetheless persist. To enhance the model's generalization ability, we propose
integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with multi-perspective reasoning for
information extraction (IE) tasks. Our work transitions LLMs from passive
extractors to active reasoners, enabling them to understand not only what to
extract but also how to reason. Experiments conducted on multiple IE benchmarks
demonstrate that MR-UIE consistently elevates extraction accuracy across
domains and surpasses state-of-the-art methods on several datasets.
Furthermore, incorporating multi-perspective reasoning into RL notably enhances
generalization in complex IE tasks, underscoring the critical role of reasoning
in challenging scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bangla is the 5th most spoken language but remains underrepresented in LLMs for code generation due to scarcity of high-quality training data.

Method: Created comprehensive Bangla code instruction datasets, developed MBPP-Bangla evaluation benchmark, and built TigerCoder-family models through domain adaptation.

Result: Achieved ~11-18% performance gains at Pass@1 over existing multilingual and general-purpose Bangla LLMs.

Conclusion: Curated high-quality datasets can overcome limitations of smaller models for low-resource languages, enabling effective code generation in underrepresented languages like Bangla.

Abstract: Despite being the 5th most spoken language, Bangla remains underrepresented
in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for code generation. This
primarily stems from the scarcity of high-quality data to pre-train and/or
finetune such models. Hence, we introduce the first dedicated family of Code
LLMs for Bangla (1B & 9B). We offer three major contributions: (1) a
comprehensive Bangla code instruction datasets for programming domain
adaptation; (2) MBPP-Bangla, an evaluation benchmark for Bangla code
generation; and (3) the TigerCoder-family of Code LLMs, achieving significant
~11-18% performance gains at Pass@1 over existing multilingual and
general-purpose Bangla LLMs. Our findings show that curated, high-quality
datasets can overcome limitations of smaller models for low-resource languages.
We open-source all resources to advance further Bangla LLM research.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art e-commerce performance, surpassing DeepSeek-V3.1, GPT-4 series, and Qwen3-235B. Demonstrates strong multilingual capability across low-resource Southeast Asian languages (Indonesian, Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Malay, Tagalog) and Portuguese while maintaining competitive general benchmark performance.

Conclusion: Compass-v3 successfully addresses domain-specific challenges in e-commerce with specialized architecture and training, achieving superior performance and broad linguistic competence. It has been widely deployed in Shopee's platform, replacing over 70% of OpenAI's traffic, demonstrating practical industrial applicability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general-domain applications, yet their
performance often degrades in specialized tasks requiring domain-specific
knowledge. E-commerce is particularly challenging, as its data are noisy,
heterogeneous, multilingual, and highly dynamic. We present Compass-v3, a
vertical-domain Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 245B total parameters and
71B active per token, designed for Southeast Asian e-commerce. Compass-v3
adopts fewer but larger experts, combined with hardware-efficient
optimizations-such as intra-node expert parallelism and a customized memcpy
operator-to maximize GPU utilization. The model is trained on 12T tokens of
curated multilingual corpora and large-scale synthetic e-commerce instructions
using a mixed-training strategy. To enhance alignment, we propose
Optimal-Transport Direct Preference Optimization (OTPO), which captures
token-level distinctions and improves instruction adherence in
commerce-specific scenarios. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compass-v3
delivers state-of-the-art e-commerce performance, surpassing DeepSeek-V3.1,
GPT-4 series, and Qwen3-235B. Moreover, Compass-v3 demonstrates strong
multilingual capability across low-resource Southeast Asian languages
(Indonesian, Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Malay, Taglog) and Portuguese while
sustaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. It has already been
widely applied in Shopee's industrial-scale e-commerce platform and is
gradually replacing OpenAI's traffic, now accounting for over 70\% of total LLM
usage, highlighting its dual strengths in specialized commerce expertise and
broad linguistic competence.

Abstract: This study explores the use of generative AI for automating the
classification of tutors' Dialogue Acts (DAs), aiming to reduce the time and
effort required by traditional manual coding. This case study uses the
open-source CIMA corpus, in which tutors' responses are pre-annotated into four

TL;DR: LITcoder is an open-source library for building and benchmarking neural encoding models that standardizes the process of aligning continuous stimuli with brain data, providing modular tools for feature transformation, mapping, and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To lower technical barriers to encoding model implementation, facilitate systematic comparisons across models and datasets, foster methodological rigor, and accelerate development of high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

Method: Modular pipeline implementation covering methodological design choices including brain datasets, regions, stimulus features (neural-net-based and control), downsampling approaches, with built-in logging, plotting, and integration with experiment tracking platforms like Weights & Biases.

Result: Demonstrated scalability and versatility by fitting encoding models to three story listening datasets (LeBel et al., Narratives, Little Prince), identifying critical methodological choices for continuous fMRI data including accounting for all tokens in TR scans, hemodynamic lag effects, proper train-test splits, and head motion effects.

Conclusion: LITcoder successfully provides a flexible framework that enables researchers to easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core infrastructure, promoting methodological rigor and accelerating neuroscience research.

Abstract: We introduce LITcoder, an open-source library for building and benchmarking
neural encoding models. Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides
standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with
brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those
features onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the
resulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline
covering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can
easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core
infrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus
feature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling
approaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in
logging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms
such as Weights & Biases (W&B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility
of our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening
datasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore
the methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous
fMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR
scan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized),
incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize
information leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model
predictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model
implementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets,
fosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality
high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

### [92] [Target-oriented Multimodal Sentiment Classification with Counterfactual-enhanced Debiasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09160)
*Zhiyue Liu,Fanrong Ma,Xin Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework for target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification that reduces spurious correlations between text features and labels by using counterfactual data augmentation and adaptive debiasing contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods over-rely on textual content and fail to address dataset biases, particularly word-level contextual biases, leading to spurious correlations that impair classification accuracy.

Method: Proposes a counterfactual data augmentation strategy that minimally alters sentiment-related causal features to generate detail-matched image-text samples, combined with an adaptive debiasing contrastive learning mechanism to learn robust features and mitigate biased word influence.

Result: Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces spurious correlations and improves sentiment classification accuracy by guiding model attention toward sentiment-related content through counterfactual enhancement and contrastive learning.

Abstract: Target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification seeks to predict
sentiment polarity for specific targets from image-text pairs. While existing
works achieve competitive performance, they often over-rely on textual content
and fail to consider dataset biases, in particular word-level contextual
biases. This leads to spurious correlations between text features and output
labels, impairing classification accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel
counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework to reduce such spurious
correlations. Our framework incorporates a counterfactual data augmentation
strategy that minimally alters sentiment-related causal features, generating
detail-matched image-text samples to guide the model's attention toward content
tied to sentiment. Furthermore, for learning robust features from
counterfactual data and prompting model decisions, we introduce an adaptive
debiasing contrastive learning mechanism, which effectively mitigates the
influence of biased words. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets
show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLLMs derived from text LLMs suffer from degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities due to failure to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap in feature representation space.

Method: Proposes EchoX which leverages semantic representations and dynamically generates speech training targets, integrating both acoustic and semantic learning.

Result: Achieves advanced performance on multiple knowledge-based question-answering benchmarks with about six thousand hours of training data.

Conclusion: EchoX effectively bridges the acoustic-semantic gap, enabling speech LLMs to preserve strong reasoning abilities while handling speech inputs and outputs.

Abstract: Speech-to-speech large language models (SLLMs) are attracting increasing
attention. Derived from text-based large language models (LLMs), SLLMs often
exhibit degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize
that this limitation arises because current training paradigms for SLLMs fail
to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap in the feature representation space. To
address this issue, we propose EchoX, which leverages semantic representations
and dynamically generates speech training targets. This approach integrates
both acoustic and semantic learning, enabling EchoX to preserve strong
reasoning abilities as a speech LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that
EchoX, with about six thousand hours of training data, achieves advanced
performance on multiple knowledge-based question-answering benchmarks. The

### [94] [Efficient Trie-based Biasing using K-step Prediction for Rare Word Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09196)
*Chin Yuen Kwok,Jia Qi yip*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a look-ahead multi-step prediction method for ASR contextual biasing that eliminates the need for bonus revocation in Trie-based approaches, achieving significant WER reduction on rare words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trie-based biasing in ASR requires computationally expensive revocation of bonus scores when rare words aren't fully recognized, especially problematic for large decoder models.

Method: Adapt ASR models to predict multiple steps ahead through fine-tuning, avoiding revocation by better estimating if partial hypotheses will lead to full rare word generation. Fine-tuned Whisper with 10 hours of synthetic data.

Result: Reduced word error rate on NSC Part 2 test set from 30.86% to 12.19%.

Conclusion: Look-ahead multi-step prediction effectively overcomes limitations of traditional Trie-based biasing, providing more efficient and accurate rare word recognition without computational revocation costs.

Abstract: Contextual biasing improves rare word recognition of ASR models by
prioritizing the output of rare words during decoding. A common approach is
Trie-based biasing, which gives "bonus scores" to partial hypothesis (e.g.
"Bon") that may lead to the generation of the rare word (e.g. "Bonham"). If the
full word ("Bonham") isn't ultimately recognized, the system revokes those
earlier bonuses. This revocation is limited to beam search and is
computationally expensive, particularly for models with large decoders. To
overcome these limitations, we propose adapting ASR models to look ahead and
predict multiple steps at once. This avoids the revocation step entirely by
better estimating whether a partial hypothesis will lead to the generation of
the full rare word. By fine-tuning Whisper with only 10 hours of synthetic
data, our method reduces the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from
30.86% to 12.19%.

*Chin Yuen Kwok,Jia Qi Yip,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Improved contextual biasing for ASR rare word recognition using keyword-aware loss with masked cross-entropy and binary classification terms, reducing WER from 29.71% to 11.81% on synthetic data adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address overfitting in contextual biasing modules when trained on synthetic rare word data, which contains audio artifacts that can degrade performance.

Method: Enhanced TCPGen-based contextual biasing with keyword-aware loss function combining masked cross-entropy for biased word prediction and binary classification for detecting biased word positions.

Result: Adapting Whisper to 10 hours of synthetic data reduced word error rate on NSC Part 2 test set from 29.71% to 11.81%.

Conclusion: The proposed keyword-aware loss function effectively improves rare word recognition by complementary training of biasing modules, mitigating overfitting from synthetic data artifacts.

Abstract: Rare word recognition can be improved by adapting ASR models to synthetic
data that includes these words. Further improvements can be achieved through
contextual biasing, which trains and adds a biasing module into the model
architecture to prioritize rare words. While training the module on synthetic
rare word data is more effective than using non-rare-word data, it can lead to
overfitting due to artifacts in the synthetic audio. To address this, we
enhance the TCPGen-based contextual biasing approach and propose a
keyword-aware loss function that additionally focuses on biased words when
training biasing modules. This loss includes a masked cross-entropy term for
biased word prediction and a binary classification term for detecting biased
word positions. These two terms complementarily support the decoding of biased
words during inference. By adapting Whisper to 10 hours of synthetic data, our
method reduced the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from 29.71% to
11.81%.

*Talia Sternberg,Michael London,David Omer,Yossi Adi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GmSLM is a generative spoken language model pipeline optimized for Marmoset monkey vocal communication, using unsupervised wild data and weak labels to generate realistic vocalizations that match real samples acoustically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marmoset monkeys show complex vocal communication similar to human speech features like vocal labeling and turn-taking, offering a unique opportunity to study brain activity related to vocal communication since human brain access is difficult in speech research.

Method: Developed Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM) pipeline with novel zero-shot evaluation metrics using unsupervised in-the-wild data and weakly labeled conversational data, comparing against human-speech-based baselines.

Result: GmSLM generated vocalizations closely matched real resynthesized samples acoustically, performed well on downstream tasks, and effectively distinguished real from artificial conversations despite being fully unsupervised.

Conclusion: GmSLM provides a practical framework linking vocalization and brain activity, potentially benefiting future neuroscience, bioacoustics, and evolutionary biology research on the neural basis of vocal communication.

Abstract: Marmoset monkeys exhibit complex vocal communication, challenging the view
that nonhuman primates vocal communication is entirely innate, and show similar
features of human speech, such as vocal labeling of others and turn-taking.
Studying their vocal communication offers a unique opportunity to link it with
brain activity-especially given the difficulty of accessing the human brain in
speech and language research. Since Marmosets communicate primarily through
vocalizations, applying standard LLM approaches is not straightforward. We
introduce Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM), an optimized
spoken language model pipeline for Marmoset vocal communication. We designed a
novel zero-shot evaluation metrics using unsupervised in-the-wild data,
alongside weakly labeled conversational data, to assess GmSLM and demonstrate
its advantage over a basic human-speech-based baseline. GmSLM generated
vocalizations closely matched real resynthesized samples acoustically and
performed well on downstream tasks. Despite being fully unsupervised, GmSLM
effectively distinguish real from artificial conversations and may support
further investigations of the neural basis of vocal communication and provides
a practical framework linking vocalization and brain activity. We believe GmSLM
stands to benefit future work in neuroscience, bioacoustics, and evolutionary
biology. Samples are provided under: pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/GmSLM.

*Wenhao Li,Bangcheng Sun,Weihao Ye,Tianyi Zhang,Daohai Yu,Fei Chao,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CCF is a context compression framework that enables efficient long-context modeling through hierarchical latent representations and semantic aggregation, achieving competitive performance with high compression ratios while improving throughput and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling language models to longer contexts is essential but imposes significant computational and memory burdens. Naive context extension results in inefficiencies during both training and inference, creating a need for more efficient approaches.

Method: CCF integrates segment-wise semantic aggregation with key-value memory encoding to form compact representations. It uses a training-efficient optimization strategy with incremental segment decoding and sparse reservoir sampling to reduce memory overhead without performance degradation.

Result: Empirical results show CCF achieves competitive perplexity under high compression ratios and significantly improves throughput and memory efficiency compared to existing approaches on multiple long-context language modeling benchmarks.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of structured compression for scalable and effective long-context language modeling, demonstrating that CCF successfully addresses computational and memory efficiency challenges while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Scaling language models to longer contexts is essential for capturing rich
dependencies across extended discourse. However, na\"ive context extension
imposes significant computational and memory burdens, often resulting in
inefficiencies during both training and inference. In this work, we propose
CCF, a novel context compression framework designed to enable efficient
long-context modeling by learning hierarchical latent representations that
preserve global semantics while aggressively reducing input redundancy. CCF
integrates segment-wise semantic aggregation with key-value memory encoding,
forming compact representations that support accurate reconstruction and
long-range understanding. To further enhance scalability, we introduce a
training-efficient optimization strategy that couples incremental segment
decoding with sparse reservoir sampling, substantially reducing memory overhead
without degrading performance. Empirical results on multiple long-context
language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that CCF achieves competitive
perplexity under high compression ratios, and significantly improves throughput
and memory efficiency compared to existing approaches. These findings highlight
the potential of structured compression for scalable and effective long-context
language modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate seniority assessment from resumes is challenging due to overstated experience and ambiguous self-presentation, requiring automated solutions to handle these complexities.

Method: Used large language models including fine-tuned BERT architectures, evaluated on a hybrid dataset containing real-world resumes and synthetically generated hard examples simulating exaggerated qualifications.

Result: Models demonstrated effectiveness in detecting subtle linguistic cues associated with seniority inflation and implicit expertise, showing promising performance in automated candidate evaluation.

Conclusion: The approach provides promising directions for enhancing AI-driven candidate evaluation systems and mitigating bias from self-promotional language, with the dataset made available for research community use.

Abstract: Accurately assessing candidate seniority from resumes is a critical yet
challenging task, complicated by the prevalence of overstated experience and
ambiguous self-presentation. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of
large language models (LLMs), including fine-tuned BERT architectures, for
automating seniority classification in resumes. To rigorously evaluate model
performance, we introduce a hybrid dataset comprising both real-world resumes
and synthetically generated hard examples designed to simulate exaggerated
qualifications and understated seniority. Using the dataset, we evaluate the
performance of Large Language Models in detecting subtle linguistic cues
associated with seniority inflation and implicit expertise. Our findings
highlight promising directions for enhancing AI-driven candidate evaluation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Table QA faces challenges due to diverse table structures, sizes, and data types in real-world scenarios, requiring robust methods to handle structured query answering.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline using LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek v2:16b) for NL-to-SQL conversion with example selection, SQL generation, answer extraction, verification, and iterative refinement.

Result: Achieved 70.5% accuracy on DataBench QA and 71.6% on DataBench Lite QA, significantly surpassing baseline scores of 26% and 27% respectively.

Conclusion: LLM-driven Table QA shows strong performance but has limitations; the approach provides valuable insights for structured data question answering systems.

Abstract: Question Answering over Tabular Data (Table QA) presents unique challenges
due to the diverse structure, size, and data types of real-world tables. The
SemEval 2025 Task 8 (DataBench) introduced a benchmark composed of large-scale,
domain-diverse datasets to evaluate the ability of models to accurately answer
structured queries. We propose a Natural Language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approach
leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and
DeepSeek v2:16b to generate SQL queries dynamically. Our system follows a
multi-stage pipeline involving example selection, SQL query generation, answer
extraction, verification, and iterative refinement. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, achieving 70.5\% accuracy on DataBench QA and
71.6\% on DataBench Lite QA, significantly surpassing baseline scores of 26\%
and 27\% respectively. This paper details our methodology, experimental
results, and alternative approaches, providing insights into the strengths and

*Grazia Sveva Ascione,Nicolò Tamagnone*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Weak supervision framework using LLMs and patent citations to classify patents for UN SDGs, outperforming baselines and showing better thematic coherence than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of large labeled datasets limits supervised learning for patent-to-SDG classification, while existing methods like keyword searches lack scalability and generalizability.

Method: Uses weak supervision with NPL citations as noisy signal, develops composite labeling function with LLMs to extract structured concepts, computes cross-domain similarity with rank-based retrieval, and calibrates via positive-only loss.

Result: Creates silver-standard multi-label dataset, outperforms transformer models and zero-shot LLM in validation, shows greater thematic coherence in citation and collaboration networks than traditional classifications.

Conclusion: Weak supervision and semantic alignment can effectively scale SDG patent classification, enabling better tracking of innovation addressing global challenges.

Abstract: Classifying patents by their relevance to the UN Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) is crucial for tracking how innovation addresses global
challenges. However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of
supervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer
learning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability.
This paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem,
using citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL
citations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we
develop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models
(LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and
applications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology.
Cross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based
retrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that
aligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG
associations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping
patents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression
models. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1)
internal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method
outperforms several baselines including transformer-based models, and zero-shot
LLM; and (2) external validation using network modularity in patent citation,
co-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic,
cognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological
classifications. These results show that weak supervision and semantic
alignment can enhance SDG classification at scale.

### [101] [MetaRAG: Metamorphic Testing for Hallucination Detection in RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09360)
*Channdeth Sok,David Luz,Yacine Haddam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MetaRAG is a metamorphic testing framework that detects hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by decomposing answers into factoids, generating mutations, verifying against retrieved context, and scoring inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination detection methods like SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA don't address RAG systems' unique challenges where responses must align with retrieved evidence, creating reliability issues for enterprise LLM deployments.

Method: Four-stage framework: (1) decompose answers into atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations using synonym/antonym substitutions, (3) verify variants against retrieved context (synonyms should be entailed, antonyms contradicted), (4) aggregate penalties into response-level hallucination scores with span-level localization.

Result: Effective hallucination detection on proprietary enterprise datasets, enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based conversational agents with identity-aware safeguards for sensitive queries.

Conclusion: MetaRAG provides real-time, unsupervised black-box testing for RAG systems without requiring ground truth or model access, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes domains with identity-sensitive content.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e.,
confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches,
such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not
address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,
where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore
present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time,
unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor
access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes
domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into
atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using
synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the
retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms
contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a
response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG
localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g.,
pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility),
allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure
thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a
proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for
detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based
conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that
translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this
design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.

TL;DR: This paper connects cognitive science theories of analogical reasoning to NLP research, showing how cognitive processes can improve relational understanding in text beyond entity-level similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge cognitive science theories about analogical reasoning with current NLP research, as these cognitive processes are not typically viewed through a cognitive lens in NLP despite their relevance.

Method: Summarizes key theories about analogical reasoning processes from cognitive science literature and relates them to concepts in natural language processing.

Result: Shows how cognitive notions of analogical reasoning are relevant for several major challenges in NLP research beyond just analogy solving.

Conclusion: Applying cognitive perspectives on analogical reasoning can guide NLP researchers to better optimize relational understanding in text rather than relying heavily on entity-level similarity.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is an essential aspect of human cognition. In this
paper, we summarize key theory about the processes underlying analogical
reasoning from the cognitive science literature and relate it to current
research in natural language processing. While these processes can be easily
linked to concepts in NLP, they are generally not viewed through a cognitive
lens. Furthermore, we show how these notions are relevant for several major
challenges in NLP research, not directly related to analogy solving. This may
guide researchers to better optimize relational understanding in text, as
opposed to relying heavily on entity-level similarity.

TL;DR: Hierarchical bracketing encodings enable linear-time dependency graph parsing with n tagging actions while handling reentrancies, cycles, and empty nodes, reducing label space while maintaining structural information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a practical approach for dependency graph parsing that can efficiently handle complex graph structures like reentrancies and cycles while reducing computational complexity compared to existing methods.

Method: Encodes dependency graphs as sequences using hierarchical bracketing encodings, allowing linear-time parsing with n tagging actions. The method preserves structural information while substantially reducing the label space.

Result: Competitive results on a multilingual and multi-formalism benchmark, with consistent improvements over other methods in exact match accuracy.

Conclusion: Hierarchical bracketing encodings provide an effective and efficient approach for dependency graph parsing, offering practical advantages in terms of reduced computational complexity and improved accuracy compared to existing graph linearization methods.

Abstract: We revisit hierarchical bracketing encodings from a practical perspective in
the context of dependency graph parsing. The approach encodes graphs as
sequences, enabling linear-time parsing with $n$ tagging actions, and still
representing reentrancies, cycles, and empty nodes. Compared to existing graph
linearizations, this representation substantially reduces the label space while
preserving structural information. We evaluate it on a multilingual and
multi-formalism benchmark, showing competitive results and consistent
improvements over other methods in exact match accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GrACE is a novel confidence elicitation method for LLMs that uses hidden state similarity to a special token for real-time, scalable confidence estimation without additional sampling or auxiliary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing confidence elicitation methods for LLMs are either computationally expensive or poorly calibrated, making them impractical for real-world deployment in high-stakes applications like healthcare and finance.

Method: GrACE appends a special token to the vocabulary and measures confidence through similarity between the last hidden state and this token's embedding. The model is fine-tuned with calibration targets associated with accuracy.

Result: Experiments with three LLMs and two benchmark datasets show GrACE achieves best discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks, outperforming six competing methods. It also reduces required samples in test-time scaling.

Conclusion: GrACE provides a practical solution for deploying LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation, improving accuracy while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Assessing the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by confidence
elicitation is a prominent approach to AI safety in high-stakes applications,
such as healthcare and finance. Existing methods either require expensive
computational overhead or suffer from poor calibration, making them impractical
and unreliable for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose GrACE, a
Generative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and
reliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in
which the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden
state and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in
real-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with
calibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and
two benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the
best discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks,
outperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or
an auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time
scaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that
using GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also
significantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling
scheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying
LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-supervised hybrid architecture combining sentence embeddings with knowledge graphs improves job title matching, with 25% RMSE reduction in high semantic relatedness regions through stratified evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced text relationships beyond lexical similarity, crucial for job title matching in resume recommendation systems where overlapping terms are limited or misleading.

Method: Self-supervised hybrid architecture combining dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) using graph neural networks, with stratified evaluation partitioning STR scores into low, medium, and high relatedness regions.

Result: Fine-tuned SBERT models augmented with KGs produced consistent improvements in high-STR region, reducing RMSE by 25% over strong baselines, revealing hidden model strengths and weaknesses through regional analysis.

Conclusion: Combining KGs with text embeddings provides significant benefits, and regional performance analysis is essential for understanding model behavior, supporting targeted model selection for HR systems requiring fairness, explainability, and contextual matching.

Abstract: Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced relationships between
texts that extend beyond superficial lexical similarity. In this study, we
investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in
resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or
misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines
dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to
improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that
evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data
stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions:
low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables
a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful
subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG
integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT
models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR
region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings
highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also
the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model
behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by
global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human
Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and
contextual matching are essential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop effective methods for predicting perspectivist annotations (annotator-specific labels) and soft labels in learning with disagreements scenarios.

Method: Two main approaches: (1) In-context learning with large language models comparing example sampling strategies, and (2) Label distribution learning methods with RoBERTa using several fine-tuning techniques.

Result: ICL effectively predicts annotator-specific annotations, and aggregating these predictions into soft labels achieves competitive performance. LDL methods show promise for soft label prediction.

Conclusion: Both ICL and LDL methods are valuable for perspectivist annotation tasks, with LDL particularly promising for soft label predictions and deserving further exploration by the community.

Abstract: This system paper presents the DeMeVa team's approaches to the third edition
of the Learning with Disagreements shared task (LeWiDi 2025; Leonardelli et
al., 2025). We explore two directions: in-context learning (ICL) with large
language models, where we compare example sampling strategies; and label
distribution learning (LDL) methods with RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), where we
evaluate several fine-tuning methods. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we
show that ICL can effectively predict annotator-specific annotations
(perspectivist annotations), and that aggregating these predictions into soft
labels yields competitive performance; and (2) we argue that LDL methods are
promising for soft label predictions and merit further exploration by the
perspectivist community.

TL;DR: Researchers developed a personality detection model using GPT's zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five traits from forum posts, integrated it into SAMI's matchmaking system to provide personality-informed social recommendations for online students.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online course environments create barriers to organic social group formation, and existing systems like SAMI have limited effectiveness due to incomplete Theory of Mind and inability to intuit personality traits that could improve recommendation relevance.

Method: Proposed a personality detection model using GPT's zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from student forum introduction posts, benchmarked against established models, and integrated into SAMI's entity-based matchmaking system.

Result: The GPT-based personality detection model demonstrated efficacy in inferring personality traits from forum posts. Initial integration showed personality traits can complement existing matching factors in SAMI's recommendation system.

Conclusion: Personality-informed recommendations show promise for improving online student social connections, though additional evaluation is needed to determine their full impact on student engagement and match quality.

Abstract: Social connection is a vital part of learning, yet online course environments
present barriers to the organic formation of social groups. SAMI offers one
solution by facilitating student connections, but its effectiveness is
constrained by an incomplete Theory of Mind, limiting its ability to create an
effective mental model of a student. One facet of this is its inability to
intuit personality, which may influence the relevance of its recommendations.
To explore this, we propose a personality detection model utilizing GPTs
zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from forum
introduction posts, often encouraged in online courses. We benchmark its
performance against established models, demonstrating its efficacy in this
task. Furthermore, we integrate this model into SAMIs entity-based matchmaking
system, enabling personality-informed social recommendations. Initial
integration suggests personality traits can complement existing matching
factors, though additional evaluation is required to determine their full
impact on student engagement and match quality.

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with fine-grained emotion alignment despite good performance on broad emotion categories. EXPRESS benchmark reveals limitations in capturing nuanced human emotions from context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLMs can align with human emotions at a fine-grained level, addressing the gap in existing research that focuses only on broad emotion classification categories.

Method: Created EXPRESS benchmark dataset with 251 fine-grained emotion labels from Reddit communities. Evaluated prevalent LLMs under various prompt settings, decomposing emotions into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories.

Result: LLMs find it challenging to accurately predict emotions that align with human self-disclosed emotions. While some generate theoretically consistent emotion terms, they often fail to capture contextual cues effectively compared to human self-disclosures.

Conclusion: LLMs have significant limitations in fine-grained emotion alignment, highlighting the need for future research to enhance their contextual understanding capabilities for mental health applications.

Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language
understanding has made them increasingly popular in mental health research.
While many studies explore LLMs' capabilities in emotion recognition, a
critical gap remains in evaluating whether LLMs align with human emotions at a
fine-grained level. Existing research typically focuses on classifying emotions
into predefined, limited categories, overlooking more nuanced expressions. To
address this gap, we introduce EXPRESS, a benchmark dataset curated from Reddit
communities featuring 251 fine-grained, self-disclosed emotion labels. Our
comprehensive evaluation framework examines predicted emotion terms and
decomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories,
enabling a fine-grained comparison. Systematic testing of prevalent LLMs under
various prompt settings reveals that accurately predicting emotions that align
with human self-disclosed emotions remains challenging. Qualitative analysis
further shows that while certain LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with
established emotion theories and definitions, they sometimes fail to capture

highlight the limitations of LLMs in fine-grained emotion alignment and offer

Abstract: Verbal autopsy (VA) is a critical tool for estimating causes of death in
resource-limited settings where medical certification is unavailable. This
study presents LA-VA, a proof-of-concept pipeline that combines Large Language
Models (LLMs) with traditional algorithmic approaches and embedding-based
classification for improved cause-of-death prediction. Using the Population
Health Metrics Research Consortium (PHMRC) dataset across three age categories
(Adult: 7,580; Child: 1,960; Neonate: 2,438), we evaluate multiple approaches:
GPT-5 predictions, LCVA baseline, text embeddings, and meta-learner ensembles.
Our results demonstrate that GPT-5 achieves the highest individual performance
with average test site accuracies of 48.6% (Adult), 50.5% (Child), and 53.5%
(Neonate), outperforming traditional statistical machine learning baselines by
5-10%. Our findings suggest that simple off-the-shelf LLM-assisted approaches
could substantially improve verbal autopsy accuracy, with important
implications for global health surveillance in low-resource settings.

### [112] [Bridging the Capability Gap: Joint Alignment Tuning for Harmonizing LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09629)
*Minghang Zhu,Zhengliang Shi,Zhiwei Xu,Shiguang Wu,Lingjie Wang,Pengjie Ren,Zhaochun Ren,Zhumin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOAT is a joint alignment tuning framework that improves collaboration between planning and grounding agents in multi-agent LLM systems through iterative optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fine-tune planning and grounding agents independently, leading to capability gaps and poor coordination between them, which hinders effective task solving.

Method: MOAT alternates between two stages: Planning Agent Alignment (optimizes subgoal generation to better guide grounding agent) and Grounding Agent Improving (fine-tunes using diverse subgoal-action pairs for better generalization).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across six benchmarks with average improvements of 3.1% on held-in tasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks.

Conclusion: MOAT's iterative joint alignment approach effectively bridges capability gaps between agents, ensuring non-decreasing convergent training and significantly improving multi-agent collaboration performance.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the construction
of multi-agent systems to solve complex tasks by dividing responsibilities
among specialized agents, such as a planning agent for subgoal generation and a
grounding agent for executing tool-use actions. Most existing methods typically
fine-tune these agents independently, leading to capability gaps among them
with poor coordination. To address this, we propose MOAT, a Multi-Agent Joint
Alignment Tuning framework that improves agents collaboration through iterative
alignment. MOAT alternates between two key stages: (1) Planning Agent
Alignment, which optimizes the planning agent to generate subgoal sequences
that better guide the grounding agent; and (2) Grounding Agent Improving, which
fine-tunes the grounding agent using diverse subgoal-action pairs generated by
the agent itself to enhance its generalization capablity. Theoretical analysis
proves that MOAT ensures a non-decreasing and progressively convergent training
process. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that MOAT outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 3.1% on held-in
tasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks.

*Siddarth Mamidanna,Daking Rai,Ziyu Yao,Yilun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies a specific computational subgraph (AF1) in LLMs that handles mental math tasks, where meaningful computation occurs late and only at the last token using specific information transfer mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs actually perform computations internally, particularly for mental math tasks, despite their theoretical capability to access all preceding tokens through attention mechanisms.

Method: Used Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and Attention-Based Peeking (ABP) techniques to inhibit computations in initial layers, restrict information transfer routes, and force computation at the last token to identify the All-for-One (AF1) subgraph.

Result: Identified a sufficient and necessary AF1 subgraph that achieves high accuracy on mental math tasks, transfers across different models, and works with various input styles. The subgraph performs computation very late and only at the last token using specific middle layers.

Conclusion: LLMs use a specific computational pattern for mental math where meaningful computation happens late and only at the final token position, receiving information from other tokens through specific middle layers, revealing insights about their internal computation mechanisms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate proficiency across numerous
computational tasks, yet their inner workings remain unclear. In theory, the
combination of causal self-attention and multilayer perceptron layers allows
every token to access and compute information based on all preceding tokens. In
practice, to what extent are such operations present? In this paper, on mental
math tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without
explicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting
input-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes
of information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and
forcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.
With two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and
Attention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with
high accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful
computation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last
token, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle
layers. Experiments on a variety of models and arithmetic expressions show that
this subgraph is sufficient and necessary for high model performance, transfers
across different models, and works on a variety of input styles. Ablations on
different CAMA and ABP alternatives reveal their unique advantages over other
methods, which may be of independent interest.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SteerMoE is a framework that controls behavior in MoE LLMs by detecting and steering experts linked to specific behaviors like safety and faithfulness, achieving significant improvements without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for controlling specific behaviors (safety, faithfulness) in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs without requiring model retraining or weight modifications.

Method: Detects experts with distinct activation patterns across paired inputs with contrasting behaviors, then selectively activates/deactivates these experts during inference to steer model behavior.

Result: Across 11 benchmarks and 6 LLMs: +20% safety improvement, +27% faithfulness improvement. In adversarial mode: -41% safety alone, -100% when combined with jailbreak methods, bypassing all safety guardrails.

Conclusion: SteerMoE effectively controls MoE model behaviors without retraining, but also reveals a new vulnerability - alignment faking hidden within experts that can be exploited to bypass safety measures.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models (LLMs) routes each token
through a subset of specialized Feed-Forward Networks (FFN), known as experts.
We present SteerMoE, a framework for steering MoE models by detecting and
controlling behavior-linked experts. Our detection method identifies experts
with distinct activation patterns across paired inputs exhibiting contrasting
behaviors. By selectively (de)activating such experts during inference, we
control behaviors like faithfulness and safety without retraining or modifying
weights. Across 11 benchmarks and 6 LLMs, our steering raises safety by up to
+20% and faithfulness by +27%. In adversarial attack mode, it drops safety by
-41% alone, and -100% when combined with existing jailbreak methods, bypassing
all safety guardrails and exposing a new dimension of alignment faking hidden
within experts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Curiosity-Driven Exploration (CDE) framework addresses exploration issues in RLVR by using actor perplexity and critic variance as intrinsic rewards, achieving +3 point improvement on AIME benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods suffer from poor exploration, premature convergence, and entropy collapse, limiting LLM reasoning capabilities.

Method: Uses actor's perplexity over generated responses and critic's value estimate variance from multi-head architecture as curiosity-driven exploration bonuses within RLVR framework.

Result: Achieves approximately +3 point improvement over standard RLVR methods (GRPO/PPO) on AIME benchmarks and identifies calibration collapse mechanism in LLMs.

Conclusion: CDE effectively enhances exploration in RLVR through intrinsic curiosity signals, providing both theoretical grounding and empirical improvements while revealing important LLM failure modes.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet
current RLVR methods often explore poorly, leading to premature convergence and
entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we introduce Curiosity-Driven
Exploration (CDE), a framework that leverages the model's own intrinsic sense
of curiosity to guide exploration. We formalize curiosity with signals from
both the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its
generated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates
from a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus
within the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and
promotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the
critic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.
Empirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over
standard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks. Further analysis identifies a
calibration collapse mechanism within RLVR, shedding light on common LLM
failure modes.

### [116] [An Interval Type-2 Version of Bayes Theorem Derived from Interval Probability Range Estimates Provided by Subject Matter Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08834)
*John T. Rickard,William A. Dembski,James Rickards*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Develops an interval type-2 version of Bayes Theorem to handle uncertainty in input probabilities provided as interval estimates from subject matter experts, with a conservative method to avoid inconsistencies and a novel algorithm for encoding intervals into fuzzy membership functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Bayesian inference assumes precise input values, which is unrealistic for real-world applications where subject matter experts typically provide interval range estimates rather than exact probabilities.

Method: Develops an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem with a conservative method to avoid input inconsistencies, and creates a novel algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into interval type-2 fuzzy membership functions.

Result: Provides a framework that extends Bayesian inference to handle interval uncertainty in input probabilities while maintaining valid output results.

Conclusion: The proposed IT2 Bayes Theorem and interval encoding algorithm enable more realistic Bayesian analysis using expert-provided interval estimates, addressing the limitations of traditional precise-input assumptions.

Abstract: Bayesian inference is widely used in many different fields to test hypotheses
against observations. In most such applications, an assumption is made of
precise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is
unrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information
from subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates
of the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two
key contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version.
First, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and
conservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs
that otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel
and flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy
membership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities
in Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this
problem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for
Computing with Words applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent LLM framework that decomposes MiniZinc model generation by constraint type, with specialized agents for different global constraints and an assembler agent, showing improved performance over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language descriptions of optimization problems are difficult to translate into correct MiniZinc models due to the need for both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise.

Method: Multiple specialized LLM agents each handle specific global constraint types, with a final assembler agent integrating constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model.

Result: Initial experiments show better performance compared to baselines like one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting.

Conclusion: The agentic approach effectively decomposes complex modeling tasks, and future work includes potential enhancements and improvements to the framework.

Abstract: Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are
challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands
both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce a
framework that addresses this challenge with an agentic approach: multiple
specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by
global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating
code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent
integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By
dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a
simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We
conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance
against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting.
Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting
potential enhancements and directions for improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Truncated Cross Entropy (TCE) loss function to mitigate model collapse in generative AI by downweighting high-confidence predictions during training on synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing reliance on generative AI models leads to synthetic data dominating training datasets by 2030, causing model collapse where performance degrades over generations of training on synthetic data. Existing mitigation strategies are limited.

Method: Identifies model overconfidence in self-generated data as key driver of collapse. Proposes confidence-aware loss function (TCE) that downweights high-confidence predictions. Provides model-agnostic framework linking loss function design to collapse mitigation.

Result: TCE significantly delays model collapse in recursive training, extending model's fidelity interval before collapse by more than 2.3x. Method generalizes across different modalities.

Conclusion: Loss function design provides a simple yet powerful tool for preserving generative model quality in the era of increasing synthetic data, with TCE offering an effective mitigation strategy against model collapse.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on generative AI models has accelerated the
generation rate of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most
available new data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift
to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training
in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model
performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the
models ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and
detection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.
  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data
as a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a
confidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions
during training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross
Entropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in
recursive training.
  We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to
model collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and
empirically, showing that it can extend the model's fidelity interval before
collapse by more than 2.3x. Finally, we show that our method generalizes across
modalities. These findings suggest that the design of loss functions provides a
simple yet powerful tool for preserving the quality of generative models in the
era of increasing synthetic data.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes explainable AI (XAI) with focus on uncertainty explanations and global explanations, testing algorithms that combine uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI concepts to calibrate user trust and satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While XAI is well-studied in some areas, uncertainty explanations and global explanations are often overlooked. The researchers aim to address this gap by examining how algorithms that provide intuitive visual understanding can improve user satisfaction and interpretability.

Method: The researchers selected an algorithm that simultaneously covers uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI concepts. They tested its ability to calibrate trust and evaluated whether complex algorithms with intuitive visual representations can provide higher user satisfaction and human interpretability.

Result: The study examined the effectiveness of algorithms that provide uncertainty explanations and global explanations, particularly focusing on their impact on trust calibration, user satisfaction, and interpretability.

Conclusion: The research contributes to XAI guidelines by demonstrating the importance of uncertainty and global explanations, and shows that algorithms with intuitive visual representations can enhance user satisfaction and interpretability despite their complexity.

Abstract: Explainable AI has become a common term in the literature, scrutinized by
computer scientists and statisticians and highlighted by psychological or
philosophical researchers. One major effort many researchers tackle is
constructing general guidelines for XAI schemes, which we derived from our
study. While some areas of XAI are well studied, we focus on uncertainty
explanations and consider global explanations, which are often left out. We
chose an algorithm that covers various concepts simultaneously, such as
uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI, and tested its ability to calibrate
trust. We then checked whether an algorithm that aims to provide more of an
intuitive visual understanding, despite being complicated to understand, can
provide higher user satisfaction and human interpretability.

*Haowei Yang,Yushang Zhao,Sitao Min,Bo Su,Chao Yao,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a prompt formulation method P(u, Ds) → R̂ to address cold-start user issues in LLM-based recommender systems, showing that optimal exemplar injection and instruction structuring significantly improves precision@k and NDCG scores in low-data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cold-start users lack historical behavioral information, which compromises recommender system effectiveness. The paper aims to address this issue through prompt optimization on few-shot LLMs for recommendation tasks.

Method: Proposes context-conditioned prompt formulation P(u, Ds) → R̂ where u is cold-start user profile, Ds is curated support set. Uses transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2, GPT-4) with token-level alignments and embedding space regularization for semantic fidelity.

Result: Empirical evidence shows optimal exemplar injection and instruction structuring significantly improve precision@k and NDCG scores in low-data settings. Timely prompt composition controls attention scales and decoder conduct during inference.

Conclusion: Prompt-based adaptation is an effective approach to address cold-start recommendation issues in LLM-based pipelines, demonstrating that careful prompt design can overcome data scarcity challenges.

Abstract: The cold-start user issue further compromises the effectiveness of
recommender systems in limiting access to the historical behavioral
information. It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a
few-shot large language model (LLM) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a
context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\ Ds)\ \rightarrow\
R\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set,
and R\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic
experimentation with transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2,
GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and
instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG
scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level
alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity.
Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but
also functional as it is in direct control of attention scales and decoder
conduct through inference. This paper shows that prompt-based adaptation may be
considered one of the ways to address cold-start recommendation issues in
LLM-based pipelines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Comparison of humans, LLMs, and Bayesian agents in dynamic negotiation tasks shows performance parity can mask fundamental behavioral differences in process and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As autonomous agents increasingly handle coordination tasks traditionally done by humans, it's critical to evaluate not just their performance outcomes but also their negotiation processes and behavioral dynamics in multi-agent environments.

Method: Compared humans (N=216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in identical dynamic negotiation conditions, capturing both outcomes and behavioral dynamics.

Result: Bayesian agents achieved highest surplus through aggressive optimization but with frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs achieved similar overall surplus but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favored conservative concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans used more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented approaches.

Conclusion: Performance parity alone is insufficient for agent evaluation as it conceals fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.

Abstract: Coordination tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly being
delegated to autonomous agents. As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical
to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through
which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore,
different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents,
such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas
large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we
compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in
a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition
comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral
dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive
optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can
achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor
conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ
more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find
that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can
conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical
for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.

approach for developing ML pipelines to identify high-risk bank clients in a
dataset curated for Task 1 of the University of Toronto 2023-2024 Institute for
Management and Innovation (IMI) Big Data and Artificial Intelligence
Competition. The dataset included 195,789 customer IDs, and we employed a

robust. We also framed the data in a SQLite database, developed SQL-based
feature engineering algorithms, connected our pre-trained model to the
database, and made it inference-ready, and provided explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) modules to derive feature importance. Our pipeline achieved
a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.961
with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.005. The proposed pipeline achieved second
place in the competition.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a neuroscience-grounded computational framework for agentic spatial intelligence, identifying six essential modules inspired by biological spatial reasoning to bridge the gap between current AI systems and human-like spatial capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic AI systems have limited spatial reasoning abilities constrained to symbolic processing, while human spatial intelligence enables flexible decision-making in unstructured environments. Bridging this gap is critical for advancing AI interaction with the physical 3D world.

Method: The authors introduce a computational framework mapping biological functions to six modules: bio-inspired multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric conversion, artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning. They analyze existing methods against this framework and examine benchmarks.

Result: The paper provides a structured neuroscience-grounded perspective for agentic spatial reasoning, identifies critical gaps in current approaches, and explores application domains from virtual to embodied systems like robotics.

Conclusion: The framework offers a promising roadmap for generalizing spatial reasoning across dynamic environments and provides the research community with a structured pathway toward neuroscience-grounded spatial intelligence development.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task
execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities
remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and
sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in
integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables
flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.
Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial
Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,
we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in
computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational
framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core
biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired
multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric
conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.
Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial
reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we
conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their
relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the
development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further
examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application
domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we
outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that
can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.
We hope this work will benefit the research community with a
neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page

Motivation: Current multi-agent prediction methods overlook the evolving nature of interactions between agents, which is crucial for accurate motion prediction of surrounding agents in autonomous vehicle planning.

Method: Uses dynamic heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling with progressive multi-scale decoding. Features progressive modeling of scenarios with dynamic heterogeneous graphs to capture evolving social interactions, a factorized architecture for spatio-temporal dependencies, and multi-scale decoding for improved scenario modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, ranking 1st on the INTERACTION multi-agent prediction benchmark and performing well on the Argoverse 2 multi-world forecasting benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed ProgD method effectively addresses the limitation of evolving interactions in multi-agent prediction and demonstrates superior performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding agents is crucial for the safe
planning of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements have extended prediction
techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting
agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future
motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these
interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive
multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic
heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and
comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,
given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios
with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic
heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the
spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively
eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a
multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future
scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The
proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION
multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2
multi-world forecasting benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language model-powered autonomous agents offer significant opportunities but pose governance challenges due to unpredictable behaviors and heterogeneous capabilities, requiring systematic regulatory mechanisms.

Method: Proposes a blockchain-enabled layered architecture with three key modules: agent behavior tracing and arbitration, dynamic reputation evaluation, and malicious behavior forecasting for early detection of adversarial activities.

Result: The approach establishes a systematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory mechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems.

Conclusion: The paper presents a blockchain-based regulatory framework for multi-agent systems and discusses future research directions for such regulatory frameworks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered autonomous agents are transforming
both digital and physical environments by enabling adaptive, multi-agent
collaboration. While these agents offer significant opportunities across
domains such as finance, healthcare, and smart manufacturing, their
unpredictable behaviors and heterogeneous capabilities pose substantial
governance and accountability challenges. In this paper, we propose a
blockchain-enabled layered architecture for regulatory agent collaboration,
comprising an agent layer, a blockchain data layer, and a regulatory
application layer. Within this framework, we design three key modules: (i) an
agent behavior tracing and arbitration module for automated accountability,
(ii) a dynamic reputation evaluation module for trust assessment in
collaborative scenarios, and (iii) a malicious behavior forecasting module for
early detection of adversarial activities. Our approach establishes a
systematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory
mechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the future
research directions for blockchain-enabled regulatory frameworks in multi-agent
systems.

Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with multi-step reasoning and tool use in complex data analysis workflows, limiting their effectiveness in practical data science scenarios.

Method: Created NbQA dataset from real Jupyter notebooks, developed Jupiter framework using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for multi-step reasoning and value model learning to generate executable plans.

Result: Qwen2.5-7B and 14B-Instruct models achieved 77.82% and 86.38% task success rates on InfiAgent-DABench, matching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agent frameworks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly enhances LLMs' multi-step reasoning and tool-use capabilities for data analysis, demonstrating improved generalization across diverse reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
science workflows, but existing models still struggle with multi-step reasoning
and tool use, which limits their effectiveness on complex data analysis tasks.
To address this, we propose a scalable pipeline that extracts high-quality,
tool-based data analysis tasks and their executable multi-step solutions from
real-world Jupyter notebooks and associated data files. Using this pipeline, we
introduce NbQA, a large-scale dataset of standardized task-solution pairs that
reflect authentic tool-use patterns in practical data science scenarios. To
further enhance multi-step reasoning, we present Jupiter, a framework that
formulates data analysis as a search problem and applies Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate diverse solution trajectories for value model
learning. During inference, Jupiter combines the value model and node visit
counts to efficiently collect executable multi-step plans with minimal search
steps. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-7B and 14B-Instruct models on
NbQA solve 77.82% and 86.38% of tasks on InfiAgent-DABench,
respectively-matching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agent frameworks.
Further evaluations demonstrate improved generalization and stronger tool-use

Motivation: Traditional RAG approaches struggle with thematic and holistic understanding of complex texts, requiring deeper analysis of both text and context that knowledge graphs can provide.

Method: Comprehensive technical comparative study evaluating three open-source methodologies for constructing knowledge graph triplets and integrating them with LLMs for question answering.

Result: Experimental results show OpenIE provides the most comprehensive triplet coverage, while GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities among the three methods.

Conclusion: Discussion of strengths/limitations of each method with insights for future improvements in knowledge graph-based question answering systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs, a powerful tool for structuring information through
relational triplets, have recently become the new front-runner in enhancing
question-answering systems. While traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches are proficient in fact-based and local context-based
extraction from concise texts, they encounter limitations when addressing the
thematic and holistic understanding of complex, extensive texts, requiring a
deeper analysis of both text and context. This paper presents a comprehensive
technical comparative study of three different methodologies for constructing
knowledge graph triplets and integrating them with Large Language Models (LLMs)
for question answering: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE, and GraphRAG, all
leveraging open source technologies. We evaluate the effectiveness,
feasibility, and adaptability of these methods by analyzing their capabilities,
state of development, and their impact on the performance of LLM-based question
answering. Experimental results indicate that while OpenIE provides the most
comprehensive coverage of triplets, GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning
abilities among the three. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and
limitations of each method and provide insights into future directions for
improving knowledge graph-based question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage MCTS-generated intermediate trajectories from reasoning domains to enhance policy optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning, particularly for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Method: Proposed staged GRPO training paradigm using partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing tree-structured advantage estimation and prefix-conditioned reward signals.

Result: Initial results show structured advantage estimation stabilizes updates and better reflects compositional reasoning quality, but challenges like advantage saturation and reward signal collapse persist.

Conclusion: Heuristic and statistical solutions are proposed to mitigate issues, with ongoing challenges for learning under staged or tree-like reward structures.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the
effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality
intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired
by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories, traditionally used for
training value or reward models, can be repurposed to improve policy
optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we
focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that
enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We
propose a staged GRPO training paradigm where completions are derived from
partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing a novel tree-structured setting
for advantage estimation. This leads to a rich class of prefix-conditioned
reward signals, which we analyze theoretically and empirically. Our initial
results indicate that while structured advantage estimation can stabilize
updates and better reflect compositional reasoning quality, challenges such as
advantage saturation and reward signal collapse remain. We propose heuristic
and statistical solutions to mitigate these issues and discuss open challenges
for learning under staged or tree-like reward structures.

TL;DR: The paper studies certified explanations for tournament winners by identifying minimal sub-tournaments where a candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of other matches, providing abductive explanations for why winners win.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tournaments model pairwise dominance relationships, and there's a need for explainable AI approaches to provide certified explanations for why certain candidates emerge as winners under various tournament rules.

Method: The authors identify minimal supports (minimal sub-tournaments) where a candidate is a necessary winner, and develop polynomial-time algorithms to compute these minimal supports for various tournament solutions including top cycle, uncovered set, Copeland rule, Borda rule, and maximin rule.

Result: The research determines the size of smallest minimal supports for each tournament rule and presents efficient algorithms for computation, except for the weighted uncovered set where the problem is NP-complete.

Conclusion: Minimal supports provide compact, certified, and intuitive explanations for tournament winners, offering a formal explainable AI framework for understanding why candidates win under different tournament rules.

Abstract: Tournaments are widely used models to represent pairwise dominance between
candidates, alternatives, or teams. We study the problem of providing certified
explanations for why a candidate appears among the winners under various
tournament rules. To this end, we identify minimal supports, minimal
sub-tournaments in which the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how
the rest of the tournament is completed (that is, the candidate is a necessary
winner of the sub-tournament). This notion corresponds to an abductive
explanation for the question,"Why does the winner win the tournament", a
central concept in formal explainable AI. We focus on common tournament
solutions: the top cycle, the uncovered set, the Copeland rule, the Borda rule,
the maximin rule, and the weighted uncovered set. For each rule we determine
the size of the smallest minimal supports, and we present polynomial-time
algorithms to compute them for all but the weighted uncovered set, for which
the problem is NP-complete. Finally, we show how minimal supports can serve to
produce compact, certified, and intuitive explanations.

*Thuy Ngoc Nguyen,Anita Williams Woolley,Cleotilde Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study examines how spatial coordination dimensions (exploration diversity, movement specialization, adaptive spatial proximity) affect team performance in search and rescue tasks with restricted communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many teams (firefighters, military, emergency response) must coordinate physical movements without visual cues or extensive communication, but existing research focuses mainly on co-located or knowledge work coordination.

Method: Analyzed data from 34 four-person teams (136 participants) performing specialized roles in a collaborative online search and rescue task with restricted explicit communication, measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and movement alignment.

Result: Spatial specialization positively predicts performance, adaptive spatial proximity shows marginal inverted U-shaped relationship (moderate adaptation optimal), and temporal dynamics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over time.

Conclusion: Findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in role-based teamwork, highlighting importance of balanced adaptive strategies for training and AI-assisted team support systems.

Abstract: Coordinated teamwork is essential in fast-paced decision-making environments
that require dynamic adaptation, often without an opportunity for explicit
communication. Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered
in the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,
synchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily
on coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,
law enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in
physical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit
communication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial
coordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and
adaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative
online search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and
team members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and
coordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by
measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements
within shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136
participants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.
Results show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while
adaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,
suggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal
dynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over
time. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in
role-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive
strategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support
systems.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM-based ML agents are limited in task coverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing to capture their full capabilities in realistic settings.

Method: The benchmark uses browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition to collect ML challenges from platforms like Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata. It employs leaderboard-driven difficulty modeling and a multi-dimensional evaluation framework covering performance, format compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization.

Result: The authors constructed three benchmark subsets (Lite, Medium, Full) based on 150 curated AutoML tasks, with the Lite version containing 18 tasks balanced across modalities and difficulty levels for practical daily benchmarking.

Conclusion: TAM Bench provides a diverse, realistic, and structured evaluation framework for LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML tasks, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks through automated task collection, objective difficulty calibration, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of
general-purpose agents for automating end-to-end machine learning (ML)
workflows, including data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and
competition solving. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in task
coverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing
to capture the full capabilities of such agents in realistic settings. We
present TAM Bench, a diverse, realistic, and structured benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML tasks. TAM Bench features three
key innovations: (1) A browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition system
that automatically collects and structures ML challenges from platforms such as
Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata, spanning multiple task types and data modalities
(e.g., tabular, text, image, graph, audio); (2) A leaderboard-driven difficulty
modeling mechanism that estimates task complexity using participant counts and
score dispersion, enabling scalable and objective task calibration; (3) A
multi-dimensional evaluation framework incorporating performance, format
compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization. Based on 150 curated
AutoML tasks, we construct three benchmark subsets of different sizes -- Lite,
Medium, and Full -- designed for varying evaluation scenarios. The Lite
version, with 18 tasks and balanced coverage across modalities and difficulty
levels, serves as a practical testbed for daily benchmarking and comparative
studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL approaches struggle with balancing efficient exploration and semantic understanding due to limited cognitive capabilities, requiring human intervention for semantic tasks.

Method: Integration of Vision-Language Model common-sense through layered reward function, modeling VLM query as dedicated action, combined with curriculum learning strategy for robust learning.

Result: Significantly enhanced object discovery rates, learned capability to navigate towards semantically rich regions, and strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental information.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and scalable method for embedding common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, enabling fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in robotics.

Abstract: Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously
demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents.
Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive
abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more
informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL
approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding
due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the
agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration.
In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for
resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is
the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered
reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the
agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining
external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined
with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different
levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental
evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves
significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability
to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also
shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental
information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding
common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides
a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in
robotics.

Motivation: Existing few-shot prompting approaches limit LLM reasoning capabilities and require costly manual example construction, causing inconsistencies across tasks.

Method: Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO) elicits models' internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses without manually crafted examples.

Result: Experimental results show TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLM benchmarks while producing reasonable rationales.

Conclusion: TORSO provides an effective alternative to few-shot prompting that better utilizes LLMs' inherent reasoning capabilities across various tasks.

Abstract: The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human
reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for
enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby
achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using
few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples,
limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities.
Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may
lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce
Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize
internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks
without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental
results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs
benchmarks with reasonable rationales.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEDM is a self-evolving distributed memory framework that addresses noise accumulation, uncontrolled expansion, and limited generalization in multi-agent systems by integrating verifiable write admission, dynamic memory ranking, and cross-domain knowledge diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term multi-agent systems generate massive trajectories and interactions, requiring efficient memory management. Existing methods suffer from noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and poor cross-domain generalization.

Method: SEDM integrates three key components: verifiable write admission based on reproducible replay, self-scheduling memory controller for dynamic ranking and consolidation, and cross-domain knowledge diffusion for abstracting reusable insights.

Result: Evaluations show SEDM improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared to strong memory baselines, and enables knowledge transfer from fact verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning.

Conclusion: SEDM represents a scalable and sustainable memory mechanism that transforms memory from passive storage to an active, self-optimizing component for open-ended multi-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of
trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory
management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods
typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are
prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited
generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM,
Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that
transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing
component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible
replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and
consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge
diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across
heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM
improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong
memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact
verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a
scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent
collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.

TL;DR: Quantum models show promise for compositional generalization in vision-language tasks, outperforming classical tensor-based approaches with better training efficiency and achieving good results with multi-hot encodings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of compositional generalization in current AI tools like vision-language models, building on previous negative results with classical tensor-based semantics by leveraging quantum computing advantages.

Method: Used Variational Quantum Circuits to learn compositional tensor-based representations in Hilbert spaces for image captioning. Tested two encoding techniques: multi-hot encoding on binary image vectors and angle/amplitude encoding on CLIP image vectors.

Result: Achieved good proof-of-concept results with noisy multi-hot encodings. Performance with CLIP image vectors was mixed but still outperformed classical compositional models.

Conclusion: Quantum models demonstrate improved compositional generalization capabilities compared to classical approaches, showing particular promise with appropriate encoding techniques.

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a key facet of human cognition, but lacking
in current AI tools such as vision-language models. Previous work examined
whether a compositional tensor-based sentence semantics can overcome the
challenge, but led to negative results. We conjecture that the increased
training efficiency of quantum models will improve performance in these tasks.
We interpret the representations of compositional tensor-based models in
Hilbert spaces and train Variational Quantum Circuits to learn these
representations on an image captioning task requiring compositional
generalization. We used two image encoding techniques: a multi-hot encoding
(MHE) on binary image vectors and an angle/amplitude encoding on image vectors
taken from the vision-language model CLIP. We achieve good proof-of-concept
results using noisy MHE encodings. Performance on CLIP image vectors was more
mixed, but still outperformed classical compositional models.

Conclusion: Auras effectively overcomes the constraints of sequential computation in embodied AI systems, providing high and stable throughput while maintaining accuracy through its co-designed algorithm-system approach.

Abstract: Embodied AI systems operate in dynamic environments, requiring seamless
integration of perception and generation modules to process high-frequency
input and output demands. Traditional sequential computation patterns, while
effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the
necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we
present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize
the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the
perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them
to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem
that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public
context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy

TL;DR: Larger LLMs show exponential improvements in long-horizon task completion despite diminishing single-step accuracy gains. Models suffer from self-conditioning errors where prior mistakes increase future error likelihood, but thinking models avoid this and handle longer tasks better.

Motivation: To understand why LLMs fail at simple tasks when made longer, despite their strong reasoning capabilities on complex problems, and to investigate the relationship between model scaling and long-horizon task performance.

Method: Isolate execution capability by providing explicit knowledge and plans for long-horizon tasks. Compare per-step accuracy degradation across model sizes, analyze self-conditioning effects, and benchmark frontier thinking models on single-turn task length execution.

Result: Larger models execute significantly more turns even when small models have 100% single-turn accuracy. Per-step accuracy degrades with more steps due to self-conditioning (models become more error-prone when context contains prior mistakes). Thinking models don't self-condition and can execute much longer tasks.

Conclusion: Scaling model size and sequential test-time compute provides massive benefits for long-horizon tasks. Focusing on execution capability helps reconcile why LLMs succeed at complex reasoning yet fail at simple lengthened tasks, highlighting the importance of execution over pure reasoning.

Abstract: Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing
returns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can
complete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact
that marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential
improvements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,
we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from
mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating
execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to
solve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute
significantly more turns even when small models have 100\% single-turn
accuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the
number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --
curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely
to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.
Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,
recent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer
tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on
the length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on
the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve
complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and
highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time
compute for long-horizon tasks.
