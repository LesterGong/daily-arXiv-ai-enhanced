This\nstudy aimed to develop an automated approach to measure SDM by using language\nmodelling and the conversational alignment (CA) score. A total of 157\nvideo-recorded patient-doctor conversations from a randomized multi-centre\ntrial evaluating SDM decision aids for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillations\nwere transcribed and segmented into 42,559 sentences. Context-response pairs\nand negative sampling were employed to train deep learning (DL) models and\nfine-tuned BERT models via the next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Each\ntop-performing model was used to calculate four types of CA scores. A\nrandom-effects analysis by clinician, adjusting for age, sex, race, and trial\narm, assessed the association between CA scores and SDM outcomes: the\nDecisional Conflict Scale (DCS) and the Observing Patient Involvement in\nDecision-Making 12 (OPTION12) scores. p-values were corrected for multiple\ncomparisons with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Among 157 patients (34% female,\nmean age 70 SD 10.8), clinicians on average spoke more words than patients\n(1911 vs 773). The DL model without the stylebook strategy achieved a recall@1\nof 0.227, while the fine-tuned BERTbase (110M) achieved the highest recall@1\nwith 0.640. The AbsMax (18.36 SE7.74 p=0.025) and Max CA (21.02 SE7.63 p=0.012)\nscores generated with the DL without stylebook were associated with OPTION12.\nThe Max CA score generated with the fine-tuned BERTbase (110M) was associated\nwith the DCS score (-27.61 SE12.63 p=0.037).

These methods use a\nlearned (flow) model to transport an initial standard Gaussian noise that\nignores the condition to the conditional data distribution. The model is hence\nrequired to learn both mass transport and conditional injection. To ease the\ndemand on the model, we propose Condition-Aware Reparameterization for Flow\nMatching (CAR-Flow) -- a lightweight, learned shift that conditions the source,\nthe target, or both distributions. By relocating these distributions, CAR-Flow\nshortens the probability path the model must learn, leading to faster training\nin practice. On low-dimensional synthetic data, we visualize and quantify the\neffects of CAR. On higher-dimensional natural image data (ImageNet-256),\nequipping SiT-XL/2 with CAR-Flow reduces FID from 2.07 to 1.68, while\nintroducing less than 0.6% additional parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAR-Flow is a lightweight method that improves conditional generative modeling by reparameterizing source and target distributions to shorten probability paths, reducing model complexity while maintaining performance.", "motivation": "Current diffusion and flow-based methods require models to learn both mass transport and conditional injection simultaneously, which is demanding.
