### [1] [Proximity-Based Evidence Retrieval for Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13338)
*Hassan Gharoun,Mohammad Sadegh Khorshidi,Kasra Ranjbarigderi,Fang Chen,Amir H. Gandomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that uses instance-adaptive thresholds based on retrieved exemplars' predictive distributions fused via Dempster-Shafer theory, providing more reliable and interpretable uncertainty estimation than fixed entropy thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more reliable and transparent uncertainty-aware decision-making system that avoids the limitations of single global cutoff thresholds (like prediction entropy) which can lead to confidently incorrect outcomes and lack interpretability.

Method: For each test instance, retrieve proximal exemplars in embedding space, fuse their predictive distributions using Dempster-Shafer theory, and use the resulting fused belief as a per-instance adaptive thresholding mechanism.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with significantly fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and sustainable review load compared to entropy thresholding. Only a few evidences are needed for substantial gains.

Conclusion: Evidence-conditioned tagging provides a more reliable and interpretable alternative to fixed prediction entropy thresholds for operational uncertainty-aware decision-making, with explicit supporting evidence making decisions transparent and auditable.

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware
decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an
evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance,
proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive
distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief
acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences
are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on
CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable
uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect
outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on
prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize
these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These
results indicate that evidence-conditioned tagging provides a more reliable and
interpretable alternative to fixed prediction entropy thresholds for
operational uncertainty-aware decision-making.

### [2] [Hybrid Quantum-Classical Model for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13353)
*Muhammad Adnan Shahzad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid quantum-classical neural networks outperform classical CNNs in accuracy, training speed, and efficiency across MNIST, CIFAR100, and STL10 datasets, with advantages scaling with dataset complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically compare hybrid quantum-classical neural networks with purely classical models to evaluate performance, efficiency, and robustness across different benchmark datasets.

Method: Integrated parameterized quantum circuits with classical deep learning architectures and compared against conventional CNNs over 50 training epochs on MNIST, CIFAR100, and STL10 datasets, evaluating validation accuracy, test accuracy, training time, computational resources, and adversarial robustness.

Result: Hybrid models achieved higher accuracy (99.38% vs 98.21% on MNIST, 41.69% vs 32.25% on CIFAR100, 74.05% vs 63.76% on STL10), trained 5-12x faster, used 6-32% fewer parameters, consumed less memory (4-5GB vs 5-6GB), and showed better adversarial robustness on simpler datasets.

Conclusion: Hybrid quantum-classical architectures offer significant advantages in accuracy, training efficiency, and parameter scalability, particularly for complex vision tasks, though adversarial robustness advantages diminish with dataset complexity.

Abstract: This study presents a systematic comparison between hybrid quantum-classical
neural networks and purely classical models across three benchmark datasets
(MNIST, CIFAR100, and STL10) to evaluate their performance, efficiency, and
robustness. The hybrid models integrate parameterized quantum circuits with
classical deep learning architectures, while the classical counterparts use
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Experiments were conducted
over 50 training epochs for each dataset, with evaluations on validation
accuracy, test accuracy, training time, computational resource usage, and
adversarial robustness (tested with $\epsilon=0.1$ perturbations).Key findings
demonstrate that hybrid models consistently outperform classical models in
final accuracy, achieving {99.38\% (MNIST), 41.69\% (CIFAR100), and 74.05\%
(STL10) validation accuracy, compared to classical benchmarks of 98.21\%,
32.25\%, and 63.76\%, respectively. Notably, the hybrid advantage scales with
dataset complexity, showing the most significant gains on CIFAR100 (+9.44\%)
and STL10 (+10.29\%). Hybrid models also train 5--12$\times$ faster (e.g.,
21.23s vs. 108.44s per epoch on MNIST) and use 6--32\% fewer parameters} while
maintaining superior generalization to unseen test data.Adversarial robustness
tests reveal that hybrid models are significantly more resilient on simpler
datasets (e.g., 45.27\% robust accuracy on MNIST vs. 10.80\% for classical) but
show comparable fragility on complex datasets like CIFAR100 ($\sim$1\%
robustness for both). Resource efficiency analyses indicate that hybrid models
consume less memory (4--5GB vs. 5--6GB for classical) and lower CPU utilization
(9.5\% vs. 23.2\% on average).These results suggest that hybrid
quantum-classical architectures offer compelling advantages in accuracy,
training efficiency, and parameter scalability, particularly for complex vision
tasks.

### [3] [Research on Expressway Congestion Warning Technology Based on YOLOv11-DIoU and GRU-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13361)
*Tong Yulin,Liang Xuechen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An integrated framework for expressway traffic congestion management that improves vehicle detection accuracy under occlusion and enhances congestion prediction using optimized YOLOv11-DIoU, improved DeepSort, and a GRU-Attention model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expressway traffic congestion reduces travel efficiency and regional connectivity. Existing systems have low vehicle perception accuracy under occlusion and lose long-sequence dependencies in congestion forecasting.

Method: Optimized YOLOv11 with DIoU Loss for better detection, improved DeepSort with fused Mahalanobis and cosine distances, used Greenberg model for traffic flow analysis, and built GRU-Attention model for congestion prediction.

Result: YOLOv11-DIoU achieved 95.7% mAP (6.5% higher than baseline) with 5.3% occlusion miss rate. DeepSort reached 93.8% MOTA. GRU-Attention achieved 99.7% test accuracy with ≤1 minute time error in 10-minute advance warnings for 30-minute congestion.

Conclusion: The framework provides quantitative support for expressway congestion control with promising applications in intelligent transportation systems, demonstrating high accuracy and stable performance in high-flow scenarios.

Abstract: Expressway traffic congestion severely reduces travel efficiency and hinders
regional connectivity. Existing "detection-prediction" systems have critical
flaws: low vehicle perception accuracy under occlusion and loss of
long-sequence dependencies in congestion forecasting. This study proposes an
integrated technical framework to resolve these issues.For traffic flow
perception, two baseline algorithms were optimized. Traditional YOLOv11 was
upgraded to YOLOv11-DIoU by replacing GIoU Loss with DIoU Loss, and DeepSort
was improved by fusing Mahalanobis (motion) and cosine (appearance) distances.
Experiments on Chang-Shen Expressway videos showed YOLOv11-DIoU achieved 95.7\%
mAP (6.5 percentage points higher than baseline) with 5.3\% occlusion miss
rate. DeepSort reached 93.8\% MOTA (11.3 percentage points higher than SORT)
with only 4 ID switches. Using the Greenberg model (for 10-15 vehicles/km
high-density scenarios), speed and density showed a strong negative correlation
(r=-0.97), conforming to traffic flow theory. For congestion warning, a
GRU-Attention model was built to capture congestion precursors. Trained 300
epochs with flow, density, and speed, it achieved 99.7\% test accuracy (7-9
percentage points higher than traditional GRU). In 10-minute advance warnings
for 30-minute congestion, time error was $\leq$ 1 minute. Validation with an
independent video showed 95\% warning accuracy, over 90\% spatial overlap of
congestion points, and stable performance in high-flow ($>$5 vehicles/second)
scenarios.This framework provides quantitative support for expressway
congestion control, with promising intelligent transportation applications.

*Yuxiao Lee,Xiaofeng Cao,Wei Ye,Jiangchao Yao,Jingkuan Song,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper systematically analyzes CLIP-based vision-language models for zero-shot out-of-distribution detection, revealing their mechanisms, advantages over single-modal methods, and critical sensitivity to prompt phrasing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite VLMs demonstrating remarkable zero-shot OOD detection capabilities, there's incomplete understanding of why they work effectively, their advantages over single-modal methods, and their behavioral robustness.

Method: Systematic empirical analysis using in-distribution and OOD prompts to characterize VLM embedding space properties, quantify superiority over single-modal approaches, and evaluate sensitivity to image noise and prompt phrasing.

Result: VLMs leverage rich semantic novelty for superior OOD detection, show resilience to image noise but are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, revealing a significant asymmetry in robustness.

Conclusion: The findings provide structured understanding of VLM strengths and vulnerabilities, offering empirically-grounded guidance for developing more robust and reliable OOD detection systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection capabilities, vital for reliable
AI systems. Despite this promising capability, a comprehensive understanding of
(1) why they work so effectively, (2) what advantages do they have over
single-modal methods, and (3) how is their behavioral robustness -- remains
notably incomplete within the research community. This paper presents a
systematic empirical analysis of VLM-based OOD detection using in-distribution
(ID) and OOD prompts. (1) Mechanisms: We systematically characterize and
formalize key operational properties within the VLM embedding space that
facilitate zero-shot OOD detection. (2) Advantages: We empirically quantify the
superiority of these models over established single-modal approaches,
attributing this distinct advantage to the VLM's capacity to leverage rich
semantic novelty. (3) Sensitivity: We uncovers a significant and previously
under-explored asymmetry in their robustness profile: while exhibiting
resilience to common image noise, these VLM-based methods are highly sensitive
to prompt phrasing. Our findings contribute a more structured understanding of
the strengths and critical vulnerabilities inherent in VLM-based OOD detection,
offering crucial, empirically-grounded guidance for developing more robust and
reliable future designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a quantitative measure for assessing the quality of data representations from dimensionality reduction techniques and to understand the large-scale geometry of empirical networks.

Method: Utilizes abstract notions of sectional curvature that capture metric relations between triples of points and other points to construct curvature-based geometric profiles of discrete metric spaces.

Result: The curvature-based analysis can effectively evaluate dimensionality reduction techniques and estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed curvature profile provides a powerful tool for geometric analysis of discrete metric spaces and quantitative assessment of data representation quality.

Abstract: Utilizing recently developed abstract notions of sectional curvature, we
introduce a method for constructing a curvature-based geometric profile of
discrete metric spaces. The curvature concept that we use here captures the
metric relations between triples of points and other points. More
significantly, based on this curvature profile, we introduce a quantitative
measure to evaluate the effectiveness of data representations, such as those
produced by dimensionality reduction techniques. Furthermore, Our experiments
demonstrate that this curvature-based analysis can be employed to estimate the
intrinsic dimensionality of datasets. We use this to explore the large-scale
geometry of empirical networks and to evaluate the effectiveness of
dimensionality reduction techniques.

IoU tracker that ensures resilient multi-object tracking under occlusion and
motion. To enable scalable field deployment, the pipeline is optimized for
deployment on low-cost edge hardware using mixed-precision inference. The
system supports incremental updates by adding embeddings from previously unseen
objects into a reference database without requiring model retraining. Extensive
experiments on real-world surveillance and drone video datasets demonstrate the
framework's high accuracy and robustness across diverse FOI scenarios. In
addition, hardware benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson devices confirm the framework's

### [9] [EdiVal-Agent: An Object-Centric Framework for Automated, Scalable, Fine-Grained Evaluation of Multi-Turn Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13399)
*Tianyu Chen,Yasi Zhang,Zhi Zhang,Peiyu Yu,Shu Wang,Zhendong Wang,Kevin Lin,Xiaofei Wang,Zhengyuan Yang,Linjie Li,Chung-Ching Lin,Jianwen Xie,Oscar Leong,Lijuan Wang,Ying Nian Wu,Mingyuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdiVal-Agent is an automated evaluation framework for instruction-based image editing that combines VLMs with object detectors for better alignment with human judgments, addressing limitations of current evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation protocols for instruction-based image editing either rely on limited paired reference images or imprecise zero-shot VLMs, creating a bottleneck for reliable and interpretable assessment.

Method: The framework first decomposes images into semantic objects, synthesizes diverse editing instructions, then integrates VLMs with object detectors for instruction following assessment, semantic feature extractors for content consistency, and human preference models for visual quality.

Result: Combining VLMs with object detectors shows stronger agreement with human judgments compared to using VLMs alone or CLIP-based metrics. The framework successfully evaluates 11 state-of-the-art editing models across 9 instruction types.

Conclusion: EdiVal-Agent provides a scalable, fine-grained evaluation approach that can identify failure modes in current editing models and inform future development, with a modular design allowing for continuous improvement through tool integration.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has advanced rapidly, yet reliable and
interpretable evaluation remains a bottleneck. Current protocols either (i)
depend on paired reference images -- resulting in limited coverage and
inheriting biases from prior generative models -- or (ii) rely solely on
zero-shot vision-language models (VLMs), whose prompt-based assessments of
instruction following, content consistency, and visual quality are often
imprecise.
  To address this, we introduce EdiVal-Agent, an automated, scalable, and
fine-grained evaluation framework for multi-turn instruction-based editing from
an object-centric perspective, supported by a suite of expert tools. Given an
image, EdiVal-Agent first decomposes it into semantically meaningful objects,
then synthesizes diverse, context-aware editing instructions. For evaluation,
it integrates VLMs with open-vocabulary object detectors to assess instruction
following, uses semantic-level feature extractors to evaluate content
consistency, and leverages human preference models to judge visual quality. We
show that combining VLMs with object detectors yields stronger agreement with
human judgments in instruction-following evaluation compared to using VLMs
alone and CLIP-based metrics. Furthermore, the pipeline's modular design allows
future tools to be seamlessly integrated, enhancing evaluation accuracy over
time.
  Instantiating this pipeline, we build EdiVal-Bench, a multi-turn editing
benchmark covering 9 instruction types and 11 state-of-the-art editing models
spanning autoregressive (AR) (including Nano Banana, GPT-Image-1),
flow-matching, and diffusion paradigms. We demonstrate that EdiVal-Agent can be
used to identify existing failure modes, thereby informing the development of
the next generation of editing models. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapAnything is a unified transformer-based model that takes images and optional geometric inputs to directly predict metric 3D scene geometry and cameras in a single feed-forward pass, outperforming specialized models across multiple 3D vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a universal 3D reconstruction backbone that can handle diverse 3D vision tasks without task-specific architectures, addressing the need for a unified approach to 3D scene understanding.

Method: Uses a transformer-based feed-forward model with factored representation of multi-view geometry (depth maps, local ray maps, camera poses, metric scale factor). Standardizes supervision across datasets and employs flexible input augmentation.

Result: Outperforms or matches specialist feed-forward models across various tasks including structure-from-motion, multi-view stereo, monocular depth estimation, camera localization, and depth completion.

Conclusion: MapAnything demonstrates efficient joint training and serves as a universal 3D reconstruction backbone, paving the way for unified 3D vision systems.

Abstract: We introduce MapAnything, a unified transformer-based feed-forward model that
ingests one or more images along with optional geometric inputs such as camera
intrinsics, poses, depth, or partial reconstructions, and then directly
regresses the metric 3D scene geometry and cameras. MapAnything leverages a
factored representation of multi-view scene geometry, i.e., a collection of
depth maps, local ray maps, camera poses, and a metric scale factor that
effectively upgrades local reconstructions into a globally consistent metric
frame. Standardizing the supervision and training across diverse datasets,
along with flexible input augmentation, enables MapAnything to address a broad
range of 3D vision tasks in a single feed-forward pass, including uncalibrated
structure-from-motion, calibrated multi-view stereo, monocular depth
estimation, camera localization, depth completion, and more. We provide
extensive experimental analyses and model ablations demonstrating that
MapAnything outperforms or matches specialist feed-forward models while
offering more efficient joint training behavior, thus paving the way toward a
universal 3D reconstruction backbone.

*Yujia Lin,Nicholas Evans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCM-PR is a semantic-enhanced cross-modal place recognition framework that combines RGB images and LiDAR maps with semantic information to achieve robust robot localization in GPS-denied environments, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-based VPR methods are sensitive to illumination, weather, and seasonal changes, while current cross-modal methods struggle with complex scenes, fine-grained matching, and viewpoint changes.

Method: Uses VMamba backbone for RGB feature extraction, Semantic-Aware Feature Fusion module, LiDAR descriptors with semantics and geometry, cross-modal semantic attention in NetVLAD, Multi-View Semantic-Geometric Matching, and Semantic Consistency Loss in contrastive learning framework.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets compared to other cross-modal place recognition methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating semantic information significantly improves cross-modal place recognition robustness and performance in challenging environmental conditions.

Abstract: Ensuring accurate localization of robots in environments without GPS
capability is a challenging task. Visual Place Recognition (VPR) techniques can
potentially achieve this goal, but existing RGB-based methods are sensitive to
changes in illumination, weather, and other seasonal changes. Existing
cross-modal localization methods leverage the geometric properties of RGB
images and 3D LiDAR maps to reduce the sensitivity issues highlighted above.
Currently, state-of-the-art methods struggle in complex scenes, fine-grained or
high-resolution matching, and situations where changes can occur in viewpoint.
In this work, we introduce a framework we call Semantic-Enhanced Cross-Modal
Place Recognition (SCM-PR) that combines high-level semantics utilizing RGB
images for robust localization in LiDAR maps. Our proposed method introduces: a
VMamba backbone for feature extraction of RGB images; a Semantic-Aware Feature
Fusion (SAFF) module for using both place descriptors and segmentation masks;
LiDAR descriptors that incorporate both semantics and geometry; and a
cross-modal semantic attention mechanism in NetVLAD to improve matching.
Incorporating the semantic information also was instrumental in designing a
Multi-View Semantic-Geometric Matching and a Semantic Consistency Loss, both in
a contrastive learning framework. Our experimental work on the KITTI and
KITTI-360 datasets show that SCM-PR achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to other cross-modal place recognition methods.

### [12] [Improving 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression by Scene-Adaptive Lattice Vector Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13482)
*Hao Xu,Xiaolin Wu,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Replacing uniform scalar quantization with scene-adaptive lattice vector quantization (SALVQ) improves 3D Gaussian Splatting compression efficiency with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS generates massive data requiring compression, but current methods use simple uniform quantization. More sophisticated quantizers could improve compression with little extra cost.

Method: Propose scene-adaptive lattice vector quantization (SALVQ) that optimizes lattice basis per scene and allows dynamic bit rate adjustment through lattice scaling.

Result: SALVQ enhances R-D performance of existing 3DGS compression methods with minimal modifications and computational overhead.

Conclusion: SALVQ provides better compression efficiency than uniform quantization while maintaining low complexity, enabling single-model multi-rate compression without separate training.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is rapidly gaining popularity for its
photorealistic rendering quality and real-time performance, but it generates
massive amounts of data. Hence compressing 3DGS data is necessary for the cost
effectiveness of 3DGS models. Recently, several anchor-based neural compression
methods have been proposed, achieving good 3DGS compression performance.
However, they all rely on uniform scalar quantization (USQ) due to its
simplicity. A tantalizing question is whether more sophisticated quantizers can
improve the current 3DGS compression methods with very little extra overhead
and minimal change to the system. The answer is yes by replacing USQ with
lattice vector quantization (LVQ). To better capture scene-specific
characteristics, we optimize the lattice basis for each scene, improving LVQ's
adaptability and R-D efficiency. This scene-adaptive LVQ (SALVQ) strikes a
balance between the R-D efficiency of vector quantization and the low
complexity of USQ. SALVQ can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS
compression architectures, enhancing their R-D performance with minimal
modifications and computational overhead. Moreover, by scaling the lattice
basis vectors, SALVQ can dynamically adjust lattice density, enabling a single
model to accommodate multiple bit rate targets. This flexibility eliminates the
need to train separate models for different compression levels, significantly
reducing training time and memory consumption.

*Liu Liu,Alexandra Kudaeva,Marco Cipriano,Fatimeh Al Ghannam,Freya Tan,Gerard de Melo,Andres Sevtsuk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MINGLE is a three-stage pipeline for detecting social group regions in urban images by combining human detection, VLM-based social affiliation classification, and spatial aggregation, supported by a new 100K image dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding group-level social interactions is crucial for urban planning to create socially vibrant environments, but detecting these interactions requires interpreting complex visual cues beyond traditional object detection.

Method: A modular three-stage pipeline: (1) off-the-shelf human detection and depth estimation, (2) VLM-based reasoning to classify pairwise social affiliation, (3) lightweight spatial aggregation algorithm to localize socially connected groups.

Result: Developed a new dataset of 100K urban street-view images with bounding boxes and labels for individuals and social groups, combining human annotations and MINGLE outputs for semantic richness and broad coverage.

Conclusion: MINGLE provides an effective approach for detecting social group regions from images, enabling better understanding of social interactions in public spaces for urban planning applications.

Abstract: Understanding group-level social interactions in public spaces is crucial for
urban planning, informing the design of socially vibrant and inclusive
environments. Detecting such interactions from images involves interpreting
subtle visual cues such as relations, proximity, and co-movement - semantically
complex signals that go beyond traditional object detection. To address this
challenge, we introduce a social group region detection task, which requires
inferring and spatially grounding visual regions defined by abstract
interpersonal relations. We propose MINGLE (Modeling INterpersonal Group-Level
Engagement), a modular three-stage pipeline that integrates: (1) off-the-shelf
human detection and depth estimation, (2) VLM-based reasoning to classify
pairwise social affiliation, and (3) a lightweight spatial aggregation
algorithm to localize socially connected groups. To support this task and
encourage future research, we present a new dataset of 100K urban street-view
images annotated with bounding boxes and labels for both individuals and
socially interacting groups. The annotations combine human-created labels and
outputs from the MINGLE pipeline, ensuring semantic richness and broad coverage
of real-world scenarios.

*Rajatsubhra Chakraborty,Xujun Che,Depeng Xu,Cori Faklaris,Xi Niu,Shuhan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiasMap is a framework that discovers latent concept-level biases in text-to-image models using cross-attention attribution maps and quantifies demographic-semantic entanglement via IoU, then mitigates bias through energy-guided diffusion sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias discovery methods focus on output-level demographic distributions but fail to uncover deeper representational biases and concept entanglements in stable diffusion models, leaving hidden biases unaddressed.

Method: Leverages cross-attention attribution maps to reveal structural entanglements between demographics and semantics, quantifies spatial concept entanglement using Intersection over Union (IoU), and implements bias mitigation through energy-guided diffusion sampling that modifies latent noise space to minimize expected SoftIoU during denoising.

Result: Shows that existing fairness interventions reduce output distribution gaps but fail to disentangle concept-level coupling, while BiasMap successfully mitigates concept entanglement in image generation and complements distributional bias mitigation.

Conclusion: BiasMap provides a deeper lens into hidden representational biases in text-to-image models and offers an effective mitigation approach that addresses both concept-level entanglement and distributional biases, going beyond surface-level fairness metrics.

Abstract: Bias discovery is critical for black-box generative models, especiall
text-to-image (TTI) models. Existing works predominantly focus on output-level
demographic distributions, which do not necessarily guarantee concept
representations to be disentangled post-mitigation. We propose BiasMap, a
model-agnostic framework for uncovering latent concept-level representational
biases in stable diffusion models. BiasMap leverages cross-attention
attribution maps to reveal structural entanglements between demographics (e.g.,
gender, race) and semantics (e.g., professions), going deeper into
representational bias during the image generation. Using attribution maps of
these concepts, we quantify the spatial demographics-semantics concept
entanglement via Intersection over Union (IoU), offering a lens into bias that
remains hidden in existing fairness discovery approaches. In addition, we
further utilize BiasMap for bias mitigation through energy-guided diffusion
sampling that directly modifies latent noise space and minimizes the expected
SoftIoU during the denoising process. Our findings show that existing fairness
interventions may reduce the output distributional gap but often fail to
disentangle concept-level coupling, whereas our mitigation method can mitigate
concept entanglement in image generation while complementing distributional
bias mitigation.

*Uriel Garcilazo-Cruz,Joseph O. Okeme,Rodrigo A. Vargas--Hernández*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LivePyxel is a Python-based GUI tool for real-time image annotation that integrates directly with imaging systems like microscopes and webcams, eliminating the need for pre-collected datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image annotation tools require uploading pre-collected datasets, which limits real-time data acquisition from laboratory instruments and introduces unnecessary workflow steps.

Method: Developed a Python-based graphical interface with OpenCV integration that supports real-time annotation using Bézier splines, binary masks, and non-destructive layers, compatible with various video devices.

Result: Created LivePyxel software that enables seamless real-time data collection and labeling directly from imaging systems, optimized for object detection operations with high-performance matrix handling.

Conclusion: LivePyxel accelerates AI model development in experimental workflows by providing flexible, real-time annotation capabilities that integrate directly with laboratory imaging instruments.

Abstract: The lack of flexible annotation tools has hindered the deployment of AI
models in some scientific areas. Most existing image annotation software
requires users to upload a precollected dataset, which limits support for
on-demand pipelines and introduces unnecessary steps to acquire images. This
constraint is particularly problematic in laboratory environments, where
real-time data acquisition from instruments such as microscopes is increasingly
common. In this work, we introduce \texttt{LivePixel}, a Python-based graphical
user interface that integrates with imaging systems, such as webcams,
microscopes, and others, to enable real-time image annotation. LivePyxel is
designed to be easy to use through a simple interface that allows users to
precisely delimit areas for annotation using tools commonly found in commercial
graphics editing software. Of particular interest is the availability of
B\'ezier splines and binary masks, and the software's capacity to work with
non-destructive layers that enable high-performance editing. LivePyxel also
integrates a wide compatibility across video devices, and it's optimized for
object detection operations via the use of OpenCV in combination with
high-performance libraries designed to handle matrix and linear algebra
operations via Numpy effectively. LivePyxel facilitates seamless data
collection and labeling, accelerating the development of AI models in
experimental workflows. LivePyxel freely available at

*Xingzi Xu,Qi Li,Shuwen Qiu,Julien Han,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEFT-VTON applies Doob's h-transform efficient fine-tuning to adapt pre-trained diffusion models for virtual try-on, using only 1.42% of parameters and achieving SOTA performance with just 15 denoising steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world VTO applications require limited training/inference budgets, but current methods involve extensive end-to-end training of large pre-trained models.

Method: Freezes pre-trained model parameters and trains small h-transform network for conditional generation. Adds adaptive consistency loss to combine consistency training with denoising score matching for faster inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on VTO tasks with only 15 denoising steps while maintaining competitive results.

Conclusion: DEFT-VTON provides an efficient fine-tuning approach that significantly reduces parameter requirements and inference time while maintaining high performance for virtual try-on applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models enable high-quality virtual try-on (VTO) with their
established image synthesis abilities. Despite the extensive end-to-end
training of large pre-trained models involved in current VTO methods,
real-world applications often prioritize limited training and inference,
serving, and deployment budgets for VTO. To solve this obstacle, we apply
Doob's h-transform efficient fine-tuning (DEFT) for adapting large pre-trained
unconditional models for downstream image-conditioned VTO abilities. DEFT
freezes the pre-trained model's parameters and trains a small h-transform
network to learn a conditional h-transform. The h-transform network allows
training only 1.42 percent of the frozen parameters, compared to a baseline of
5.52 percent in traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).
  To further improve DEFT's performance and decrease existing models' inference
time, we additionally propose an adaptive consistency loss. Consistency
training distills slow but high-performing diffusion models into a fast one
while retaining performance by enforcing consistencies along the inference
path. Inspired by constrained optimization, instead of distillation, we combine
the consistency loss and the denoising score matching loss in a data-adaptive
manner for fine-tuning existing VTO models at a low cost. Empirical results
show the proposed DEFT-VTON method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VTO
tasks, with as few as 15 denoising steps, while maintaining competitive
results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FunKAN is a novel interpretable neural network that extends Kolmogorov-Arnold networks to functional spaces using Fourier decomposition with Hermite functions, achieving state-of-the-art performance in medical image enhancement and segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning approaches for medical image processing lack interpretability, and existing Kolmogorov-Arnold networks disrupt spatial structure by flattening image features, limiting their effectiveness for medical imaging tasks.

Method: Proposed Functional Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (FunKAN) that generalizes the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem to functional spaces, learning inner functions via Fourier decomposition over Hermite basis functions. Also developed U-FunKAN for segmentation tasks.

Result: Outperformed other KAN-based methods in medical image enhancement (PSNR, TV metrics on IXI dataset) and segmentation (IoU, F1 scores on BUSI, GlaS, and CVC-ClinicDB datasets for breast cancer, glands, and polyps detection respectively).

Conclusion: FunKAN successfully bridges theoretical function approximation with medical image analysis, providing an interpretable and robust solution that preserves spatial structure while achieving superior performance in clinical applications.

Abstract: Medical image enhancement and segmentation are critical yet challenging tasks
in modern clinical practice, constrained by artifacts and complex anatomical
variations. Traditional deep learning approaches often rely on complex
architectures with limited interpretability. While Kolmogorov-Arnold networks
offer interpretable solutions, their reliance on flattened feature
representations fundamentally disrupts the intrinsic spatial structure of
imaging data. To address this issue we propose a Functional Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network (FunKAN) -- a novel interpretable neural framework, designed
specifically for image processing, that formally generalizes the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem onto functional spaces and learns
inner functions using Fourier decomposition over the basis Hermite functions.
We explore FunKAN on several medical image processing tasks, including Gibbs
ringing suppression in magnetic resonance images, benchmarking on IXI dataset.
We also propose U-FunKAN as state-of-the-art binary medical segmentation model
with benchmarks on three medical datasets: BUSI (ultrasound images), GlaS
(histological structures) and CVC-ClinicDB (colonoscopy videos), detecting
breast cancer, glands and polyps, respectively. Experiments on those diverse
datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms other KAN-based backbones in
both medical image enhancement (PSNR, TV) and segmentation (IoU, F1). Our work
bridges the gap between theoretical function approximation and medical image
analysis, offering a robust, interpretable solution for clinical applications.

TL;DR: A novel multimodal dual-stream graph neural network model that separates videos into instances, assigns importance weights to highlight hateful content, and achieves state-of-the-art hateful video classification with strong explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal hateful video detection methods treat all content uniformly instead of emphasizing hateful components, and cannot systematically capture structured information in videos, limiting multimodal fusion effectiveness.

Method: Proposes a dual-stream GNN that constructs instance graphs to extract instance-level features, then uses a complementary weight graph to assign importance weights highlighting hateful instances. Combines weights and features for classification using graph-based framework to model structured relationships across modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on public datasets show the model achieves state-of-the-art performance in hateful video classification and demonstrates strong explainability.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal dual-stream GNN effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by focusing on hateful instances and systematically capturing structured video information, resulting in superior classification performance and explainable results.

Abstract: Hateful videos present serious risks to online safety and real-world
well-being, necessitating effective detection methods. Although multimodal
classification approaches integrating information from several modalities
outperform unimodal ones, they typically neglect that even minimal hateful
content defines a video's category. Specifically, they generally treat all
content uniformly, instead of emphasizing the hateful components. Additionally,
existing multimodal methods cannot systematically capture structured
information in videos, limiting the effectiveness of multimodal fusion. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal dual-stream graph
neural network model. It constructs an instance graph by separating the given
video into several instances to extract instance-level features. Then, a
complementary weight graph assigns importance weights to these features,
highlighting hateful instances. Importance weights and instance features are
combined to generate video labels. Our model employs a graph-based framework to
systematically model structured relationships within and across modalities.
Extensive experiments on public datasets show that our model is
state-of-the-art in hateful video classification and has strong explainability.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) scene understanding in colonoscopy presents
significant challenges that necessitate automated methods for accurate depth
estimation. However, existing depth estimation models for endoscopy struggle
with temporal consistency across video sequences, limiting their applicability
for 3D reconstruction. We present ColonCrafter, a diffusion-based depth
estimation model that generates temporally consistent depth maps from monocular

TL;DR: This paper proposes methods to reduce GPU memory usage and improve rendering quality for 3D Gaussian Splatting on resource-constrained embedded platforms like micro air vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS research focuses on high-performance desktop GPUs, overlooking embedded platforms with limited computational resources and memory. There's a need to address the trade-off between system performance and reconstruction quality for devices like micro air vehicles.

Method: Two main approaches: 1) Merging redundant 3D Gaussian primitives in voxel space based on geometric similarity to reduce GPU memory usage, and 2) Initializing 3D Gaussian primitives via Patch-Grid point sampling for more accurate scene modeling and improved rendering quality.

Result: The proposed methods achieve reduced GPU memory usage without impacting system runtime performance while simultaneously enhancing rendering quality, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations on publicly available datasets.

Conclusion: The paper presents effective improvements to 3D Gaussian Splatting that make it more suitable for embedded platforms by addressing both memory efficiency and rendering quality challenges.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have made a significant
impact on rendering and reconstruction techniques. Current research
predominantly focuses on improving rendering performance and reconstruction
quality using high-performance desktop GPUs, largely overlooking applications
for embedded platforms like micro air vehicles (MAVs). These devices, with
their limited computational resources and memory, often face a trade-off
between system performance and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we
improve existing methods in terms of GPU memory usage while enhancing rendering
quality. Specifically, to address redundant 3D Gaussian primitives in SLAM, we
propose merging them in voxel space based on geometric similarity. This reduces
GPU memory usage without impacting system runtime performance. Furthermore,
rendering quality is improved by initializing 3D Gaussian primitives via
Patch-Grid (PG) point sampling, enabling more accurate modeling of the entire
scene. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on publicly available datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our improvements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive framework for trajectory-level out-of-distribution detection in autonomous vehicles that models prediction error modes to improve detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trajectory prediction models face distribution shifts in real-world deployment, with rare scenarios causing OOD cases. While most OOD detection research focuses on computer vision tasks, trajectory-level detection remains underexplored.

Method: Builds on quickest change detection formulation and introduces adaptive mechanisms to model mode-dependent prediction error distributions that evolve over time with dataset-specific dynamics.

Result: Achieves substantial improvements in both detection delay and false alarm rates. Significantly outperforms prior uncertainty quantification and vision-based OOD approaches in accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Provides a practical path toward reliable, driving-aware autonomy by offering robust trajectory-level OOD detection that adapts to complex driving environments.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is central to the safe and seamless operation of
autonomous vehicles (AVs). In deployment, however, prediction models inevitably
face distribution shifts between training data and real-world conditions, where
rare or underrepresented traffic scenarios induce out-of-distribution (OOD)
cases. While most prior OOD detection research in AVs has concentrated on
computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation,
trajectory-level OOD detection remains largely underexplored. A recent study
formulated this problem as a quickest change detection (QCD) task, providing
formal guarantees on the trade-off between detection delay and false alarms
[1]. Building on this foundation, we propose a new framework that introduces
adaptive mechanisms to achieve robust detection in complex driving
environments. Empirical analysis across multiple real-world datasets reveals
that prediction errors -- even on in-distribution samples -- exhibit
mode-dependent distributions that evolve over time with dataset-specific
dynamics. By explicitly modeling these error modes, our method achieves
substantial improvements in both detection delay and false alarm rates.
Comprehensive experiments on established trajectory prediction benchmarks show
that our framework significantly outperforms prior UQ- and vision-based OOD
approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical
path toward reliable, driving-aware autonomy.

TL;DR: CLAP is extended from 2D localization to a general framework for 3D localization and image stitching, showing relationships with RANSAC and Hough transforms for robust outlier handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the CLAP algorithm beyond 2D localization to handle 3D localization and image stitching problems while maintaining robustness against outliers and noise.

Method: Extends the clustering-based CLAP framework that uses clustering to suppress noise and mitigate erroneous feature matches, providing an alternative to traditional outlier rejection methods like RANSAC.

Result: Successfully generalized CLAP to 3D localization and image stitching applications, demonstrating its broader applicability across different fields for handling noise and uncertainty.

Conclusion: CLAP's generalization provides a versatile tool for various localization and stitching problems, offering robust performance against outliers and establishing connections with established methods like RANSAC and Hough transforms.

Abstract: In previous work, we introduced a 2D localization algorithm called CLAP,
Clustering to Localize Across $n$ Possibilities, which was used during our
championship win in RoboCup 2024, an international autonomous humanoid soccer
competition. CLAP is particularly recognized for its robustness against
outliers, where clustering is employed to suppress noise and mitigate against
erroneous feature matches. This clustering-based strategy provides an
alternative to traditional outlier rejection schemes such as RANSAC, in which
candidates are validated by reprojection error across all data points. In this
paper, CLAP is extended to a more general framework beyond 2D localization,
specifically to 3D localization and image stitching. We also show how CLAP,
RANSAC, and Hough transforms are related. The generalization of CLAP is widely
applicable to many different fields and can be a useful tool to deal with noise
and uncertainty.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMIR is a medical image registration framework that leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for enhanced feature extraction, achieving state-of-the-art performance on cardiac and abdominal CT registration tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional weakly supervised registration methods require anatomical priors like segmentation masks or landmarks, which are often unavailable in practice. The authors aim to leverage visual foundation models' representation learning capabilities to overcome this limitation.

Method: Uses SAM's pretrained image encoder to extract structure-aware feature embeddings, adds a lightweight 3D head to refine features for local deformations, and introduces a Hierarchical Feature Consistency Loss for coarse-to-fine feature matching.

Result: Achieves significant performance improvements: 2.68% on ACDC cardiac dataset and 6.44% on abdomen CT dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SAMIR demonstrates that leveraging visual foundation models like SAM can effectively enhance medical image registration without requiring additional weak labels, providing a practical and efficient solution for clinical applications.

Abstract: Image registration is a fundamental task in medical image analysis.
Deformations are often closely related to the morphological characteristics of
tissues, making accurate feature extraction crucial. Recent weakly supervised
methods improve registration by incorporating anatomical priors such as
segmentation masks or landmarks, either as inputs or in the loss function.
However, such weak labels are often not readily available, limiting their
practical use. Motivated by the strong representation learning ability of
visual foundation models, this paper introduces SAMIR, an efficient medical
image registration framework that utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to
enhance feature extraction. SAM is pretrained on large-scale natural image
datasets and can learn robust, general-purpose visual representations. Rather
than using raw input images, we design a task-specific adaptation pipeline
using SAM's image encoder to extract structure-aware feature embeddings,
enabling more accurate modeling of anatomical consistency and deformation
patterns. We further design a lightweight 3D head to refine features within the
embedding space, adapting to local deformations in medical images.
Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Feature Consistency Loss to guide
coarse-to-fine feature matching and improve anatomical alignment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SAMIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on benchmark datasets for both intra-subject cardiac image registration
and inter-subject abdomen CT image registration, achieving performance
improvements of 2.68% on ACDC and 6.44% on the abdomen dataset. The source code
will be publicly available on GitHub following the acceptance of this paper.

TL;DR: A distributed federated learning approach for deforestation detection using satellite imagery that preserves data privacy across multiple edge centers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate deforestation identification while maintaining data privacy and security across distributed satellite data centers, avoiding the need to centralize sensitive data.

Method: Uses Federated Learning with FLOWER and RAY frameworks, employing YOLOS-small (Vision Transformer), Faster R-CNN with ResNet50, and Faster R-CNN with MobileNetV3 models on satellite imagery datasets.

Result: Developed a privacy-preserving distributed framework that successfully identifies and locates deforestation across multiple clients without compromising data security.

Conclusion: Federated Learning provides an effective solution for satellite image segmentation tasks like deforestation detection while ensuring data privacy across distributed edge centers.

Abstract: Accurate identification of deforestation from satellite images is essential
in order to understand the geographical situation of an area. This paper
introduces a new distributed approach to identify as well as locate
deforestation across different clients using Federated Learning (FL). Federated
Learning enables distributed network clients to collaboratively train a model
while maintaining data privacy and security of the active users. In our
framework, a client corresponds to an edge satellite center responsible for
local data processing. Moreover, FL provides an advantage over centralized
training method which requires combining data, thereby compromising with data
security of the clients. Our framework leverages the FLOWER framework with RAY
framework to execute the distributed learning workload. Furthermore, efficient
client spawning is ensured by RAY as it can select definite amount of users to
create an emulation environment. Our FL framework uses YOLOS-small (a Vision
Transformer variant), Faster R-CNN with a ResNet50 backbone, and Faster R-CNN
with a MobileNetV3 backbone models trained and tested on publicly available
datasets. Our approach provides us a different view for image
segmentation-based tasks on satellite imagery.

*Yumin Li,Dylan Campbell*

TL;DR: GARPS is a training-free framework for metric relative camera pose estimation that aligns 3D Gaussian Mixture Models from two images using monocular depth estimation and Gaussian scene reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional two-view pose estimation methods are not metric (scale-ambiguous), struggle with wide baselines, and perform poorly on textureless or reflective surfaces.

Method: Uses metric monocular depth estimator and Gaussian scene reconstructor to create metric 3D GMMs for each image, then refines initial pose by optimizing a differentiable GMM alignment objective considering geometry, color, covariance, and semantic features.

Result: Outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art learning-based methods on Real-Estate10K dataset, including MASt3R.

Conclusion: Bridging single-view perception with multi-view geometry enables robust and metric relative pose estimation without requiring explicit 2D correspondences.

Abstract: Estimating metric relative camera pose from a pair of images is of great
importance for 3D reconstruction and localisation. However, conventional
two-view pose estimation methods are not metric, with camera translation known
only up to a scale, and struggle with wide baselines and textureless or
reflective surfaces. This paper introduces GARPS, a training-free framework
that casts this problem as the direct alignment of two independently
reconstructed 3D scenes. GARPS leverages a metric monocular depth estimator and
a Gaussian scene reconstructor to obtain a metric 3D Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) for each image. It then refines an initial pose from a feed-forward
two-view pose estimator by optimising a differentiable GMM alignment objective.
This objective jointly considers geometric structure, view-independent colour,
anisotropic covariance, and semantic feature consistency, and is robust to
occlusions and texture-poor regions without requiring explicit 2D
correspondences. Extensive experiments on the Real\-Estate10K dataset
demonstrate that GARPS outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art
learning-based methods, including MASt3R. These results highlight the potential
of bridging single-view perception with multi-view geometry to achieve robust
and metric relative pose estimation.

*Yulan Guo,Longguang Wang,Wendong Mao,Xiaoyu Dong,Yingqian Wang,Li Liu,Wei An*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes replacing multiplication operations in CNNs with efficient lookup operations to reduce computational complexity and energy consumption, enabling better deployment on mobile/edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiplication operations in CNNs are computationally intensive and energy-consuming, hindering deployment on resource-limited mobile devices. The authors aim to replace these with more efficient lookup operations.

Method: Introduces a generic, differentiable lookup operation that replaces weight-activation multiplications. Constructs lookup tables in a differentiable manner with specialized training strategies for convergence. Applies this to image classification, super-resolution, and point cloud classification tasks.

Result: Lookup networks achieve higher efficiency in energy consumption and inference speed while maintaining competitive performance compared to vanilla convolutional networks. State-of-the-art performance on both classification and regression tasks across different data types.

Conclusion: Lookup operations provide an effective alternative to multiplication operations in neural networks, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks are constructed with massive operations with
different types and are highly computationally intensive. Among these
operations, multiplication operation is higher in computational complexity and
usually requires {more} energy consumption with longer inference time than
other operations, which hinders the deployment of convolutional neural networks
on mobile devices. In many resource-limited edge devices, complicated
operations can be calculated via lookup tables to reduce computational cost.
Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce a generic and efficient lookup
operation which can be used as a basic operation for the construction of neural
networks. Instead of calculating the multiplication of weights and activation
values, simple yet efficient lookup operations are adopted to compute their
responses. To enable end-to-end optimization of the lookup operation, we
construct the lookup tables in a differentiable manner and propose several
training strategies to promote their convergence. By replacing computationally
expensive multiplication operations with our lookup operations, we develop
lookup networks for the image classification, image super-resolution, and point
cloud classification tasks. It is demonstrated that our lookup networks can
benefit from the lookup operations to achieve higher efficiency in terms of
energy consumption and inference speed while maintaining competitive
performance to vanilla convolutional networks. Extensive experiments show that
our lookup networks produce state-of-the-art performance on different tasks
(both classification and regression tasks) and different data types (both
images and point clouds).

*Xiaobo Yang,Xiaojin Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel semantic visual projector using SAM-generated superpixels as visual words, reducing visual tokens by 93% while maintaining RIS performance and accelerating MLLM training/inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional patch-wise visual projectors in RIS frameworks suffer from visual token redundancy and struggle to balance token reduction with semantic preservation, requiring overly long token sequences to avoid performance drops.

Method: Proposes semantic visual projector using SAM-generated superpixels as visual words, with semantic superpixel positional embedding for geometry awareness and semantic superpixel aggregator to preserve fine details and global context.

Result: Achieves 93% reduction in visual tokens without performance compromise, significantly speeds up MLLM training and inference, and outperforms existing compressive visual projectors on RIS tasks.

Conclusion: The semantic visual projector approach effectively addresses visual token redundancy in MLLM-SAM frameworks, enabling efficient compression while preserving semantic clarity and improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) frameworks that pair the
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
have achieved impressive results. However, adapting MLLM to segmentation is
computationally intensive, primarily due to visual token redundancy. We observe
that traditional patch-wise visual projectors struggle to strike a balance
between reducing the number of visual tokens and preserving semantic clarity,
often retaining overly long token sequences to avoid performance drops.
Inspired by text tokenizers, we propose a novel semantic visual projector that
leverages semantic superpixels generated by SAM to identify "visual words" in
an image. By compressing and projecting semantic superpixels as visual tokens,
our approach adaptively shortens the token sequence according to scene
complexity while minimizing semantic loss in compression. To mitigate loss of
information, we propose a semantic superpixel positional embedding to
strengthen MLLM's awareness of superpixel geometry and position, alongside a
semantic superpixel aggregator to preserve both fine-grained details inside
superpixels and global context outside. Experiments show that our method cuts
visual tokens by 93% without compromising performance, notably speeding up MLLM
training and inference, and outperforming existing compressive visual
projectors on RIS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FishBEV is a novel BEV segmentation framework specifically designed for fisheye cameras that addresses distortion, multi-view alignment, and temporal coherence challenges through three key innovations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BEV segmentation methods work well with pinhole cameras but perform poorly with fisheye cameras due to severe geometric distortion, ambiguous multi-view correspondences, and unstable temporal dynamics.

Method: Three complementary innovations: 1) Distortion-Resilient Multi-scale Extraction backbone for robust feature learning, 2) Uncertainty-aware Spatial Cross-Attention for reliable cross-view alignment, 3) Distance-aware Temporal Self-Attention for temporal coherence balancing near/far field details.

Result: Extensive experiments on Synwoodscapes dataset show FishBEV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on surround-view fisheye BEV segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: FishBEV successfully addresses the unique challenges of fisheye cameras in BEV segmentation through specialized architectural components, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: As a cornerstone technique for autonomous driving, Bird's Eye View (BEV)
segmentation has recently achieved remarkable progress with pinhole cameras.
However, it is non-trivial to extend the existing methods to fisheye cameras
with severe geometric distortion, ambiguous multi-view correspondences and
unstable temporal dynamics, all of which significantly degrade BEV performance.
To address these challenges, we propose FishBEV, a novel BEV segmentation
framework specifically tailored for fisheye cameras. This framework introduces
three complementary innovations, including a Distortion-Resilient Multi-scale
Extraction (DRME) backbone that learns robust features under distortion while
preserving scale consistency, an Uncertainty-aware Spatial Cross-Attention
(U-SCA) mechanism that leverages uncertainty estimation for reliable cross-view
alignment, a Distance-aware Temporal Self-Attention (D-TSA) module that
adaptively balances near field details and far field context to ensure temporal
coherence. Extensive experiments on the Synwoodscapes dataset demonstrate that
FishBEV consistently outperforms SOTA baselines, regarding the performance
evaluation of FishBEV on the surround-view fisheye BEV segmentation tasks.

*Kaniz Fatema,Emad A. Mohammed,Sukhjit Singh Sehra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spline-based KANs (SBTAYLOR-KAN, SBRBF-KAN, SBWAVELET-KAN) achieve high accuracy medical image classification with minimal parameters (2,872 vs millions in CNNs), offering interpretability and strong performance on limited, diverse datasets without preprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of effective and interpretable medical image classification in resource-limited clinical settings with limited, diverse datasets, where traditional CNNs require millions of parameters and extensive preprocessing.

Method: Developed three spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: SBTAYLOR-KAN (B-splines + Taylor series), SBRBF-KAN (B-splines + Radial Basis Functions), SBWAVELET-KAN (B-splines + Morlet wavelet transforms) to capture local and global nonlinearities. Evaluated on brain MRI, chest X-rays, tuberculosis X-rays, and skin lesion images without preprocessing.

Result: SBTAYLOR-KAN achieved up to 98.93% accuracy with balanced F1-score, maintained over 86% accuracy using only 30% training data, and outperformed other models on imbalanced skin cancer dataset (68.22% accuracy). Used only 2,872 parameters vs 24.18M in ResNet50. Grad-CAM provided interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework provides a lightweight, interpretable, and generalizable solution for medical image classification, effectively addressing challenges of limited datasets and data-scarce scenarios in clinical AI applications with minimal computational requirements.

Abstract: Effective and interpretable classification of medical images is a challenge
in computer-aided diagnosis, especially in resource-limited clinical settings.
This study introduces spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for
accurate medical image classification with limited, diverse datasets. The
models include SBTAYLOR-KAN, integrating B-splines with Taylor series;
SBRBF-KAN, combining B-splines with Radial Basis Functions; and SBWAVELET-KAN,
embedding B-splines in Morlet wavelet transforms. These approaches leverage
spline-based function approximation to capture both local and global
nonlinearities. The models were evaluated on brain MRI, chest X-rays,
tuberculosis X-rays, and skin lesion images without preprocessing,
demonstrating the ability to learn directly from raw data. Extensive
experiments, including cross-dataset validation and data reduction analysis,
showed strong generalization and stability. SBTAYLOR-KAN achieved up to 98.93%
accuracy, with a balanced F1-score, maintaining over 86% accuracy using only
30% of the training data across three datasets. Despite class imbalance in the
skin cancer dataset, experiments on both imbalanced and balanced versions
showed SBTAYLOR-KAN outperforming other models, achieving 68.22% accuracy.
Unlike traditional CNNs, which require millions of parameters (e.g., ResNet50
with 24.18M), SBTAYLOR-KAN achieves comparable performance with just 2,872
trainable parameters, making it more suitable for constrained medical
environments. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was used
for interpretability, highlighting relevant regions in medical images. This
framework provides a lightweight, interpretable, and generalizable solution for
medical image classification, addressing the challenges of limited datasets and
data-scarce scenarios in clinical AI applications.

### [33] [StyleProtect: Safeguarding Artistic Identity in Fine-tuned Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13711)
*Qiuyu Tang,Joshua Krinsky,Aparna Bharati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StyleProtect is an efficient protection method that defends artistic styles against malicious diffusion model fine-tuning by selectively updating sensitive cross-attention layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of generative models enables easy style mimicry that threatens artists' creative labor and intellectual property, creating an urgent need for artwork protection.

Method: Identifies style-sensitive cross-attention layers through activation analysis, then selectively updates only these layers to create a lightweight defense mechanism against style replication.

Result: Effective protection against fine-tuned diffusion models while maintaining competitive imperceptibility, demonstrated on WikiArt artworks and Anita cartoon animations.

Conclusion: StyleProtect provides an efficient and practical solution for safeguarding artistic styles from malicious diffusion customization with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models, particularly diffusion-based
approaches, has inadvertently facilitated their potential for misuse. Such
models enable malicious exploiters to replicate artistic styles that capture an
artist's creative labor, personal vision, and years of dedication in an
inexpensive manner. This has led to a rise in the need and exploration of
methods for protecting artworks against style mimicry. Although generic
diffusion models can easily mimic an artistic style, finetuning amplifies this
capability, enabling the model to internalize and reproduce the style with
higher fidelity and control. We hypothesize that certain cross-attention layers
exhibit heightened sensitivity to artistic styles. Sensitivity is measured
through activation strengths of attention layers in response to style and
content representations, and assessing their correlations with features
extracted from external models. Based on our findings, we introduce an
efficient and lightweight protection strategy, StyleProtect, that achieves
effective style defense against fine-tuned diffusion models by updating only
selected cross-attention layers. Our experiments utilize a carefully curated
artwork dataset based on WikiArt, comprising representative works from 30
artists known for their distinctive and influential styles and cartoon
animations from the Anita dataset. The proposed method demonstrates promising
performance in safeguarding unique styles of artworks and anime from malicious
diffusion customization, while maintaining competitive imperceptibility.

*Tae-Wook Um,Ki-Hyeon Kim,Hyun-Duck Choi,Hyo-Sung Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UM-Depth is a self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework that uses uncertainty-aware refinement and teacher-student training to improve accuracy in challenging regions like dynamic object boundaries and textureless areas, without adding inference-time overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods struggle with uncertainty in input data (low-texture or dynamic regions), leading to reduced depth accuracy. Existing motion-aware approaches require inference-time overhead and additional labels/auxiliary networks.

Method: Introduces UM-Depth framework with motion- and uncertainty-aware refinement. Uses teacher-student training strategy that embeds uncertainty estimation into both training pipeline and network architecture. Optical flow is used exclusively in teacher network during training, eliminating runtime costs and extra labeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in both self-supervised depth and pose estimation on KITTI datasets. Extensive experiments on KITTI and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate effectiveness of uncertainty-aware refinement.

Conclusion: UM-Depth effectively addresses uncertainty challenges in self-supervised monocular depth estimation without inference-time overhead, achieving superior performance through uncertainty-aware refinement and efficient teacher-student training strategy.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has been increasingly adopted in robotics and
autonomous driving for its ability to infer scene geometry from a single
camera. In self-supervised monocular depth estimation frameworks, the network
jointly generates and exploits depth and pose estimates during training,
thereby eliminating the need for depth labels. However, these methods remain
challenged by uncertainty in the input data, such as low-texture or dynamic
regions, which can cause reduced depth accuracy. To address this, we introduce
UM-Depth, a framework that combines motion- and uncertainty-aware refinement to
enhance depth accuracy at dynamic object boundaries and in textureless regions.
Specifically, we develop a teacherstudent training strategy that embeds
uncertainty estimation into both the training pipeline and network
architecture, thereby strengthening supervision where photometric signals are
weak. Unlike prior motion-aware approaches that incur inference-time overhead
and rely on additional labels or auxiliary networks for real-time generation,
our method uses optical flow exclusively within the teacher network during
training, which eliminating extra labeling demands and any runtime cost.
Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our uncertainty-aware refinement. Overall, UM-Depth achieves
state-of-the-art results in both self-supervised depth and pose estimation on
the KITTI datasets.

*Dingwei Zhang,Dong Zhang,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TQF addresses query selection bias in RVOS by decomposing referring queries into three specialized components (appearance, intra-frame interaction, inter-frame motion) and using motion-aware aggregation modules to improve cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing query-based RVOS methods suffer from query selection bias where static textual queries are easily misled by distractors with similar appearance or motion, leading to inaccurate segmentation.

Method: Proposes Triple Query Former (TQF) that factorizes queries into three specialized components and introduces two motion-aware aggregation modules (Intra-frame Interaction Aggregation and Inter-frame Motion Aggregation) to enhance object token representations with both linguistic cues and visual guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of TQF and the effectiveness of the structured query design and motion-aware aggregation modules.

Conclusion: The proposed TQF framework successfully addresses query selection bias through specialized query factorization and motion-aware aggregation, achieving improved performance in referring video object segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Recently, query-based methods have achieved remarkable performance in
Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) by using textual static object
queries to drive cross-modal alignment. However, these static queries are
easily misled by distractors with similar appearance or motion, resulting in
\emph{query selection bias}. To address this issue, we propose Triple Query
Former (TQF), which factorizes the referring query into three specialized
components: an appearance query for static attributes, an intra-frame
interaction query for spatial relations, and an inter-frame motion query for
temporal association. Instead of relying solely on textual embeddings, our
queries are dynamically constructed by integrating both linguistic cues and
visual guidance. Furthermore, we introduce two motion-aware aggregation modules
that enhance object token representations: Intra-frame Interaction Aggregation
incorporates position-aware interactions among objects within a single frame,
while Inter-frame Motion Aggregation leverages trajectory-guided alignment
across frames to ensure temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of TQF and the effectiveness of our
structured query design and motion-aware aggregation modules.

### [36] [Improving Generalized Visual Grounding with Instance-aware Joint Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13747)
*Ming Dai,Wenxuan Cheng,Jiang-Jiang Liu,Lingfeng Yang,Zhenhua Feng,Wankou Yang,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstanceVG is a unified framework that jointly handles Generalized Referring Expression Comprehension (GREC) and Segmentation (GRES) with instance-aware capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat GREC and GRES independently, overlook multi-granularity consistency, and neglect instance-aware capabilities in segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposes InstanceVG framework using instance queries with prior reference points to unify joint predictions of instance-level boxes and masks, ensuring consistent point-box-mask predictions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten datasets across four tasks, significantly surpassing existing methods in various evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: InstanceVG successfully addresses limitations of previous approaches by providing a unified framework with instance-aware capabilities for generalized visual grounding tasks.

Abstract: Generalized visual grounding tasks, including Generalized Referring
Expression Comprehension (GREC) and Segmentation (GRES), extend the classical
visual grounding paradigm by accommodating multi-target and non-target
scenarios. Specifically, GREC focuses on accurately identifying all referential
objects at the coarse bounding box level, while GRES aims for achieve
fine-grained pixel-level perception. However, existing approaches typically
treat these tasks independently, overlooking the benefits of jointly training
GREC and GRES to ensure consistent multi-granularity predictions and streamline
the overall process. Moreover, current methods often treat GRES as a semantic
segmentation task, neglecting the crucial role of instance-aware capabilities
and the necessity of ensuring consistent predictions between instance-level
boxes and masks. To address these limitations, we propose InstanceVG, a
multi-task generalized visual grounding framework equipped with instance-aware
capabilities, which leverages instance queries to unify the joint and
consistency predictions of instance-level boxes and masks. To the best of our
knowledge, InstanceVG is the first framework to simultaneously tackle both GREC
and GRES while incorporating instance-aware capabilities into generalized
visual grounding. To instantiate the framework, we assign each instance query a
prior reference point, which also serves as an additional basis for target
matching. This design facilitates consistent predictions of points, boxes, and
masks for the same instance. Extensive experiments obtained on ten datasets
across four tasks demonstrate that InstanceVG achieves state-of-the-art
performance, significantly surpassing the existing methods in various
evaluation metrics. The code and model will be publicly available at
https://github.com/Dmmm1997/InstanceVG.

### [37] [Cross-modal Full-mode Fine-grained Alignment for Text-to-Image Person Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13754)
*Hao Yin,Xin Man,Feiyu Chen,Jie Shao,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMFA is a cross-modal full-mode fine-grained alignment framework for text-to-image person retrieval that enhances global matching through explicit fine-grained alignment and implicit relational reasoning without additional supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack verification capability for local feature alignment and primarily focus on hard negative samples while neglecting incorrectly matched positive pairs, limiting cross-modal matching effectiveness.

Method: Proposes two modules: 1) Adaptive Similarity Distribution Matching (A-SDM) to rectify unmatched positive sample pairs by adaptively pulling them closer, and 2) Explicit Fine-grained Alignment (EFA) that strengthens explicit cross-modal interactions through similarity matrix sparsification and hard coding for local alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets among all global matching methods for text-to-image person retrieval.

Conclusion: FMFA effectively addresses the limitations of prior approaches by providing both explicit fine-grained alignment verification and improved handling of unmatched positive pairs, leading to superior cross-modal matching performance.

Abstract: Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) is a cross-modal matching task that
aims to retrieve the most relevant person images based on a given text query.
The key challenge in TIPR lies in achieving effective alignment between textual
and visual modalities within a common latent space. To address this challenge,
prior approaches incorporate attention mechanisms for implicit cross-modal
local alignment. However, they lack the ability to verify whether all local
features are correctly aligned. Moreover, existing methods primarily focus on
hard negative samples during model updates, with the goal of refining
distinctions between positive and negative pairs, often neglecting incorrectly
matched positive pairs. To alleviate these issues, we propose FMFA, a
cross-modal Full-Mode Fine-grained Alignment framework, which enhances global
matching through explicit fine-grained alignment and existing implicit
relational reasoning -- hence the term ``full-mode" -- without requiring
additional supervision. Specifically, we design an Adaptive Similarity
Distribution Matching (A-SDM) module to rectify unmatched positive sample
pairs. A-SDM adaptively pulls the unmatched positive pairs closer in the joint
embedding space, thereby achieving more precise global alignment. Additionally,
we introduce an Explicit Fine-grained Alignment (EFA) module, which makes up
for the lack of verification capability of implicit relational reasoning. EFA
strengthens explicit cross-modal fine-grained interactions by sparsifying the
similarity matrix and employs a hard coding method for local alignment. Our
proposed method is evaluated on three public datasets, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among all global matching methods. Our code is
available at https://github.com/yinhao1102/FMFA.

*Yuqi Yang,Dongliang Chang,Yuanchen Fang,Yi-Zhe SonG,Zhanyu Ma,Jun Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A color mapping module that bridges text embedding space with RGB values for precise, continuous color control in text-driven image editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-driven image editing struggles with precise color control due to language ambiguity and lack of continuous control over color variations.

Method: Introduces a color mapping module that explicitly models correspondence between text embedding space and RGB values, predicting embedding vectors from given RGB values.

Result: Enables precise color control with continuous variations within specified RGB ranges while maintaining semantic consistency in generated images.

Conclusion: The method achieves superior color continuity and controllability compared to existing approaches, providing finer-grained color editing capabilities.

Abstract: In recent years, text-driven image editing has made significant progress.
However, due to the inherent ambiguity and discreteness of natural language,
color editing still faces challenges such as insufficient precision and
difficulty in achieving continuous control. Although linearly interpolating the
embedding vectors of different textual descriptions can guide the model to
generate a sequence of images with varying colors, this approach lacks precise
control over the range of color changes in the output images. Moreover, the
relationship between the interpolation coefficient and the resulting image
color is unknown and uncontrollable. To address these issues, we introduce a
color mapping module that explicitly models the correspondence between the text
embedding space and image RGB values. This module predicts the corresponding
embedding vector based on a given RGB value, enabling precise color control of
the generated images while maintaining semantic consistency. Users can specify
a target RGB range to generate images with continuous color variations within
the desired range, thereby achieving finer-grained, continuous, and
controllable color editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
performs well in terms of color continuity and controllability.

*Jinwoo Jeon,JunHyeok Oh,Hayeong Lee,Byung-Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes iterative prompt refinement using vision-language models to analyze both text prompts and generated images for safer text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety methods only refine text prompts using LLMs but ignore the actual generated images, which can result in unsafe outputs or unnecessary changes to safe prompts.

Method: Iterative prompt refinement algorithm that uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to analyze both input prompts and generated images, leveraging visual feedback for more effective refinement.

Result: Produces safer outputs without compromising alignment with user intent, with reliability comparable to existing LLM-based approaches.

Conclusion: Offers a practical solution for generating safer T2I content by incorporating visual feedback into prompt refinement process.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating images
from text prompts, but their output quality and safety still depend heavily on
how prompts are phrased. Existing safety methods typically refine prompts using
large language models (LLMs), but they overlook the images produced, which can
result in unsafe outputs or unnecessary changes to already safe prompts. To
address this, we propose an iterative prompt refinement algorithm that uses
Vision Language Models (VLMs) to analyze both the input prompts and the
generated images. By leveraging visual feedback, our method refines prompts
more effectively, improving safety while maintaining user intent and
reliability comparable to existing LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we
introduce a new dataset labeled with both textual and visual safety signals
using off-the-shelf multi-modal LLM, enabling supervised fine-tuning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach produces safer outputs
without compromising alignment with user intent, offering a practical solution
for generating safer T2I content. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TA-ISP is a lightweight RAW-to-RGB framework that uses multi-scale modulation operators instead of heavy convolutional pipelines to improve downstream vision tasks while reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAW data processing methods either use computationally intensive ISP networks or are limited by traditional ISP pipelines' representational capacity, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices.

Method: Proposes Task-Aware Image Signal Processing (TA-ISP) that predicts lightweight multi-scale modulation operators (global, regional, pixel scales) to reshape image statistics without dense convolutional pipelines.

Result: TA-ISP consistently improves accuracy on RAW-domain detection and segmentation benchmarks under both daytime and nighttime conditions while significantly reducing parameter count and inference time.

Conclusion: TA-ISP provides an efficient solution for leveraging RAW sensor data in vision tasks, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices due to its compact design and performance improvements.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing trend in computer vision towards
exploiting RAW sensor data, which preserves richer information compared to
conventional low-bit RGB images. Early studies mainly focused on enhancing
visual quality, while more recent efforts aim to leverage the abundant
information in RAW data to improve the performance of visual perception tasks
such as object detection and segmentation. However, existing approaches still
face two key limitations: large-scale ISP networks impose heavy computational
overhead, while methods based on tuning traditional ISP pipelines are
restricted by limited representational capacity.To address these issues, we
propose Task-Aware Image Signal Processing (TA-ISP), a compact RAW-to-RGB
framework that produces task-oriented representations for pretrained vision
models. Instead of heavy dense convolutional pipelines, TA-ISP predicts a small
set of lightweight, multi-scale modulation operators that act at global,
regional, and pixel scales to reshape image statistics across different spatial
extents. This factorized control significantly expands the range of spatially
varying transforms that can be represented while keeping memory usage,
computation, and latency tightly constrained. Evaluated on several RAW-domain
detection and segmentation benchmarks under both daytime and nighttime
conditions, TA-ISP consistently improves downstream accuracy while markedly
reducing parameter count and inference time, making it well suited for
deployment on resource-constrained devices.

TL;DR: A novel nighttime deraining network (NDLPNet) with position perception module that effectively removes rain streaks while preserving background information in low-light conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deraining techniques perform poorly in nighttime conditions due to spatial heterogeneity of rain distribution and light-dependent stripe visibility, which hampers nighttime surveillance and autonomous navigation.

Method: Proposed Nighttime Deraining Location-enhanced Perceptual Network (NDLPNet) with Position Perception Module (PPM) to capture spatial positional information and density distribution of rain streaks. Also constructed a new NSR dataset with 900 real-world nighttime image pairs.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in nighttime deraining tasks on both existing datasets and the new NSR benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: NDLPNet effectively addresses nighttime deraining challenges by capturing spatial context and rain distribution, providing superior performance while preserving crucial background information in low-light conditions.

Abstract: Visual degradation caused by rain streak artifacts in low-light conditions
significantly hampers the performance of nighttime surveillance and autonomous
navigation. Existing image deraining techniques are primarily designed for
daytime conditions and perform poorly under nighttime illumination due to the
spatial heterogeneity of rain distribution and the impact of light-dependent
stripe visibility. In this paper, we propose a novel Nighttime Deraining
Location-enhanced Perceptual Network(NDLPNet) that effectively captures the
spatial positional information and density distribution of rain streaks in
low-light environments. Specifically, we introduce a Position Perception Module
(PPM) to capture and leverage spatial contextual information from input data,
enhancing the model's capability to identify and recalibrate the importance of
different feature channels. The proposed nighttime deraining network can
effectively remove the rain streaks as well as preserve the crucial background
information. Furthermore, We construct a night scene rainy (NSR) dataset
comprising 900 image pairs, all based on real-world nighttime scenes, providing
a new benchmark for nighttime deraining task research. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experimental evaluations on both existing datasets and the NSR
dataset consistently demonstrate our method outperform the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods in nighttime deraining tasks. The source code and dataset is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for segmenting articulatory structures in rtMRI rely mainly on visual cues, but synchronized acoustic and phonological signals provide complementary context that can enhance precision and enrich visual information.

Method: The framework uses cross-attention fusion for dynamic feature alignment between video, audio, and phonological inputs, and incorporates contrastive learning to improve cross-modal representation and segmentation performance even when audio is unavailable during inference.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on USC-75 rtMRI dataset with Dice score of 0.95 and HD_95 of 4.20 mm, outperforming both unimodal and multimodal baselines. Ablation studies confirmed the contributions of cross-attention and contrastive learning.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the value of integrative multimodal modeling for accurate vocal tract analysis, showing that combining multiple modalities through advanced fusion techniques significantly improves segmentation precision and robustness.

Abstract: Accurately segmenting articulatory structures in real-time magnetic resonance
imaging (rtMRI) remains challenging, as most existing methods rely almost
entirely on visual cues. Yet synchronized acoustic and phonological signals
provide complementary context that can enrich visual information and improve
precision. In this paper, we introduce VocSegMRI, a multimodal framework that
integrates video, audio, and phonological inputs through cross-attention fusion
for dynamic feature alignment. To further enhance cross-modal representation,
we incorporate a contrastive learning objective that improves segmentation
performance even when the audio modality is unavailable at inference. Evaluated
on a sub-set of USC-75 rtMRI dataset, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with a Dice score of 0.95 and a 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance
(HD_95) of 4.20 mm, outperforming both unimodal and multimodal baselines.
Ablation studies confirm the contributions of cross-attention and contrastive
learning to segmentation precision and robustness. These results highlight the
value of integrative multimodal modeling for accurate vocal tract analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel generative coding framework using diffusion priors for high compression with superior perceptual quality at low bitrates, outperforming traditional codecs by up to 79%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional codecs and learned methods struggle with subjective quality at high compression, while generative approaches face fidelity and generalization issues with mixed natural/AI-generated content.

Method: Uses pre-optimized encoder for compressed-domain representations, integrated with pretrained diffusion models via lightweight adapter and attentive fusion module, plus distribution renormalization for fidelity.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in visual fidelity at low bitrates, achieves 79% compression improvement over H.266/VVC, and efficiently handles AI-generated content with broad adaptability.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages pretrained diffusion models for superior compression performance while maintaining high visual quality and requiring minimal retraining for new requirements.

Abstract: As generative technologies advance, visual content has evolved into a complex
mix of natural and AI-generated images, driving the need for more efficient
coding techniques that prioritize perceptual quality. Traditional codecs and
learned methods struggle to maintain subjective quality at high compression
ratios, while existing generative approaches face challenges in visual fidelity
and generalization. To this end, we propose a novel generative coding framework
leveraging diffusion priors to enhance compression performance at low bitrates.
Our approach employs a pre-optimized encoder to generate generalized
compressed-domain representations, integrated with the pretrained model's
internal features via a lightweight adapter and an attentive fusion module.
This framework effectively leverages existing pretrained diffusion models and
enables efficient adaptation to different pretrained models for new
requirements with minimal retraining costs. We also introduce a distribution
renormalization method to further enhance reconstruction fidelity. Extensive
experiments show that our method (1) outperforms existing methods in visual
fidelity across low bitrates, (2) improves compression performance by up to 79%
over H.266/VVC, and (3) offers an efficient solution for AI-generated content
while being adaptable to broader content types.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaThinkDrive is a novel VLA framework with dual-mode reasoning (fast/slow thinking) that adaptively applies Chain of Thought reasoning only when needed, achieving better performance and 14% faster inference than always-thinking baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CoT reasoning in VLA models for autonomous driving introduces unnecessary computational overhead in simple scenarios without improving decision quality, requiring a more adaptive approach.

Method: Pretrained on large-scale AD scenarios with QA and trajectory data, then fine-tuned with two-mode dataset (fast answering without CoT, slow thinking with CoT). Uses Adaptive Think Reward strategy with Group Relative Policy Optimization to reward selective CoT application.

Result: Achieves PDMS of 90.3 on Navsim benchmark (1.7 points better than best vision-only baseline), surpasses never-Think and always-Think baselines by 2.0 and 1.4 points respectively, with 14% faster inference time.

Conclusion: AdaThinkDrive effectively balances accuracy and efficiency through adaptive reasoning, demonstrating superior performance while reducing computational overhead by applying CoT only when necessary.

Abstract: While reasoning technology like Chain of Thought (CoT) has been widely
adopted in Vision Language Action (VLA) models, it demonstrates promising
capabilities in end to end autonomous driving. However, recent efforts to
integrate CoT reasoning often fall short in simple scenarios, introducing
unnecessary computational overhead without improving decision quality. To
address this, we propose AdaThinkDrive, a novel VLA framework with a dual mode
reasoning mechanism inspired by fast and slow thinking. First, our framework is
pretrained on large scale autonomous driving (AD) scenarios using both question
answering (QA) and trajectory datasets to acquire world knowledge and driving
commonsense. During supervised fine tuning (SFT), we introduce a two mode
dataset, fast answering (w/o CoT) and slow thinking (with CoT), enabling the
model to distinguish between scenarios that require reasoning. Furthermore, an
Adaptive Think Reward strategy is proposed in conjunction with the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which rewards the model for selectively
applying CoT by comparing trajectory quality across different reasoning modes.
Extensive experiments on the Navsim benchmark show that AdaThinkDrive achieves
a PDMS of 90.3, surpassing the best vision only baseline by 1.7 points.
Moreover, ablations show that AdaThinkDrive surpasses both the never Think and
always Think baselines, improving PDMS by 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. It also
reduces inference time by 14% compared to the always Think baseline,
demonstrating its ability to balance accuracy and efficiency through adaptive
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deepfake localization approach that independently predicts manipulated regions from both local and global perspectives, using morphological operations for effective fusion to suppress noise and enhance spatial coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While deepfake detection accuracy has improved, precise localization of manipulated regions remains challenging. Current approaches neglect the complementary nature of local detail and global semantic context, and naive fusion strategies amplify noise and errors.

Method: Proposes independent prediction of manipulated regions using both local and global perspectives, followed by morphological operations to fuse outputs for noise suppression and spatial coherence enhancement.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness of each module in improving accuracy and robustness of forgery localization.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses localization challenges by leveraging complementary local and global perspectives with intelligent fusion, demonstrating improved performance in deepfake region localization.

Abstract: While the pursuit of higher accuracy in deepfake detection remains a central
goal, there is an increasing demand for precise localization of manipulated
regions. Despite the remarkable progress made in classification-based
detection, accurately localizing forged areas remains a significant challenge.
A common strategy is to incorporate forged region annotations during model
training alongside manipulated images. However, such approaches often neglect
the complementary nature of local detail and global semantic context, resulting
in suboptimal localization performance. Moreover, an often-overlooked aspect is
the fusion strategy between local and global predictions. Naively combining the
outputs from both branches can amplify noise and errors, thereby undermining
the effectiveness of the localization.
  To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that independently
predicts manipulated regions using both local and global perspectives. We
employ morphological operations to fuse the outputs, effectively suppressing
noise while enhancing spatial coherence. Extensive experiments reveal the
effectiveness of each module in improving the accuracy and robustness of
forgery localization.

TL;DR: A novel Variable-Rate Spatial Event Mamba architecture that directly processes raw event streams without intermediate representations, using spatial encoding and Mamba-based state space models for efficient temporal modeling with adaptive processing speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event camera methods require predefined time windows that introduce latency, while pointwise detection methods are computationally expensive and prevent real-time efficiency. There's a need for direct raw event stream processing without intermediate representations.

Method: Lightweight causal spatial neighborhood encoder to capture local geometric relations, followed by Mamba-based state space models for scalable temporal modeling with linear complexity. Adaptive controller adjusts processing speed based on event rate during inference.

Result: The method achieves optimal balance between window latency and inference latency by directly processing raw event streams without intermediate representations like frames, voxel grids, or point clouds.

Conclusion: The proposed Variable-Rate Spatial Event Mamba overcomes limitations of existing methods by enabling direct raw event stream processing with efficient spatial encoding and linear-complexity temporal modeling, achieving real-time performance through adaptive rate control.

Abstract: Event cameras capture asynchronous pixel-level brightness changes with
microsecond temporal resolution, offering unique advantages for high-speed
vision tasks. Existing methods often convert event streams into intermediate
representations such as frames, voxel grids, or point clouds, which inevitably
require predefined time windows and thus introduce window latency. Meanwhile,
pointwise detection methods face computational challenges that prevent
real-time efficiency due to their high computational cost. To overcome these
limitations, we propose the Variable-Rate Spatial Event Mamba, a novel
architecture that directly processes raw event streams without intermediate
representations. Our method introduces a lightweight causal spatial
neighborhood encoder to efficiently capture local geometric relations, followed
by Mamba-based state space models for scalable temporal modeling with linear
complexity. During inference, a controller adaptively adjusts the processing
speed according to the event rate, achieving an optimal balance between window
latency and inference latency.

*Hanshuai Cui,Zhiqing Tang,Zhifei Xu,Zhi Yao,Wenyi Zeng,Weijia Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BWCache is a training-free method that accelerates Diffusion Transformer video generation by caching and reusing features across timesteps when similarity is high, achieving 2.24x speedup without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers suffer from sequential denoising latency that limits real-world applicability, and existing acceleration methods either compromise quality or fail to reuse features effectively.

Method: Proposes Block-Wise Caching (BWCache) that dynamically caches and reuses DiT block features across diffusion timesteps, using a similarity indicator to trigger reuse only when feature differences are below a threshold.

Result: Achieves up to 2.24x speedup on several video diffusion models while maintaining comparable visual quality to original models.

Conclusion: BWCache effectively reduces computational redundancy in DiT-based video generation through intelligent feature caching, enabling significant acceleration without training or quality degradation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have established them as
the state-of-the-art method for video generation. However, their inherently
sequential denoising process results in inevitable latency, limiting real-world
applicability. Existing acceleration methods either compromise visual quality
due to architectural modifications or fail to reuse intermediate features at
proper granularity. Our analysis reveals that DiT blocks are the primary
contributors to inference latency. Across diffusion timesteps, the feature
variations of DiT blocks exhibit a U-shaped pattern with high similarity during
intermediate timesteps, which suggests substantial computational redundancy. In
this paper, we propose Block-Wise Caching (BWCache), a training-free method to
accelerate DiT-based video generation. BWCache dynamically caches and reuses
features from DiT blocks across diffusion timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce
a similarity indicator that triggers feature reuse only when the differences
between block features at adjacent timesteps fall below a threshold, thereby
minimizing redundant computations while maintaining visual fidelity. Extensive
experiments on several video diffusion models demonstrate that BWCache achieves
up to 2.24$\times$ speedup with comparable visual quality.

TL;DR: A supervised domain adaptation framework for spacecraft pose estimation that uses both synthetic and limited real data to bridge the domain gap, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal labeled real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid spacecraft pose estimation pipelines perform well on synthetic data but suffer from synthetic-to-real domain gap. Existing unsupervised approaches underperform when limited labeled target data is available.

Method: Proposes a Supervised Domain Adaptation framework based on Learning Invariant Representation and Risk (LIRR) paradigm, jointly optimizing domain-invariant representations and task-specific risk using labeled synthetic and limited real data.

Result: Outperforms source-only, fine-tuning, and oracle baselines on SPEED+ benchmark. With only 5% labeled target data, matches or surpasses oracle performance trained on larger data fractions.

Conclusion: The framework is lightweight, backbone-agnostic, and computationally efficient, providing a practical solution for robust spacecraft pose estimation in real-world space environments.

Abstract: Spacecraft Pose Estimation (SPE) is a fundamental capability for autonomous
space operations such as rendezvous, docking, and in-orbit servicing. Hybrid
pipelines that combine object detection, keypoint regression, and
Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solvers have recently achieved strong results on
synthetic datasets, yet their performance deteriorates sharply on real or
lab-generated imagery due to the persistent synthetic-to-real domain gap.
Existing unsupervised domain adaptation approaches aim to mitigate this issue
but often underperform when a modest number of labeled target samples are
available. In this work, we propose the first Supervised Domain Adaptation
(SDA) framework tailored for SPE keypoint regression. Building on the Learning
Invariant Representation and Risk (LIRR) paradigm, our method jointly optimizes
domain-invariant representations and task-specific risk using both labeled
synthetic and limited labeled real data, thereby reducing generalization error
under domain shift. Extensive experiments on the SPEED+ benchmark demonstrate
that our approach consistently outperforms source-only, fine-tuning, and oracle
baselines. Notably, with only 5% labeled target data, our method matches or
surpasses oracle performance trained on larger fractions of labeled data. The
framework is lightweight, backbone-agnostic, and computationally efficient,
offering a practical pathway toward robust and deployable spacecraft pose
estimation in real-world space environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-based UAV localization systems face limitations in real-time performance, environmental sensitivity, and generalization capability, especially in dynamic or temporally varying environments with limited dataset availability.

Method: Proposes Semantic-Weighted Adaptive Particle Filter (SWA-PF) that integrates semantic features from UAV and satellite imagery through semantic weighting mechanism and optimized particle filtering architecture, using a new Multi-Altitude Flight Segments dataset.

Result: Achieves 10x computational efficiency gain over feature extraction methods, maintains global positioning errors below 10 meters, and enables rapid 4-DoF pose estimation within seconds using low-resolution satellite maps.

Conclusion: The SWA-PF method effectively overcomes limitations of existing retrieval-based approaches and provides robust, efficient UAV localization in GNSS-denied environments with strong generalization capability.

Abstract: Vision-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) localization systems have been
extensively investigated for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied
environments. However, existing retrieval-based approaches face limitations in
dataset availability and persistent challenges including suboptimal real-time
performance, environmental sensitivity, and limited generalization capability,
particularly in dynamic or temporally varying environments. To overcome these
limitations, we present a large-scale Multi-Altitude Flight Segments dataset

Adaptive Particle Filter (SWA-PF) method. This approach integrates robust
semantic features from both UAV-captured images and satellite imagery through
two key innovations: a semantic weighting mechanism and an optimized particle
filtering architecture. Evaluated using our dataset, the proposed method
achieves 10x computational efficiency gain over feature extraction methods,
maintains global positioning errors below 10 meters, and enables rapid 4 degree

TL;DR: VHBench-10 benchmark reveals visual encoders' distinct hallucination patterns in LVLMs. VisionWeaver routing network dynamically combines multiple visual experts to significantly reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models limits real-world use. Different visual encoders have distinct inductive biases from varied training, leading to diverse hallucination patterns that existing benchmarks fail to capture.

Method: Introduce VHBench-10 with ~10,000 samples across 10 fine-grained hallucination categories. Propose VisionWeaver - a Context-Aware Routing Network that uses global visual features to generate routing signals, dynamically aggregating features from multiple specialized experts.

Result: Evaluations confirm encoders exhibit unique hallucination characteristics. VisionWeaver significantly reduces hallucinations and improves overall model performance compared to simple feature fusion approaches.

Conclusion: Visual encoder choice is crucial for LVLM performance. Fine-grained hallucination analysis reveals encoder-specific biases. VisionWeaver's dynamic expert routing effectively mitigates hallucinations and enhances model capabilities.

Abstract: Object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) significantly
impedes their real-world applicability. As the primary component for accurately
interpreting visual information, the choice of visual encoder is pivotal. We
hypothesize that the diverse training paradigms employed by different visual
encoders instill them with distinct inductive biases, which leads to their
diverse hallucination performances. Existing benchmarks typically focus on
coarse-grained hallucination detection and fail to capture the diverse
hallucinations elaborated in our hypothesis. To systematically analyze these
effects, we introduce VHBench-10, a comprehensive benchmark with approximately
10,000 samples for evaluating LVLMs across ten fine-grained hallucination
categories. Our evaluations confirm encoders exhibit unique hallucination
characteristics. Building on these insights and the suboptimality of simple
feature fusion, we propose VisionWeaver, a novel Context-Aware Routing Network.
It employs global visual features to generate routing signals, dynamically
aggregating visual features from multiple specialized experts. Comprehensive
experiments confirm the effectiveness of VisionWeaver in significantly reducing
hallucinations and improving overall model performance.

TL;DR: Masked Feature Modeling (MFM) is a novel auxiliary task for unsupervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation that performs feature masking and reconstruction in feature space, achieving improved performance without inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing masked modeling approaches are underexplored in UDA for semantic segmentation due to architectural incompatibility and misaligned optimization objectives with contrastive learning methods.

Method: Proposes MFM that masks and reconstructs features directly in feature space using a lightweight Rebuilder module, leveraging the segmentation decoder to classify reconstructed features while maintaining compatibility with standard architectures.

Result: Extensive experiments show MFM consistently enhances segmentation performance across various architectures and UDA benchmarks without adding computational overhead during inference.

Conclusion: MFM provides a simple, efficient, and generalizable strategy for unsupervised domain-adaptive semantic segmentation that effectively couples auxiliary objectives with the primary prediction task.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation aims to
transfer models from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain.
While auxiliary self-supervised tasks-particularly contrastive learning-have
improved feature discriminability, masked modeling approaches remain
underexplored in this setting, largely due to architectural incompatibility and
misaligned optimization objectives. We propose Masked Feature Modeling (MFM), a
novel auxiliary task that performs feature masking and reconstruction directly
in the feature space. Unlike existing masked modeling methods that reconstruct
low-level inputs or perceptual features (e.g., HOG or visual tokens), MFM
aligns its learning target with the main segmentation task, ensuring
compatibility with standard architectures like DeepLab and DAFormer without
modifying the inference pipeline. To facilitate effective reconstruction, we
introduce a lightweight auxiliary module, Rebuilder, which is trained jointly
but discarded during inference, adding zero computational overhead at test
time. Crucially, MFM leverages the segmentation decoder to classify the
reconstructed features, tightly coupling the auxiliary objective with the
pixel-wise prediction task to avoid interference with the primary task.
Extensive experiments across various architectures and UDA benchmarks
demonstrate that MFM consistently enhances segmentation performance, offering a
simple, efficient, and generalizable strategy for unsupervised domain-adaptive
semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: MiniROCKET and HDC-MiniROCKET outperform 1D-Justo-LiuNet for spectral classification with limited training data, while performing similarly in general scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral classification is valuable for various applications, but current state-of-the-art model 1D-Justo-LiuNet performs poorly with limited training data, creating a need for more robust alternatives.

Method: Investigates MiniROCKET and HDC-MiniROCKET models that use well-engineered feature extraction without trainable parameters, making them less vulnerable to limited training data.

Result: MiniROCKET outperforms 1D-Justo-LiuNet in limited data scenarios and achieves comparable performance in general cases, despite having more parameters.

Conclusion: MiniROCKET-based approaches provide a more robust solution for spectral classification, particularly beneficial when training data is limited, while maintaining competitive performance in standard scenarios.

Abstract: The classification of pixel spectra of hyperspectral images, i.e. spectral
classification, is used in many fields ranging from agricultural, over medical
to remote sensing applications and is currently also expanding to areas such as
autonomous driving. Even though for full hyperspectral images the
best-performing methods exploit spatial-spectral information, performing
classification solely on spectral information has its own advantages, e.g.
smaller model size and thus less data required for training. Moreover, spectral
information is complementary to spatial information and improvements on either
part can be used to improve spatial-spectral approaches in the future.
Recently, 1D-Justo-LiuNet was proposed as a particularly efficient model with
very few parameters, which currently defines the state of the art in spectral
classification. However, we show that with limited training data the model
performance deteriorates. Therefore, we investigate MiniROCKET and
HDC-MiniROCKET for spectral classification to mitigate that problem. The model
extracts well-engineered features without trainable parameters in the feature
extraction part and is therefore less vulnerable to limited training data. We
show that even though MiniROCKET has more parameters it outperforms
1D-Justo-LiuNet in limited data scenarios and is mostly on par with it in the
general case

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRT enables efficient high-FPS video understanding by reducing tokenization overhead through motion compensation and semantic merging, outperforming existing VLLMs on dense temporal reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video LLMs use low-frame-rate sampling which discards dense temporal information needed for tasks requiring precise temporal alignment like lecture comprehension, while full-frame tokenization is computationally expensive.

Method: Gated Residual Tokenization (GRT) - a two-stage framework: 1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated Tokenization uses motion estimation to skip static regions, 2) Semantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static scenes to reduce redundancy.

Result: GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines on the DIVE benchmark and scales positively with FPS, demonstrating efficient high-FPS video understanding.

Conclusion: Dense temporal information is crucial for video understanding, and GRT provides an efficient, scalable solution for high-FPS video comprehension while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: High temporal resolution is essential for capturing fine-grained details in
video understanding. However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and
benchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or
keyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise
avoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to
redundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While
this trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like
lecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and
requires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense
Video Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by
reducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are
also limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore
propose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed
for dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual
Tokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated
Tokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during
tokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2)
Semantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions
within a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics.
Experiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales
positively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal
information and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video
understanding.

Features Multi-Gating Pseudo-labeling module for dynamic feature aggregation and Adaptive Multi-Objective Loss for automatic balancing of multiple learning objectives.

Result: Extensive experiments on GlaS and CRAG benchmarks show the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in low-label settings.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of MoE-based architectures in advancing semi-supervised segmentation for histopathology images, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has been employed to alleviate the need for
extensive labeled data for histopathology image segmentation, but existing
methods struggle with noisy pseudo-labels due to ambiguous gland boundaries and
morphological misclassification. This paper introduces Semi-MOE, to the best of
our knowledge, the first multi-task Mixture-of-Experts framework for

specialized expert networks: A main segmentation expert, a signed distance
field regression expert, and a boundary prediction expert, each dedicated to
capturing distinct morphological features. Subsequently, the Multi-Gating
Pseudo-labeling module dynamically aggregates expert features, enabling a
robust fuse-and-refine pseudo-labeling mechanism. Furthermore, to eliminate
manual tuning while dynamically balancing multiple learning objectives, we
propose an Adaptive Multi-Objective Loss. Extensive experiments on GlaS and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent representation learning methods assume uncorrelated views naturally produce meaningful representations, but the authors demonstrate this structure doesn't emerge naturally and must be explicitly induced.

Method: Proposes Consistent View Alignment method that aligns representations from different data views to capture complementary information while avoiding false positive alignments.

Result: The method achieved 1st and 2nd place in MICCAI 2025 SSL3D challenge using Primus vision transformer and ResEnc CNN respectively, showing improved downstream task performance.

Conclusion: Structured view alignment is critical for learning effective representations, and explicit induction of latent structure through proper alignment significantly improves self-supervised learning outcomes.

Abstract: Many recent approaches in representation learning implicitly assume that
uncorrelated views of a data point are sufficient to learn meaningful
representations for various downstream tasks. In this work, we challenge this
assumption and demonstrate that meaningful structure in the latent space does
not emerge naturally. Instead, it must be explicitly induced. We propose a
method that aligns representations from different views of the data to align
complementary information without inducing false positives. Our experiments
show that our proposed self-supervised learning method, Consistent View
Alignment, improves performance for downstream tasks, highlighting the critical
role of structured view alignment in learning effective representations. Our

semantics from a large vision-language teacher (e.g., LLaVa) into a lightweight
vision-only object detector student (e.g., YOLO). A translation module maps
student features into a joint space, where the training of the student and
translator is guided by a dual-objective loss that enforces both local
alignment and global relational consistency. Unlike prior approaches focused on
dense or global alignment, MOCHA operates at the object level, enabling
efficient transfer of semantics without modifying the teacher or requiring
textual input at inference. We validate our method across four personalized
detection benchmarks under few-shot regimes. Results show consistent gains over
baselines, with a +10.1 average score improvement. Despite its compact
architecture, MOCHA reaches performance on par with larger multimodal models,
proving its suitability for real-world deployment.

### [57] [SpecDiff: Accelerating Diffusion Model Inference with Self-Speculation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13848)
*Jiayi Pan,Jiaming Xu,Yongkang Zhou,Guohao Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecDiff is a training-free feature caching method for diffusion models that uses self-speculative future information and historical information to achieve significant speedups (2.7-3.2×) with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature caching methods rely solely on historical information, which limits both accuracy and speed performance. The authors aim to overcome the speedup-accuracy trade-off by incorporating future information through self-speculation.

Method: SpecDiff uses a multi-level feature caching strategy with: (1) a feature selection algorithm that calculates dynamic importance scores using self-speculative and historical information, and (2) a multi-level feature classification algorithm that categorizes tokens based on importance score differences and applies different calculation strategies.

Result: Achieves average 2.80×, 2.74×, and 3.17× speedup on Stable Diffusion 3, 3.5, and FLUX respectively with negligible quality loss compared to RFlow on NVIDIA A800-80GB GPU.

Conclusion: By combining speculative and historical information, SpecDiff breaks through the speedup-accuracy trade-off bottleneck and advances the Pareto frontier for efficient diffusion model inference.

Abstract: Feature caching has recently emerged as a promising method for diffusion
model acceleration. It effectively alleviates the inefficiency problem caused
by high computational requirements by caching similar features in the inference
process of the diffusion model. In this paper, we analyze existing feature
caching methods from the perspective of information utilization, and point out
that relying solely on historical information will lead to constrained accuracy
and speed performance. And we propose a novel paradigm that introduces future
information via self-speculation based on the information similarity at the
same time step across different iteration times. Based on this paradigm, we
present \textit{SpecDiff}, a training-free multi-level feature caching strategy
including a cached feature selection algorithm and a multi-level feature
classification algorithm. (1) Feature selection algorithm based on
self-speculative information. \textit{SpecDiff} determines a dynamic importance
score for each token based on self-speculative information and historical
information, and performs cached feature selection through the importance
score. (2) Multi-level feature classification algorithm based on feature
importance scores. \textit{SpecDiff} classifies tokens by leveraging the
differences in feature importance scores and introduces a multi-level feature
calculation strategy. Extensive experiments show that \textit{SpecDiff}
achieves average 2.80 \times, 2.74 \times , and 3.17\times speedup with
negligible quality loss in Stable Diffusion 3, 3.5, and FLUX compared to RFlow
on NVIDIA A800-80GB GPU. By merging speculative and historical information,
\textit{SpecDiff} overcomes the speedup-accuracy trade-off bottleneck, pushing
the Pareto frontier of speedup and accuracy in the efficient diffusion model
inference.

### [58] [EDITS: Enhancing Dataset Distillation with Implicit Textual Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13858)
*Qianxin Xia,Jiawei Du,Guoming Lu,Zhiyong Shu,Jielei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDITS is a novel dataset distillation framework that leverages textual semantics from vision-language models to enhance synthetic dataset quality, outperforming traditional methods that only capture low-level visual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dataset distillation methods primarily capture low-level visual features but neglect high-level semantic and structural information inherent in images, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: EDITS uses a Vision Language Model to generate external texts fused with image features, creates image and text prototypes through Local Semantic Awareness, and employs Dual Prototype Guidance with a diffusion model to generate the final synthetic dataset.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the method, showing improved performance over traditional techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed EDITS framework successfully exploits implicit textual semantics to achieve enhanced dataset distillation, preserving competitive model performance while enabling highly efficient learning.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a compact dataset from the original
large-scale one, enabling highly efficient learning while preserving
competitive model performance. However, traditional techniques primarily
capture low-level visual features, neglecting the high-level semantic and
structural information inherent in images. In this paper, we propose EDITS, a
novel framework that exploits the implicit textual semantics within the image
data to achieve enhanced distillation. First, external texts generated by a
Vision Language Model (VLM) are fused with image features through a Global
Semantic Query module, forming the prior clustered buffer. Local Semantic
Awareness then selects representative samples from the buffer to construct
image and text prototypes, with the latter produced by guiding a Large Language
Model (LLM) with meticulously crafted prompt. Ultimately, Dual Prototype
Guidance strategy generates the final synthetic dataset through a diffusion
model. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method.Source

### [59] [LamiGauss: Pitching Radiative Gaussian for Sparse-View X-ray Laminography Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13863)
*Chu Chen,Ander Biguri,Jean-Michel Morel,Raymond H. Chan,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb,Jizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LamiGauss is a novel X-ray laminography reconstruction algorithm that uses Gaussian Splatting with a specialized detector-to-world transformation to achieve high-quality 3D reconstructions from highly sparse-view projections (only 3% of full views).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CT struggles with plate-like structures due to geometric constraints, and existing laminography methods face challenges in reconstructing high-quality volumes from sparse projections, particularly with common laminographic artifacts.

Method: Combines Gaussian Splatting radiative rasterization with a dedicated detector-to-world transformation model incorporating laminographic tilt angle. Uses an initialization strategy that filters out laminographic artifacts from preliminary reconstruction to prevent redundant Gaussians and concentrate model capacity on genuine structures.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets show superior performance over existing techniques. Achieves better results with only 3% of full views compared to iterative methods optimized on full datasets.

Conclusion: LamiGauss enables accurate and efficient reconstruction directly from sparse projections, effectively addressing the challenges of laminographic reconstruction under highly sparse-view acquisition conditions.

Abstract: X-ray Computed Laminography (CL) is essential for non-destructive inspection
of plate-like structures in applications such as microchips and composite
battery materials, where traditional computed tomography (CT) struggles due to
geometric constraints. However, reconstructing high-quality volumes from
laminographic projections remains challenging, particularly under highly
sparse-view acquisition conditions. In this paper, we propose a reconstruction
algorithm, namely LamiGauss, that combines Gaussian Splatting radiative
rasterization with a dedicated detector-to-world transformation model
incorporating the laminographic tilt angle. LamiGauss leverages an
initialization strategy that explicitly filters out common laminographic
artifacts from the preliminary reconstruction, preventing redundant Gaussians
from being allocated to false structures and thereby concentrating model
capacity on representing the genuine object. Our approach effectively optimizes
directly from sparse projections, enabling accurate and efficient
reconstruction with limited data. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed
method over existing techniques. LamiGauss uses only 3$\%$ of full views to
achieve superior performance over the iterative method optimized on a full
dataset.

*Jovana Videnovic,Matej Kristan,Alan Lukezic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAM4SAM enhances SAM2 with distractor-aware memory and introspection management to improve tracking performance against visually similar objects, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory-based video segmentation methods like SAM2 perform well on segmentation tasks but are not optimized for visual object tracking where distractors (visually similar objects) cause tracking drift and poor redetection after occlusion.

Method: Proposes a distractor-aware drop-in memory module and introspection-based management method for SAM2, creating DAM4SAM. Also constructs DiDi dataset for distractor analysis.

Result: Outperforms SAM2.1 on 13 benchmarks, sets new SOTA on 10. Integration with EfficientTAM yields 11% improvement, matches non-real-time SAM2.1-L performance. EdgeTAM integration shows 4% boost with good generalization.

Conclusion: The distractor-aware memory module effectively addresses tracking challenges with distractors, demonstrating strong performance improvements and generalization across different tracker architectures.

Abstract: Recent emergence of memory-based video segmentation methods such as SAM2 has
led to models with excellent performance in segmentation tasks, achieving
leading results on numerous benchmarks. However, these modes are not fully
adjusted for visual object tracking, where distractors (i.e., objects visually
similar to the target) pose a key challenge. In this paper we propose a
distractor-aware drop-in memory module and introspection-based management
method for SAM2, leading to DAM4SAM. Our design effectively reduces the
tracking drift toward distractors and improves redetection capability after
object occlusion. To facilitate the analysis of tracking in the presence of
distractors, we construct DiDi, a Distractor-Distilled dataset. DAM4SAM
outperforms SAM2.1 on thirteen benchmarks and sets new state-of-the-art results
on ten. Furthermore, integrating the proposed distractor-aware memory into a
real-time tracker EfficientTAM leads to 11% improvement and matches tracking
quality of the non-real-time SAM2.1-L on multiple tracking and segmentation
benchmarks, while integration with edge-based tracker EdgeTAM delivers 4%
performance boost, demonstrating a very good generalization across
architectures.

*Michal Szczepanski,Martyna Poreba,Karim Haroun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STEP is a hybrid token-reduction framework that combines dynamic patch merging and early token pruning to significantly improve Vision Transformer efficiency for semantic segmentation with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers achieve state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation but suffer from high computational and memory costs, creating a need for more efficient approaches.

Method: Proposes STEP framework with dCTS (lightweight CNN-based policy network) for dynamic patch merging into superpatches, and integrates early-exits in encoder blocks to remove high-confident tokens, reducing computational load.

Result: dCTS alone reduces token count by 2.5x, yielding 2.6x computational cost reduction and 3.4x throughput increase. Full STEP framework achieves up to 4x computational complexity reduction and 1.7x inference speed gain with max 2.0% accuracy drop. Up to 40% of tokens can be halted early.

Conclusion: STEP effectively addresses ViT efficiency issues in semantic segmentation through hybrid token reduction, maintaining high accuracy while significantly improving computational performance and throughput.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in semantic
segmentation but are hindered by high computational and memory costs. To
address this, we propose STEP (SuperToken and Early-Pruning), a hybrid
token-reduction framework that combines dynamic patch merging and token pruning
to enhance efficiency without significantly compromising accuracy. At the core
of STEP is dCTS, a lightweight CNN-based policy network that enables flexible
merging into superpatches. Encoder blocks integrate also early-exits to remove
high-confident supertokens, lowering computational load. We evaluate our method
on high-resolution semantic segmentation benchmarks, including images up to
1024 x 1024, and show that when dCTS is applied alone, the token count can be
reduced by a factor of 2.5 compared to the standard 16 x 16 pixel patching
scheme. This yields a 2.6x reduction in computational cost and a 3.4x increase
in throughput when using ViT-Large as the backbone. Applying the full STEP
framework further improves efficiency, reaching up to a 4x reduction in
computational complexity and a 1.7x gain in inference speed, with a maximum
accuracy drop of no more than 2.0%. With the proposed STEP configurations, up
to 40% of tokens can be confidently predicted and halted before reaching the
final encoder layer.

*Siam Tahsin Bhuiyan,Rashedur Rahman,Sefatul Wasi,Naomi Yagi,Syoji Kobashi,Ashraful Islam,Saadia Binte Alam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PelFANet is a dual-stream attention network that fuses raw pelvic X-rays with segmented bone images to improve fracture classification, achieving high accuracy on both visible and invisible fractures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pelvic fractures are difficult to diagnose when fracture signs are subtle or invisible on standard radiographs, requiring improved detection methods.

Method: Dual-stream attention network with Fused Attention Blocks (FABlocks) that iteratively exchange features from raw X-rays and segmented bone images, trained in a two-stage pipeline with segmentation guidance.

Result: 88.68% accuracy and 0.9334 AUC on visible fractures, and 82.29% accuracy and 0.8688 AUC on invisible fractures despite no training on them.

Conclusion: Anatomy-aware dual-input architectures like PelFANet show strong clinical potential for robust fracture detection, especially in cases with subtle radiographic presentations.

Abstract: Pelvic fractures pose significant diagnostic challenges, particularly in
cases where fracture signs are subtle or invisible on standard radiographs. To
address this, we introduce PelFANet, a dual-stream attention network that fuses
raw pelvic X-rays with segmented bone images to improve fracture
classification. The network em-ploys Fused Attention Blocks (FABlocks) to
iteratively exchange and refine fea-tures from both inputs, capturing global
context and localized anatomical detail. Trained in a two-stage pipeline with a
segmentation-guided approach, PelFANet demonstrates superior performance over
conventional methods. On the AMERI dataset, it achieves 88.68% accuracy and
0.9334 AUC on visible fractures, while generalizing effectively to invisible
fracture cases with 82.29% accuracy and 0.8688 AUC, despite not being trained
on them. These results highlight the clini-cal potential of anatomy-aware
dual-input architectures for robust fracture detec-tion, especially in
scenarios with subtle radiographic presentations.

*Zhen Xu,Guorui Lu,Chang Gao,Qinyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvHand-FPV is a lightweight framework for egocentric 3D hand tracking using a single event camera, achieving 89% reduction in parameters and FLOPs while improving accuracy for XR applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frame-based hand tracking methods struggle with accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency in resource-constrained XR devices. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution with low power consumption but lack egocentric benchmarks.

Method: Uses wrist-based ROI localization with geometric cues, end-to-end mapping with embedded ROI offsets to reduce computation, and multi-task learning with auxiliary geometric feature head. Combines synthetic 3D training data with real 2D evaluation data.

Result: Achieves 2D-AUCp improvement from 0.77 to 0.85, reduces parameters by 89% (11.2M to 1.2M) and FLOPs by 89% (1.648G to 0.185G) per inference. Maintains competitive 3D-AUCp of 0.84 on synthetic data.

Conclusion: Demonstrates accurate and efficient egocentric event-based hand tracking suitable for on-device XR applications, with publicly available dataset and code.

Abstract: Hand tracking holds great promise for intuitive interaction paradigms, but
frame-based methods often struggle to meet the requirements of accuracy, low
latency, and energy efficiency, especially in resource-constrained settings
such as Extended Reality (XR) devices. Event cameras provide $\mu$s-level
temporal resolution at mW-level power by asynchronously sensing brightness
changes. In this work, we present EvHand-FPV, a lightweight framework for
egocentric First-Person-View 3D hand tracking from a single event camera. We
construct an event-based FPV dataset that couples synthetic training data with
3D labels and real event data with 2D labels for evaluation to address the
scarcity of egocentric benchmarks. EvHand-FPV also introduces a wrist-based
region of interest (ROI) that localizes the hand region via geometric cues,
combined with an end-to-end mapping strategy that embeds ROI offsets into the
network to reduce computation without explicit reconstruction, and a multi-task
learning strategy with an auxiliary geometric feature head that improves
representations without test-time overhead. On our real FPV test set,
EvHand-FPV improves 2D-AUCp from 0.77 to 0.85 while reducing parameters from
11.2M to 1.2M by 89% and FLOPs per inference from 1.648G to 0.185G by 89%. It
also maintains a competitive 3D-AUCp of 0.84 on synthetic data. These results
demonstrate accurate and efficient egocentric event-based hand tracking
suitable for on-device XR applications. The dataset and code are available at

*Jiyun Im,SuBeen Lee,Miso Lee,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes WARM, a whitening-coloring attention module for few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation that addresses distribution gaps between prototypical tokens and support features to generate better prototypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype generation methods for few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation suffer from randomness in farthest point sampling and underexplored prototype generation processes, while vanilla attention modules face distributional gaps between learnable tokens and support features.

Method: White Aggregation and Restoration Module (WARM) that sandwiches cross-attention between whitening and coloring transformations - whitening aligns support features to prototypical tokens before attention, then coloring restores the original distribution to attended tokens.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant margin on multiple few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation benchmarks through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: WARM's simple yet effective design enables robust attention and generates representative prototypes by capturing semantic relationships among support features, demonstrating effectiveness for few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation.

Abstract: Few-Shot 3D Point Cloud Segmentation (FS-PCS) aims to predict per-point
labels for an unlabeled point cloud, given only a few labeled examples. To
extract discriminative representations from the limited support set, existing
methods have constructed prototypes using conventional algorithms such as
farthest point sampling. However, we point out that its initial randomness
significantly affects FS-PCS performance and that the prototype generation
process remains underexplored despite its prevalence. This motivates us to
investigate an advanced prototype generation method based on attention
mechanism. Despite its potential, we found that vanilla module suffers from the
distributional gap between learnable prototypical tokens and support features.
To overcome this, we propose White Aggregation and Restoration Module (WARM),
which resolves the misalignment by sandwiching cross-attention between
whitening and coloring transformations. Specifically, whitening aligns the
support features to prototypical tokens before attention process, and
subsequently coloring restores the original distribution to the attended
tokens. This simple yet effective design enables robust attention, thereby
generating representative prototypes by capturing the semantic relationships
among support features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a
significant margin on multiple FS-PCS benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness through extensive experiments.

*Yuanchen Wu,Ke Yan,Shouhong Ding,Ziyin Zhou,Xiaoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRC framework improves LVLMs by iteratively calibrating rationale-answer alignment through rationale fine-tuning, candidate generation, pairwise scoring, and preference fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs struggle with aligning rationales and answers, leading to inconsistent reasoning and incorrect responses despite strong visual question answering capabilities.

Method: Self-Rationale Calibration (SRC) framework: 1) Rationale fine-tuning to require rationale before answer, 2) Generate diverse candidate responses, 3) Pairwise scoring with R-Scorer model, 4) Confidence-weighted preference curation for fine-tuning.

Result: Significant improvements in perception, reasoning, and generalization across multiple benchmarks for LVLMs.

Conclusion: Rationale-oriented alignment is crucial for exploring LVLMs' potential, and SRC effectively addresses rationale-answer misalignment issues.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have manifested strong visual question
answering capability. However, they still struggle with aligning the rationale
and the generated answer, leading to inconsistent reasoning and incorrect
responses. To this end, this paper introduces the Self-Rationale Calibration
(SRC) framework to iteratively calibrate the alignment between rationales and
answers. SRC begins by employing a lightweight "rationale fine-tuning"
approach, which modifies the model's response format to require a rationale
before deriving an answer without explicit prompts. Next, SRC searches for a
diverse set of candidate responses from the fine-tuned LVLMs for each sample,
followed by a proposed pairwise scoring strategy using a tailored scoring
model, R-Scorer, to evaluate both rationale quality and factual consistency of
candidates. Based on a confidence-weighted preference curation process, SRC
decouples the alignment calibration into a preference fine-tuning manner,
leading to significant improvements of LVLMs in perception, reasoning, and
generalization across multiple benchmarks. Our results emphasize the
rationale-oriented alignment in exploring the potential of LVLMs.

### [66] [Towards Robust Defense against Customization via Protective Perturbation Resistant to Diffusion-based Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13922)
*Wenkui Yang,Jie Cao,Junxian Duan,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AntiPure is a protective perturbation method that resists purification attacks in diffusion models, using frequency and timestep guidance to maintain adversarial noise through purification processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing protective perturbation methods for preventing image misuse in diffusion models can be defeated by purification techniques, leaving images vulnerable to malicious forgery despite initial protection.

Method: AntiPure uses two guidance mechanisms: Patch-wise Frequency Guidance to reduce model influence over high-frequency components, and Erroneous Timestep Guidance to disrupt denoising strategies across timesteps, embedding persistent imperceptible perturbations.

Result: AntiPure achieves minimal perceptual discrepancy and maximal distortion in post-customization scenarios, outperforming other protective perturbation methods under representative purification settings.

Conclusion: AntiPure effectively addresses anti-purification challenges in diffusion models, providing robust protection against image misuse even when purification techniques are employed.

Abstract: Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion have become prominent in visual
synthesis tasks due to their powerful customization capabilities, which also
introduce significant security risks, including deepfakes and copyright
infringement. In response, a class of methods known as protective perturbation
emerged, which mitigates image misuse by injecting imperceptible adversarial
noise. However, purification can remove protective perturbations, thereby
exposing images again to the risk of malicious forgery. In this work, we
formalize the anti-purification task, highlighting challenges that hinder
existing approaches, and propose a simple diagnostic protective perturbation
named AntiPure. AntiPure exposes vulnerabilities of purification within the
"purification-customization" workflow, owing to two guidance mechanisms: 1)
Patch-wise Frequency Guidance, which reduces the model's influence over
high-frequency components in the purified image, and 2) Erroneous Timestep
Guidance, which disrupts the model's denoising strategy across different
timesteps. With additional guidance, AntiPure embeds imperceptible
perturbations that persist under representative purification settings,
achieving effective post-customization distortion. Experiments show that, as a
stress test for purification, AntiPure achieves minimal perceptual discrepancy
and maximal distortion, outperforming other protective perturbation methods
within the purification-customization workflow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random Gaussian noise used to start diffusion processes causes variations in output quality and prompt adherence. Existing optimization approaches are impractical due to requirements for extra datasets, additional networks, or complex optimization.

Method: Proposes Noise Level Guidance (NLG) that refines initial noise by increasing its alignment with general guidance. Works without additional training data, auxiliary networks, or backpropagation. Provides a unified framework for both conditional and unconditional diffusion models.

Result: Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks demonstrate enhanced output generation quality and improved input condition adherence. The method integrates seamlessly with existing guidance methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: NLG establishes itself as a practical and scalable enhancement to diffusion models, offering a simple yet effective solution to noise-level optimization that works across various diffusion models and guidance types.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art image generation. However,
the random Gaussian noise used to start the diffusion process influences the
final output, causing variations in image quality and prompt adherence.
Existing noise-level optimization approaches generally rely on extra dataset
construction, additional networks, or backpropagation-based optimization,
limiting their practicality. In this paper, we propose Noise Level Guidance
(NLG), a simple, efficient, and general noise-level optimization approach that
refines initial noise by increasing the likelihood of its alignment with
general guidance - requiring no additional training data, auxiliary networks,
or backpropagation. The proposed NLG approach provides a unified framework
generalizable to both conditional and unconditional diffusion models,
accommodating various forms of diffusion-level guidance. Extensive experiments
on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach enhances output
generation quality and input condition adherence. By seamlessly integrating
with existing guidance methods while maintaining computational efficiency, our
method establishes NLG as a practical and scalable enhancement to diffusion
models. Code can be found at

TL;DR: PairTally is a new benchmark dataset for evaluating fine-grained visual counting, showing current models struggle with intent-driven counting in complex scenes with subtle object differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counting models lack the ability to perform fine-grained, intent-driven counting in complex scenes where objects have subtle differences in shape, size, color, or semantics.

Method: Created PairTally dataset with 681 high-resolution images containing two object categories each, including both inter-category and intra-category settings. Benchmarked various state-of-the-art models including exemplar-based methods, language-prompted models, and large VLMs.

Result: Current models struggle to reliably count what users intend, especially in fine-grained and visually ambiguous cases, despite recent advances in counting technology.

Conclusion: PairTally provides a foundation for diagnosing and improving fine-grained visual counting systems, highlighting the need for better intent-driven counting capabilities in complex visual scenarios.

Abstract: Visual counting is a fundamental yet challenging task, especially when users
need to count objects of a specific type in complex scenes. While recent
models, including class-agnostic counting models and large vision-language
models (VLMs), show promise in counting tasks, their ability to perform
fine-grained, intent-driven counting remains unclear. In this paper, we
introduce PairTally, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate
fine-grained visual counting. Each of the 681 high-resolution images in
PairTally contains two object categories, requiring models to distinguish and
count based on subtle differences in shape, size, color, or semantics. The
dataset includes both inter-category (distinct categories) and intra-category
(closely related subcategories) settings, making it suitable for rigorous
evaluation of selective counting capabilities. We benchmark a variety of
state-of-the-art models, including exemplar-based methods, language-prompted
models, and large VLMs. Our results show that despite recent advances, current
models struggle to reliably count what users intend, especially in fine-grained
and visually ambiguous cases. PairTally provides a new foundation for
diagnosing and improving fine-grained visual counting systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Enhanced YOLO-FEDER FusionNet for drone detection in complex environments, combining object detection with camouflage detection techniques, achieving significant performance improvements with up to 39.1% FNR reduction and 62.8% mAP increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drone detection in visually complex environments is challenging due to background clutter, small object scale, and camouflage effects. Generic object detectors like YOLO perform poorly in cluttered environments with low object-background separability.

Method: Enhanced YOLO-FEDER FusionNet framework integrating generic object detection with camouflage detection techniques. Improvements include systematic advancements in training data composition (large-scale synthetic data + real-world samples), feature fusion strategies, and backbone design. Evaluated intermediate multi-scale FEDER features and multiple YOLO-based backbone configurations.

Result: Significant performance improvements achieved. Best configuration (YOLOv8l backbone with FEDER features from DWD module) showed up to 39.1 percentage points FNR reduction and up to 62.8 percentage points mAP increase at IoU threshold of 0.5 compared to baseline.

Conclusion: Integrating intermediate FEDER features with backbone upgrades in YOLO-FEDER FusionNet framework effectively addresses drone detection challenges in complex environments, demonstrating substantial performance gains over conventional approaches.

Abstract: Drone detection in visually complex environments remains challenging due to
background clutter, small object scale, and camouflage effects. While generic
object detectors like YOLO exhibit strong performance in low-texture scenes,
their effectiveness degrades in cluttered environments with low
object-background separability. To address these limitations, this work
presents an enhanced iteration of YOLO-FEDER FusionNet -- a detection framework
that integrates generic object detection with camouflage object detection
techniques. Building upon the original architecture, the proposed iteration
introduces systematic advancements in training data composition, feature fusion
strategies, and backbone design. Specifically, the training process leverages
large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic data, complemented by a small set of
real-world samples, to enhance robustness under visually complex conditions.
The contribution of intermediate multi-scale FEDER features is systematically
evaluated, and detection performance is comprehensively benchmarked across
multiple YOLO-based backbone configurations. Empirical results indicate that
integrating intermediate FEDER features, in combination with backbone upgrades,
contributes to notable performance improvements. In the most promising
configuration -- YOLO-FEDER FusionNet with a YOLOv8l backbone and FEDER
features derived from the DWD module -- these enhancements lead to a FNR
reduction of up to 39.1 percentage points and a mAP increase of up to 62.8
percentage points at an IoU threshold of 0.5, compared to the initial baseline.

TL;DR: PROFUSEme is a multi-modal AI system that predicts biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer patients by fusing clinical, radiology, and pathology data using intermediate fusion with Cox models, achieving superior performance over late fusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 30% of prostate cancer patients experience biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy, leading to increased mortality. Early accurate prediction at surgery time would enable better clinical decisions and improved patient outcomes.

Method: Intermediate fusion of clinical, radiology, and pathology data using cross-modal interactions combined with Cox Proportional Hazard regressors (PROFUSEme approach).

Result: Achieved mean C-index of 0.861 (σ=0.112) on internal 5-fold nested cross-validation, and C-index of 0.7103 on CHIMERA 2025 challenge validation leaderboard holdout data, outperforming late fusion configurations.

Conclusion: PROFUSEme demonstrates superior performance in predicting biochemical recurrence through effective multi-modal data fusion, providing a valuable tool for early clinical decision-making in prostate cancer management.

Abstract: Almost 30% of prostate cancer (PCa) patients undergoing radical prostatectomy
(RP) experience biochemical recurrence (BCR), characterized by increased
prostate specific antigen (PSA) and associated with increased mortality.
Accurate early prediction of BCR, at the time of RP, would contribute to prompt
adaptive clinical decision-making and improved patient outcomes. In this work,
we propose prostate cancer BCR prediction via fused multi-modal embeddings
(PROFUSEme), which learns cross-modal interactions of clinical, radiology, and
pathology data, following an intermediate fusion configuration in combination
with Cox Proportional Hazard regressors. Quantitative evaluation of our
proposed approach reveals superior performance, when compared with late fusion
configurations, yielding a mean C-index of 0.861 ($\sigma=0.112$) on the
internal 5-fold nested cross-validation framework, and a C-index of 0.7103 on

TL;DR: Wan-Animate is a unified framework for character animation and replacement that can animate characters from reference videos or replace characters in videos while maintaining environmental lighting consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified system that can both animate characters by replicating expressions/movements from reference videos and seamlessly replace characters in videos while preserving environmental lighting and color tones.

Method: Built on the Wan model with modified input paradigm using spatially-aligned skeleton signals for body motion and implicit facial features for expressions. Includes auxiliary Relighting LoRA for environmental integration during character replacement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-fidelity character videos with high controllability and expressiveness, while enabling seamless environmental integration.

Conclusion: Wan-Animate provides a comprehensive solution for character animation and replacement tasks with open-source commitment for model weights and source code.

Abstract: We introduce Wan-Animate, a unified framework for character animation and
replacement. Given a character image and a reference video, Wan-Animate can
animate the character by precisely replicating the expressions and movements of
the character in the video to generate high-fidelity character videos.
Alternatively, it can integrate the animated character into the reference video
to replace the original character, replicating the scene's lighting and color
tone to achieve seamless environmental integration. Wan-Animate is built upon
the Wan model. To adapt it for character animation tasks, we employ a modified
input paradigm to differentiate between reference conditions and regions for
generation. This design unifies multiple tasks into a common symbolic
representation. We use spatially-aligned skeleton signals to replicate body
motion and implicit facial features extracted from source images to reenact
expressions, enabling the generation of character videos with high
controllability and expressiveness. Furthermore, to enhance environmental
integration during character replacement, we develop an auxiliary Relighting
LoRA. This module preserves the character's appearance consistency while
applying the appropriate environmental lighting and color tone. Experimental
results demonstrate that Wan-Animate achieves state-of-the-art performance. We
are committed to open-sourcing the model weights and its source code.

*Jun Du,Weiwei Xing,Ming Li,Fei Richard Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSE-MOT framework uses vision-language models to enhance multi-object tracking in low-quality videos by extracting and fusing global visual semantic information, achieving 8-20% performance improvement over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MOT algorithms perform poorly in real-world low-quality video scenarios with image deterioration, limiting their practical application. There's a need to address tracking degradation in challenging visual conditions.

Method: Proposes a tri-branch architecture using vision-language models to extract global visual semantic information. Includes MOT-Adapter to adapt semantic information for tracking tasks and Visual Semantic Fusion Module (VSFM) to improve feature fusion effectiveness.

Result: The method achieves 8% to 20% performance improvement over existing methods in low-quality video scenarios while maintaining robust performance in conventional scenarios.

Conclusion: VSE-MOT framework successfully addresses MOT challenges in low-quality videos through visual semantic enhancement, demonstrating significant performance gains and practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Current multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms typically overlook issues
inherent in low-quality videos, leading to significant degradation in tracking
performance when confronted with real-world image deterioration. Therefore,
advancing the application of MOT algorithms in real-world low-quality video
scenarios represents a critical and meaningful endeavor. To address the
challenges posed by low-quality scenarios, inspired by vision-language models,
this paper proposes a Visual Semantic Enhancement-guided Multi-Object Tracking
framework (VSE-MOT). Specifically, we first design a tri-branch architecture
that leverages a vision-language model to extract global visual semantic
information from images and fuse it with query vectors. Subsequently, to
further enhance the utilization of visual semantic information, we introduce
the Multi-Object Tracking Adapter (MOT-Adapter) and the Visual Semantic Fusion
Module (VSFM). The MOT-Adapter adapts the extracted global visual semantic
information to suit multi-object tracking tasks, while the VSFM improves the
efficacy of feature fusion. Through extensive experiments, we validate the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in real-world low-quality
video scenarios. Its tracking performance metrics outperform those of existing
methods by approximately 8% to 20%, while maintaining robust performance in
conventional scenarios.

### [74] [AD-DINOv3: Enhancing DINOv3 for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection with Anomaly-Aware Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14084)
*Jingyi Yuan,Jianxiong Ye,Wenkang Chen,Chenqiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AD-DINOv3 is a novel vision-language framework that adapts DINOv3 for zero-shot anomaly detection, using lightweight adapters and an anomaly-aware calibration module to overcome domain bias and improve detection of subtle anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional zero-shot anomaly detection methods rely on CLIP, but vision foundation models like DINOv3 offer strong transferable representations. However, adapting DINOv3 for anomaly detection faces challenges with domain bias and global semantic bias that can miss subtle anomalies.

Method: The framework uses DINOv3 as visual backbone to extract patch and CLS tokens, with CLIP text encoder for normal/abnormal prompts. Lightweight adapters bridge domain gaps, and an Anomaly-Aware Calibration Module guides the CLS token to focus on anomalous regions rather than generic foreground semantics.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight industrial and medical benchmarks show that AD-DINOv3 consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: AD-DINOv3 demonstrates superiority as a general zero-shot anomaly detection framework, effectively overcoming domain bias and improving detection of subtle anomalies through multimodal contrastive learning and specialized calibration.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) seeks to identify anomalies from arbitrary
novel categories, offering a scalable and annotation-efficient solution.
Traditionally, most ZSAD works have been based on the CLIP model, which
performs anomaly detection by calculating the similarity between visual and
text embeddings. Recently, vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have
demonstrated strong transferable representation capabilities. In this work, we
are the first to adapt DINOv3 for ZSAD. However, this adaptation presents two
key challenges: (i) the domain bias between large-scale pretraining data and
anomaly detection tasks leads to feature misalignment; and (ii) the inherent
bias toward global semantics in pretrained representations often leads to
subtle anomalies being misinterpreted as part of the normal foreground objects,
rather than being distinguished as abnormal regions. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce AD-DINOv3, a novel vision-language multimodal
framework designed for ZSAD. Specifically, we formulate anomaly detection as a
multimodal contrastive learning problem, where DINOv3 is employed as the visual
backbone to extract patch tokens and a CLS token, and the CLIP text encoder
provides embeddings for both normal and abnormal prompts. To bridge the domain
gap, lightweight adapters are introduced in both modalities, enabling their
representations to be recalibrated for the anomaly detection task. Beyond this
baseline alignment, we further design an Anomaly-Aware Calibration Module
(AACM), which explicitly guides the CLS token to attend to anomalous regions
rather than generic foreground semantics, thereby enhancing discriminability.
Extensive experiments on eight industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate
that AD-DINOv3 consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
verifying its superiority as a general zero-shot anomaly detection framework.

*Yaru Chen,Ruohao Guo,Liting Gao,Yang Xiang,Qingyu Luo,Zhenbo Li,Wenwu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes EMA-guided pseudo supervision and class-aware cross-modal alignment for weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods neglected stable segment-level supervision and class-aware cross-modal alignment in weakly-supervised AVVP tasks.

Method: Two strategies: (1) EMA-guided pseudo supervision framework generating reliable segment-level masks via adaptive thresholds or top-k selection, (2) class-aware cross-modal agreement loss aligning audio and visual embeddings at reliable segment-class pairs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on LLP and UnAV-100 datasets across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address limitations in segment-level supervision and cross-modal alignment for weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing.

Abstract: Weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) seeks to detect audible,
visible, and audio-visual events without temporal annotations. Previous work
has emphasized refining global predictions through contrastive or collaborative
learning, but neglected stable segment-level supervision and class-aware
cross-modal alignment. To address this, we propose two strategies: (1) an
exponential moving average (EMA)-guided pseudo supervision framework that
generates reliable segment-level masks via adaptive thresholds or top-k
selection, offering stable temporal guidance beyond video-level labels; and (2)
a class-aware cross-modal agreement (CMA) loss that aligns audio and visual
embeddings at reliable segment-class pairs, ensuring consistency across
modalities while preserving temporal structure. Evaluations on LLP and UnAV-100
datasets shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
across multiple metrics.

TL;DR: Proposes CSMoE model integrating Soft Mixture-of-Experts into remote sensing foundation models to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance across scene classification, segmentation, and image retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote sensing foundation models suffer from high computational complexity during training/inference or limited representational capacity, restricting practical applicability.

Method: Integrates Soft MoE mechanism into Cross-Sensor Masked Autoencoder (CSMAE) to create CSMoE, enabling modality-specific expert specialization with cross-sensor representation learning. Uses thematic-climatic descriptor-driven sampling for diverse training set.

Result: CSMoE achieves more than twice the computational efficiency of existing RS FMs while maintaining competitive performance across all experiments (scene classification, semantic segmentation, content-based image retrieval).

Conclusion: The Soft MoE integration effectively creates computationally efficient remote sensing foundation models with superior trade-off between representational capacity, accuracy, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning through masked autoencoders has attracted great
attention for remote sensing (RS) foundation model (FM) development, enabling
improved representation learning across diverse sensors and downstream tasks.
However, existing RS FMs often either suffer from substantial computational
complexity during both training and inference or exhibit limited
representational capacity. These issues restrict their practical applicability
in RS. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptation for enhancing the
efficiency of RS FMs by integrating the Soft mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism
into the FM. The integration of Soft MoEs into the FM allows modality-specific
expert specialization alongside shared cross-sensor representation learning. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptation, we apply it on the
Cross-Sensor Masked Autoencoder (CSMAE) model, resulting in the Cross-Sensor
Mixture-of-Experts (CSMoE) model. In addition, we introduce a thematic-climatic
descriptor-driven sampling strategy for the construction of a representative
and diverse training set to train our CSMoE model. Extensive experiments on
scene classification, semantic segmentation, and content-based image retrieval
demonstrate that our adaptation yields a reduction in computational
requirements while maintaining or improving representational performance.
Compared to state-of-the-art RS FMs, CSMoE achieves a superior trade-off
between representational capacity, accuracy, and computational efficiency. On
average, CSMoE achieves more than twice the computational efficiency of
existing RS FMs, while maintaining competitive performance across all
experiments. These results show the effectiveness of the proposed adaptation
for creating computationally efficient RS FMs. The code for the model, the
training set creation, and the model weights will be available at

TL;DR: A robust virtual staining framework with cascaded registration mechanisms that addresses spatial mismatches in unpaired/roughly paired histopathology data, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional histopathological diagnosis requires multiple chemical stains that are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and environmentally taxing. Existing virtual staining methods struggle with clinical applications due to reliance on well-aligned paired data, which is difficult to obtain because chemical staining processes distort tissues and single sections cannot undergo multiple staining procedures.

Method: Proposed a robust virtual staining framework featuring cascaded registration mechanisms to resolve spatial mismatches between generated outputs and their corresponding ground truth in unpaired or roughly paired datasets.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across five datasets, with average improvements of 3.2% on internal datasets and 10.1% on external datasets. Achieves remarkable 23.8% improvement in PSNR on datasets with substantial misalignment compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates exceptional robustness across diverse datasets, simplifies data acquisition for virtual staining, and offers new insights for advancing virtual staining development in clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate histopathological diagnosis often requires multiple differently
stained tissue sections, a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
environmentally taxing due to the use of multiple chemical stains. Recently,
virtual staining has emerged as a promising alternative that is faster,
tissue-conserving, and environmentally friendly. However, existing virtual
staining methods face significant challenges in clinical applications,
primarily due to their reliance on well-aligned paired data. Obtaining such
data is inherently difficult because chemical staining processes can distort
tissue structures, and a single tissue section cannot undergo multiple staining
procedures without damage or loss of information. As a result, most available
virtual staining datasets are either unpaired or roughly paired, making it
difficult for existing methods to achieve accurate pixel-level supervision. To
address this challenge, we propose a robust virtual staining framework
featuring cascaded registration mechanisms to resolve spatial mismatches
between generated outputs and their corresponding ground truth. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
models across five datasets, achieving an average improvement of 3.2% on
internal datasets and 10.1% on external datasets. Moreover, in datasets with
substantial misalignment, our approach achieves a remarkable 23.8% improvement
in peak signal-to-noise ratio compared to baseline models. The exceptional
robustness of the proposed method across diverse datasets simplifies the data
acquisition process for virtual staining and offers new insights for advancing
its development.

*Haotian Li,Jianbo Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates why abstract images made of primitive shapes underperform compared to raster images in deep learning, introduces a hierarchical abstraction dataset (HAID), and evaluates vision systems across multiple tasks to understand semantic information capture at different abstraction levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies show abstract images constructed from primitive shapes can convey visual semantic information to deep learning models, but their representations fall short compared to traditional raster images. The paper aims to understand this performance gap and determine how much high-level semantic content can be captured at different abstraction levels.

Method: The authors introduce the Hierarchical Abstraction Image Dataset (HAID) containing abstract images generated from normal raster images at multiple abstraction levels. They train and evaluate conventional vision systems on HAID across classification, segmentation, and object detection tasks to compare rasterized and abstract image representations.

Result: The study provides a comprehensive comparison between rasterized and abstract image representations across multiple computer vision tasks, though specific quantitative results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The paper discusses whether abstract images can be considered as an effective format for conveying visual semantic information and contributing to vision tasks, providing insights into the capabilities and limitations of shape-based abstractions in computer vision systems.

Abstract: Imagine living in a world composed solely of primitive shapes, could you
still recognise familiar objects? Recent studies have shown that abstract
images-constructed by primitive shapes-can indeed convey visual semantic
information to deep learning models. However, representations obtained from
such images often fall short compared to those derived from traditional raster
images. In this paper, we study the reasons behind this performance gap and
investigate how much high-level semantic content can be captured at different
abstraction levels. To this end, we introduce the Hierarchical Abstraction
Image Dataset (HAID), a novel data collection that comprises abstract images
generated from normal raster images at multiple levels of abstraction. We then
train and evaluate conventional vision systems on HAID across various tasks
including classification, segmentation, and object detection, providing a
comprehensive study between rasterised and abstract image representations. We
also discuss if the abstract image can be considered as a potentially effective
format for conveying visual semantic information and contributing to vision
tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEVUDA++ is a geometric-aware teacher-student framework that addresses domain adaptation in multi-view 3D object detection for Bird's Eye View perception, using uncertainty-guided depth estimation and geometric consistency to reduce performance degradation in cross-domain scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift in real-world cross-domain scenarios causes substantial performance degradation in BEV perception for autonomous driving, and existing approaches have overlooked this issue while focusing only on efficiency or accuracy enhancements.

Method: Proposes BEVUDA++ with Reliable Depth Teacher (RDT) that blends target LiDAR with depth predictions using uncertainty estimation, and Geometric Consistent Student (GCS) that maps multi-space features into unified geometric embedding space. Also introduces Uncertainty-guided Exponential Moving Average (UEMA) to reduce error accumulation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in four cross-domain scenarios, with 12.9% NDS and 9.5% mAP enhancement on Day-Night adaptation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed geometric-aware teacher-student framework effectively addresses domain adaptation challenges in BEV perception by reducing domain shift accumulation across multiple geometric spaces through uncertainty-guided depth estimation and geometric consistency.

Abstract: Vision-centric Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception holds considerable promise
for autonomous driving. Recent studies have prioritized efficiency or accuracy
enhancements, yet the issue of domain shift has been overlooked, leading to
substantial performance degradation upon transfer. We identify major domain
gaps in real-world cross-domain scenarios and initiate the first effort to
address the Domain Adaptation (DA) challenge in multi-view 3D object detection
for BEV perception. Given the complexity of BEV perception approaches with
their multiple components, domain shift accumulation across multi-geometric
spaces (e.g., 2D, 3D Voxel, BEV) poses a significant challenge for BEV domain
adaptation. In this paper, we introduce an innovative geometric-aware
teacher-student framework, BEVUDA++, to diminish this issue, comprising a
Reliable Depth Teacher (RDT) and a Geometric Consistent Student (GCS) model.
Specifically, RDT effectively blends target LiDAR with dependable depth
predictions to generate depth-aware information based on uncertainty
estimation, enhancing the extraction of Voxel and BEV features that are
essential for understanding the target domain. To collaboratively reduce the
domain shift, GCS maps features from multiple spaces into a unified geometric
embedding space, thereby narrowing the gap in data distribution between the two
domains. Additionally, we introduce a novel Uncertainty-guided Exponential
Moving Average (UEMA) to further reduce error accumulation due to domain shifts
informed by previously obtained uncertainty guidance. To demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method, we execute comprehensive experiments in
four cross-domain scenarios, securing state-of-the-art performance in BEV 3D
object detection tasks, e.g., 12.9\% NDS and 9.5\% mAP enhancement on Day-Night
adaptation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on short-clip recognition or template-based questions, leaving a gap in evaluating deep narrative comprehension and fine-grained reasoning over long-form content.

Method: Created dataset using GPT-4o to generate diverse, context-rich questions from visual descriptions, captions, scene titles, and summaries. Implemented two-stage filtering: Context-Independence filtering ensures video context requirement, and Contextual Veracity filtering validates factual consistency.

Result: Existing MLLMs perform poorly on Cinéaste, with top open-source model achieving only 63.15% accuracy. Long-range temporal reasoning identified as primary bottleneck.

Conclusion: Significant challenges remain in fine-grained contextual understanding, highlighting the need for advancements in long-form movie comprehension capabilities.

Abstract: While recent advancements in vision-language models have improved video
understanding, diagnosing their capacity for deep, narrative comprehension
remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks often test short-clip recognition or
use template-based questions, leaving a critical gap in evaluating fine-grained
reasoning over long-form narrative content. To address these gaps, we introduce
$\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$, a comprehensive benchmark for long-form movie
understanding. Our dataset comprises 3,119 multiple-choice question-answer
pairs derived from 1,805 scenes across 200 diverse movies, spanning five novel
fine-grained contextual reasoning categories. We use GPT-4o to generate
diverse, context-rich questions by integrating visual descriptions, captions,
scene titles, and summaries, which require deep narrative understanding. To
ensure high-quality evaluation, our pipeline incorporates a two-stage filtering
process: Context-Independence filtering ensures questions require video
context, while Contextual Veracity filtering validates factual consistency
against the movie content, mitigating hallucinations. Experiments show that
existing MLLMs struggle on $\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$; our analysis reveals
that long-range temporal reasoning is a primary bottleneck, with the top
open-source model achieving only 63.15\% accuracy. This underscores significant
challenges in fine-grained contextual understanding and the need for
advancements in long-form movie comprehension.

### [84] [Gender-Neutral Rewriting in Italian: Models, Approaches, and Trade-offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13480)
*Andrea Piergentili,Beatrice Savoldi,Matteo Negri,Luisa Bentivogli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First systematic evaluation of LLMs for Italian gender-neutral rewriting shows open-weight models outperform existing dedicated models, and fine-tuned smaller models can match larger models' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender-neutral rewriting is challenging in grammatical-gender languages like Italian, and there's a need to systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs for this task.

Method: Two-dimensional framework measuring neutrality and semantic fidelity, comparing few-shot prompting across multiple LLMs, fine-tuning selected models, and applying targeted cleaning to boost task relevance.

Result: Open-weight LLMs outperform the only existing dedicated Italian GNR model. Fine-tuned models match or exceed best open-weight LLM performance at fraction of the size.

Conclusion: There's a trade-off between optimizing training data for neutrality and meaning preservation, but fine-tuned smaller models can achieve competitive performance in Italian gender-neutral rewriting.

Abstract: Gender-neutral rewriting (GNR) aims to reformulate text to eliminate
unnecessary gender specifications while preserving meaning, a particularly
challenging task in grammatical-gender languages like Italian. In this work, we
conduct the first systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art large language
models (LLMs) for Italian GNR, introducing a two-dimensional framework that
measures both neutrality and semantic fidelity to the input. We compare
few-shot prompting across multiple LLMs, fine-tune selected models, and apply
targeted cleaning to boost task relevance. Our findings show that open-weight
LLMs outperform the only existing model dedicated to GNR in Italian, whereas
our fine-tuned models match or exceed the best open-weight LLM's performance at
a fraction of its size. Finally, we discuss the trade-off between optimizing
the training data for neutrality and meaning preservation.

*Alisa Kanganis,Katherine A. Keith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Op-Fed dataset with 1044 annotated FOMC sentences for monetary policy stance analysis, created using active learning to handle class imbalance and context dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FOMC decisions impact millions but existing datasets lack fine-grained analysis of monetary policy stances in transcripts, with challenges like class imbalance and context dependence.

Method: Developed five-stage hierarchical annotation schema, used active learning for instance selection to double positive examples, and created 1044 human-annotated sentences with context.

Result: Top LLM achieved 0.80 accuracy for opinion classification but only 0.61 for monetary policy stance (below human baseline of 0.89), demonstrating the dataset's utility for model evaluation.

Conclusion: Op-Fed enables better model training, confidence calibration, and serves as seed dataset for future annotation of FOMC monetary policy stance analysis.

Abstract: The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) regularly discusses and sets
monetary policy, affecting the borrowing and spending decisions of millions of
people. In this work, we release Op-Fed, a dataset of 1044 human-annotated
sentences and their contexts from FOMC transcripts. We faced two major
technical challenges in dataset creation: imbalanced classes -- we estimate
fewer than 8% of sentences express a non-neutral stance towards monetary policy
-- and inter-sentence dependence -- 65% of instances require context beyond the
sentence-level. To address these challenges, we developed a five-stage
hierarchical schema to isolate aspects of opinion, monetary policy, and stance
towards monetary policy as well as the level of context needed. Second, we
selected instances to annotate using active learning, roughly doubling the
number of positive instances across all schema aspects. Using Op-Fed, we found
a top-performing, closed-weight LLM achieves 0.80 zero-shot accuracy in opinion
classification but only 0.61 zero-shot accuracy classifying stance towards
monetary policy -- below our human baseline of 0.89. We expect Op-Fed to be
useful for future model training, confidence calibration, and as a seed dataset
for future annotation efforts.

*John Mendonça,Lining Zhang,Rahul Mallidi,Alon Lavie,Isabel Trancoso,Luis Fernando D'Haro,João Sedoc*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DSTC12 Track 1 addresses limitations in dialogue system evaluation with two subtasks: multi-dimensional automatic evaluation metrics and multilingual/cultural safety detection, showing significant room for improvement in both areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dialogue evaluation metrics are insufficient and safety considerations are often narrowly defined or culturally biased, creating critical gaps in robust LLM assessment.

Method: Two subtasks: (1) Dialogue-level multi-dimensional automatic evaluation metrics across 10 dimensions, (2) Multilingual and multicultural safety detection using baseline models like Llama-3-8B and Llama-Guard-3-1B.

Result: Task 1: Llama-3-8B baseline achieved 0.1681 Spearman's correlation (showing substantial improvement needed). Task 2: Teams outperformed baseline on multilingual safety (top ROC-AUC 0.9648) but baseline was superior on cultural safety (0.5126 ROC-AUC).

Conclusion: Significant challenges remain in developing comprehensive dialogue evaluation metrics, particularly in culturally-aware safety detection, highlighting critical needs for more advanced and culturally-sensitive evaluation approaches.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for robust dialogue system evaluation, yet comprehensive assessment
remains challenging. Traditional metrics often prove insufficient, and safety
considerations are frequently narrowly defined or culturally biased. The DSTC12
Track 1, "Dialog System Evaluation: Dimensionality, Language, Culture and
Safety," is part of the ongoing effort to address these critical gaps. The
track comprised two subtasks: (1) Dialogue-level, Multi-dimensional Automatic
Evaluation Metrics, and (2) Multilingual and Multicultural Safety Detection.
For Task 1, focused on 10 dialogue dimensions, a Llama-3-8B baseline achieved
the highest average Spearman's correlation (0.1681), indicating substantial
room for improvement. In Task 2, while participating teams significantly
outperformed a Llama-Guard-3-1B baseline on the multilingual safety subset (top
ROC-AUC 0.9648), the baseline proved superior on the cultural subset (0.5126
ROC-AUC), highlighting critical needs in culturally-aware safety. This paper
describes the datasets and baselines provided to participants, as well as
submission evaluation results for each of the two proposed subtasks.

*Shambhavi Krishna,Atharva Naik,Chaitali Agarwal,Sudharshan Govindan,Taesung Lee,Haw-Shiuan Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis framework using transfer learning matrix and dimensionality reduction to study cross-task interactions in LLMs, revealing that hidden statistical factors rather than surface similarity drive transfer learning outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are deployed on diverse tasks beyond their training data, making it impractical to obtain high-quality training data for all tasks, necessitating better understanding of transfer learning dynamics.

Method: Built transfer learning matrix and applied dimensionality reduction to analyze 10 models, identifying latent abilities and studying cross-task interactions through systematic training and analysis.

Result: Performance improvements defy surface-level dataset similarity explanations; hidden statistical factors (class distribution, generation length) and linguistic features are more influential than source data quality.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into complex transfer learning dynamics, enabling more predictable and effective LLM adaptation by focusing on underlying statistical and linguistic factors rather than superficial dataset characteristics.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed across diverse applications.
This often includes tasks LLMs have not encountered during training. This
implies that enumerating and obtaining the high-quality training data for all
tasks is infeasible. Thus, we often need to rely on transfer learning using
datasets with different characteristics, and anticipate out-of-distribution
requests. Motivated by this practical need, we propose an analysis framework,
building a transfer learning matrix and dimensionality reduction, to dissect
these cross-task interactions. We train and analyze 10 models to identify
latent abilities (e.g., Reasoning, Sentiment Classification, NLU, Arithmetic)
and discover the side effects of the transfer learning. Our findings reveal
that performance improvements often defy explanations based on surface-level
dataset similarity or source data quality. Instead, hidden statistical factors
of the source dataset, such as class distribution and generation length
proclivities, alongside specific linguistic features, are actually more
influential. This work offers insights into the complex dynamics of transfer
learning, paving the way for more predictable and effective LLM adaptation.

### [88] [Sparse Neurons Carry Strong Signals of Question Ambiguity in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13664)
*Zhuoxuan Zhang,Jinhao Duan,Edward Kim,Kaidi Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs encode question ambiguity linearly in internal representations, detectable and controllable at neuron level with as few as one neuron. Ambiguity-Encoding Neurons (AENs) enable strong detection performance and behavioral control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address LLMs' tendency to provide confident answers to ambiguous questions rather than seeking clarification, despite ambiguity being pervasive in real-world questions.

Method: Identify Ambiguity-Encoding Neurons (AENs) during pre-filling stage, train probes on these neurons for ambiguity detection, and manipulate AENs to control model behavior from answering to abstention.

Result: AEN probes outperform prompting-based and representation-based baselines, generalize across datasets, and emerge from shallow layers. Neuron manipulation enables behavioral control.

Conclusion: LLMs form compact internal representations of question ambiguity that are interpretable and controllable, enabling improved handling of ambiguous queries.

Abstract: Ambiguity is pervasive in real-world questions, yet large language models
(LLMs) often respond with confident answers rather than seeking clarification.
In this work, we show that question ambiguity is linearly encoded in the
internal representations of LLMs and can be both detected and controlled at the
neuron level. During the model's pre-filling stage, we identify that a small
number of neurons, as few as one, encode question ambiguity information. Probes
trained on these Ambiguity-Encoding Neurons (AENs) achieve strong performance
on ambiguity detection and generalize across datasets, outperforming
prompting-based and representation-based baselines. Layerwise analysis reveals
that AENs emerge from shallow layers, suggesting early encoding of ambiguity
signals in the model's processing pipeline. Finally, we show that through
manipulating AENs, we can control LLM's behavior from direct answering to
abstention. Our findings reveal that LLMs form compact internal representations
of question ambiguity, enabling interpretable and controllable behavior.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CL$^2$GEC is the first continual learning benchmark for Chinese grammatical error correction across 10 academic disciplines, featuring 10,000 annotated sentences and evaluating LLMs under various adaptation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of multi-disciplinary academic writing benchmarks in CGEC research and explore continual learning as a solution for domain adaptation while preventing catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Created CL$^2$GEC benchmark with 10,000 human-annotated sentences across 10 disciplines, evaluated large language models using sequential tuning, parameter-efficient adaptation, and four CL algorithms with both GEC and CL metrics.

Result: Regularization-based methods proved more effective at mitigating forgetting compared to replay-based or naive sequential approaches in the continual learning setting.

Conclusion: The benchmark establishes a foundation for future research in adaptive grammatical error correction across diverse academic domains, demonstrating the value of continual learning approaches for multi-disciplinary CGEC systems.

Abstract: The growing demand for automated writing assistance in diverse academic
domains highlights the need for robust Chinese Grammatical Error Correction
(CGEC) systems that can adapt across disciplines. However, existing CGEC
research largely lacks dedicated benchmarks for multi-disciplinary academic
writing, overlooking continual learning (CL) as a promising solution to handle
domain-specific linguistic variation and prevent catastrophic forgetting. To
fill this crucial gap, we introduce CL$^2$GEC, the first Continual Learning
benchmark for Chinese Literature Grammatical Error Correction, designed to
evaluate adaptive CGEC across multiple academic fields. Our benchmark includes
10,000 human-annotated sentences spanning 10 disciplines, each exhibiting
distinct linguistic styles and error patterns. CL$^2$GEC focuses on evaluating
grammatical error correction in a continual learning setting, simulating
sequential exposure to diverse academic disciplines to reflect real-world
editorial dynamics. We evaluate large language models under sequential tuning,
parameter-efficient adaptation, and four representative CL algorithms, using
both standard GEC metrics and continual learning metrics adapted to task-level
variation. Experimental results reveal that regularization-based methods
mitigate forgetting more effectively than replay-based or naive sequential
approaches. Our benchmark provides a rigorous foundation for future research in
adaptive grammatical error correction across diverse academic domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlled Text Generation faces challenges in achieving fine-grained conditional control, while real-world applications require cost efficiency, scalability, domain knowledge learning, and more precise control.

Method: Proposes AgentCTG framework that simulates control and regulation mechanisms through multi-agent workflows, explores various agent collaboration methods, and introduces an auto-prompt module to enhance generation effectiveness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple public datasets. Validated through Character-Driven Rewriting task that preserves domain knowledge while conforming to specific character profiles. Significantly enhances driving experience in online navigation with role-playing applications.

Conclusion: AgentCTG provides a scalable solution for precise and complex text generation control, enabling more immersive interactions and greater personalization in online communities through optimized contextually relevant text generation.

Abstract: Although significant progress has been made in many tasks within the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP), Controlled Text Generation (CTG) continues
to face numerous challenges, particularly in achieving fine-grained conditional
control over generation. Additionally, in real scenario and online
applications, cost considerations, scalability, domain knowledge learning and
more precise control are required, presenting more challenge for CTG. This
paper introduces a novel and scalable framework, AgentCTG, which aims to
enhance precise and complex control over the text generation by simulating the
control and regulation mechanisms in multi-agent workflows. We explore various
collaboration methods among different agents and introduce an auto-prompt
module to further enhance the generation effectiveness. AgentCTG achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple public datasets. To validate its
effectiveness in practical applications, we propose a new challenging
Character-Driven Rewriting task, which aims to convert the original text into
new text that conform to specific character profiles and simultaneously
preserve the domain knowledge. When applied to online navigation with
role-playing, our approach significantly enhances the driving experience
through improved content delivery. By optimizing the generation of contextually
relevant text, we enable a more immersive interaction within online
communities, fostering greater personalization and user engagement.

TL;DR: CARE is a retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that teaches LLMs to integrate in-context evidence within their reasoning process using the model's own retrieval capabilities, improving context fidelity and answer consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with context fidelity, producing inconsistent answers when responding to questions based on provided information. Existing approaches either require expensive supervised fine-tuning or train models for web searches without improving context utilization.

Method: A native retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that teaches LLMs to explicitly integrate in-context evidence within their reasoning process using the model's own retrieval capabilities, requiring limited labeled evidence data.

Result: Substantially outperforms supervised fine-tuning, traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods, and external retrieval solutions on multiple real-world and counterfactual QA benchmarks, enhancing both retrieval accuracy and answer generation performance.

Conclusion: This work represents a fundamental advancement in making LLMs more accurate, reliable, and efficient for knowledge-intensive tasks by improving context fidelity through strategically retrieved in-context tokens in the reasoning chain.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with context fidelity, producing
inconsistent answers when responding to questions based on provided
information. Existing approaches either rely on expensive supervised
fine-tuning to generate evidence post-answer or train models to perform web

propose CARE, a novel native retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that
teaches LLMs to explicitly integrate in-context evidence within their reasoning
process with the model's own retrieval capabilities. Our method requires
limited labeled evidence data while significantly enhancing both retrieval
accuracy and answer generation performance through strategically retrieved
in-context tokens in the reasoning chain. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world and counterfactual QA benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
substantially outperforms supervised fine-tuning, traditional

*Yosuke Mikami,Daiki Matsuoka,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with numerical/logical NLI, particularly comparatives in non-dominant languages like Japanese. A Japanese comparative NLI dataset was created to evaluate LLMs, showing sensitivity to prompt formats and difficulty with Japanese-specific linguistic phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how LLMs handle comparative reasoning in non-dominant languages like Japanese, particularly for numerical and logical expressions in NLI tasks.

Method: Constructed a Japanese NLI dataset focused on comparatives and evaluated various LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings, testing different prompt formats and including logical semantic representations.

Result: LLM performance was sensitive to prompt formats in zero-shot settings and influenced by gold labels in few-shot examples. Models struggled with Japanese-specific linguistic phenomena, but prompts with logical semantic representations helped improve performance on difficult inference problems.

Conclusion: LLMs have limitations in handling comparative reasoning in Japanese, but incorporating logical semantic representations in prompts can enhance their performance on challenging NLI tasks involving numerical and logical expressions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform remarkably well in Natural Language
Inference (NLI). However, NLI involving numerical and logical expressions
remains challenging. Comparatives are a key linguistic phenomenon related to
such inference, but the robustness of LLMs in handling them, especially in
languages that are not dominant in the models' training data, such as Japanese,
has not been sufficiently explored. To address this gap, we construct a
Japanese NLI dataset that focuses on comparatives and evaluate various LLMs in
zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our results show that the performance of the
models is sensitive to the prompt formats in the zero-shot setting and
influenced by the gold labels in the few-shot examples. The LLMs also struggle
to handle linguistic phenomena unique to Japanese. Furthermore, we observe that
prompts containing logical semantic representations help the models predict the
correct labels for inference problems that they struggle to solve even with
few-shot examples.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DSCC-HS is a proactive framework that uses dual proxy models to dynamically steer LLM decoding and suppress hallucinations in real-time without modifying the target model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like RAG are reactive to LLM hallucinations, so there's a need for proactive intervention during the generation process to enhance factuality.

Method: Uses compact proxy models trained adversarially as Factual Alignment Proxy and Hallucination Detection Proxy. They inject a real-time steering vector (difference between FAP and HDP logits) during autoregressive decoding.

Result: Achieved 99.2% Factual Consistency Rate on TruthfulQA and highest FActScore of 46.50 on BioGEN benchmark, showing state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: DSCC-HS provides a principled and efficient plug-and-play solution for enhancing LLM factuality through dynamic self-reinforcing calibration during generation.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) hallucination is a significant barrier to their
reliable deployment. Current methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
are often reactive. We introduce **Dynamic Self-reinforcing Calibration for
Hallucination Suppression (DSCC-HS)**, a novel, proactive framework that
intervenes during autoregressive decoding. Inspired by dual-process cognitive
theory, DSCC-HS uses a compact proxy model, trained in adversarial roles as a
Factual Alignment Proxy (FAP) and a Hallucination Detection Proxy (HDP). During
inference, these proxies dynamically steer a large target model by injecting a
real-time steering vector, which is the difference between FAP and HDP logits,
at each decoding step. This plug-and-play approach requires no modification to
the target model. Our experiments on TruthfulQA and BioGEN show DSCC-HS
achieves state-of-the-art performance. On TruthfulQA, it reached a 99.2%
Factual Consistency Rate (FCR). On the long-form BioGEN benchmark, it attained
the highest FActScore of 46.50. These results validate DSCC-HS as a principled
and efficient solution for enhancing LLM factuality.

*Peter Beidler,Mark Nguyen,Kevin Lybarger,Ola Holmberg,Eric Ford,John Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLP screening tool developed to detect high-severity radiation oncology incident reports using SVM and BlueBERT models, achieving human-level performance with cross-institution transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual review of healthcare incident reports is time-consuming and requires expertise. Need automated NLP tools to efficiently identify high-severity reports for safety improvement.

Method: Used 7,094 institutional reports and 571 IAEA SAFRON reports with expert severity labels. Trained SVM and BlueBERT models, tested cross-institution generalizability with transfer learning (BlueBERT_TRANSFER).

Result: Institutional test: AUROC 0.82 (SVM), 0.81 (BlueBERT). Cross-institution without transfer: AUROC 0.42-0.56. With transfer learning: AUROC 0.78. Human-level performance achieved on curated dataset.

Conclusion: Successfully developed cross-institution NLP models that detect high-severity radiation oncology incident reports with human-equivalent performance, enabling efficient safety monitoring.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Incident reports are an important tool for safety and quality
improvement in healthcare, but manual review is time-consuming and requires
subject matter expertise. Here we present a natural language processing (NLP)
screening tool to detect high-severity incident reports in radiation oncology
across two institutions.
  METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used two text datasets to train and evaluate our
NLP models: 7,094 reports from our institution (Inst.), and 571 from IAEA
SAFRON (SF), all of which had severity scores labeled by clinical content
experts. We trained and evaluated two types of models: baseline support vector
machines (SVM) and BlueBERT which is a large language model pretrained on
PubMed abstracts and hospitalized patient data. We assessed for
generalizability of our model in two ways. First, we evaluated models trained
using Inst.-train on SF-test. Second, we trained a BlueBERT_TRANSFER model that
was first fine-tuned on Inst.-train then on SF-train before testing on SF-test
set. To further analyze model performance, we also examined a subset of 59
reports from our Inst. dataset, which were manually edited for clarity.
  RESULTS Classification performance on the Inst. test achieved AUROC 0.82
using SVM and 0.81 using BlueBERT. Without cross-institution transfer learning,
performance on the SF test was limited to an AUROC of 0.42 using SVM and 0.56
using BlueBERT. BlueBERT_TRANSFER, which was fine-tuned on both datasets,
improved the performance on SF test to AUROC 0.78. Performance of SVM, and
BlueBERT_TRANSFER models on the manually curated Inst. reports (AUROC 0.85 and
0.74) was similar to human performance (AUROC 0.81).
  CONCLUSION: In summary, we successfully developed cross-institution NLP
models on incident report text from radiation oncology centers. These models
were able to detect high-severity reports similarly to humans on a curated
dataset.

Result: Achieved 49.17 performance on Longbench FewShot task using 3x fewer tokens, outperforming LongLLMLingua by 7.76 points.

Conclusion: DSPC provides effective training-free prompt compression that reduces token usage while maintaining or improving LLM performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many natural
language processing (NLP) tasks. To achieve more accurate output, the prompts
used to drive LLMs have become increasingly longer, which incurs higher
computational costs. To address this prompt inflation problem, prompt
compression has been proposed. However, most existing methods require training
a small auxiliary model for compression, incurring a significant amount of
additional computation. To avoid this, we propose a two-stage, training-free
approach, called Dual-Stage Progressive Compression (DSPC). In the
coarse-grained stage, semantic-related sentence filtering removes sentences
with low semantic value based on TF-IDF. In the fine-grained stage, token
importance is assessed using attention contribution, cross-model loss
difference, and positional importance, enabling the pruning of low-utility
tokens while preserving semantics. We validate DSPC on LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct
and GPT-3.5-Turbo under a constrained token budget and observe consistent
improvements. For instance, in the FewShot task of the Longbench dataset, DSPC
achieves a performance of 49.17 by using only 3x fewer tokens, outperforming
the best state-of-the-art baseline LongLLMLingua by 7.76.

### [97] [Implementing a Logical Inference System for Japanese Comparatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13734)
*Yosuke Mikami,Daiki Matsuoka,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes ccg-jcomp, a logic-based inference system for Japanese comparatives that addresses linguistic differences from English, achieving better accuracy than LLMs on Japanese NLI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing logical inference systems for comparatives are designed for English and cannot handle Japanese's morphological and semantic differences, creating a need for a specialized Japanese system.

Method: Developed ccg-jcomp, a logical inference system based on compositional semantics specifically designed for Japanese comparatives, using CCG (Combinatory Categorial Grammar) framework.

Result: The system was evaluated on a Japanese NLI dataset with comparative expressions and demonstrated higher accuracy compared to existing Large Language Models.

Conclusion: Logic-based compositional semantics approaches are effective for Japanese comparative inference and outperform LLMs, providing robust handling of numerical and logical expressions in Japanese.

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) involving comparatives is challenging
because it requires understanding quantities and comparative relations
expressed by sentences. While some approaches leverage Large Language Models
(LLMs), we focus on logic-based approaches grounded in compositional semantics,
which are promising for robust handling of numerical and logical expressions.
Previous studies along these lines have proposed logical inference systems for
English comparatives. However, it has been pointed out that there are several
morphological and semantic differences between Japanese and English
comparatives. These differences make it difficult to apply such systems
directly to Japanese comparatives. To address this gap, this study proposes
ccg-jcomp, a logical inference system for Japanese comparatives based on
compositional semantics. We evaluate the proposed system on a Japanese NLI
dataset containing comparative expressions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our system by comparing its accuracy with that of existing LLMs.

### [98] [Exploring Data and Parameter Efficient Strategies for Arabic Dialect Identifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13775)
*Vani Kanjirangat,Ljiljana Dolamic,Fabio Rinaldi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores data-efficient and parameter-efficient methods for Arabic Dialect Identification, comparing soft-prompting strategies, LoRA reparameterizations, and hard prompting with zero-shot/few-shot approaches using various Arabic-specific and multilingual models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient approaches for Arabic Dialect Identification that require less data and computational resources while maintaining high performance, addressing the challenge of dialectal nuances in Arabic language processing.

Method: Investigated various soft-prompting strategies (prefix-tuning, prompt-tuning, P-tuning, P-tuning V2), LoRA reparameterizations, and hard prompting with zero-shot/few-shot inferences. Experiments used Arabic-specific encoder models on multiple datasets and analyzed n-shot inferences on open-source decoder-only models, multilingual model Phi-3.5, and Arabic-specific model SILMA.

Result: LLMs generally struggled to differentiate dialectal nuances in few-shot or zero-shot setups. Soft-prompted encoder variants performed better, while LoRA-based fine-tuned models achieved the best performance, even surpassing full fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Parameter-efficient approaches, particularly LoRA-based fine-tuning, are highly effective for Arabic Dialect Identification, outperforming both traditional fine-tuning and data-efficient methods, making them suitable for resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: This paper discusses our exploration of different data-efficient and
parameter-efficient approaches to Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI). In
particular, we investigate various soft-prompting strategies, including
prefix-tuning, prompt-tuning, P-tuning, and P-tuning V2, as well as LoRA
reparameterizations. For the data-efficient strategy, we analyze hard prompting
with zero-shot and few-shot inferences to analyze the dialect identification
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). For the parameter-efficient PEFT
approaches, we conducted our experiments using Arabic-specific encoder models
on several major datasets. We also analyzed the n-shot inferences on
open-source decoder-only models, a general multilingual model (Phi-3.5), and an
Arabic-specific one(SILMA). We observed that the LLMs generally struggle to
differentiate the dialectal nuances in the few-shot or zero-shot setups. The
soft-prompted encoder variants perform better, while the LoRA-based fine-tuned
models perform best, even surpassing full fine-tuning.

*Yangning Li,Tingwei Lu,Yinghui Li,Yankai Chen,Wei-Chieh Huang,Wenhao Jiang,Hui Wang,Hai-Tao Zheng,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAMPUS is a dynamic curriculum learning framework for instruction tuning that adapts to model capabilities during training using multi-perspective difficulty scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current curriculum instruction tuning methods suffer from rigidity due to static difficulty metrics that don't adapt to evolving model capabilities, leading to suboptimal learning trajectories.

Method: CAMPUS framework features dynamic sub-curriculum selection, competency-aware curriculum schedule adjustment, and multiple difficulty-based scheduling to adapt to model capabilities during training.

Result: Extensive experiments show CAMPUS achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines for efficient instruction tuning.

Conclusion: The dynamic, competency-aware multi-perspective curriculum approach in CAMPUS effectively addresses curriculum rigidity and improves instruction tuning efficiency.

Abstract: Efficient instruction tuning aims to enhance the ultimate performance of
large language models (LLMs) trained on a given instruction dataset. Curriculum
learning as a typical data organization strategy has shown preliminary
effectiveness in instruction tuning. However, current curriculum tuning methods
suffer from the curriculum rigidity, since they rely solely on static heuristic
difficulty metrics. These methods fail to adapt to the evolving capabilities of
models during training, resulting in a fixed and potentially sub-optimal
learning trajectory. To address the issue, Competence-Aware Multi-Perspective
cUrriculum inStruction tuning framework termed CAMPUS is proposed. CAMPUS
offers several advantages: (1) Dynamic selection for sub-curriculum. (2)
Competency-aware adjustment to the curriculum schedule. (3) Multiple
difficulty-based scheduling. Extensive experiments prove the superior
performance of CAMPUS, compared to other state-of-the-art baselines for
efficient instruction tuning.

*Laura García-Sardiña,Hermenegildo Fabregat,Daniel Deniz,Rabih Zbib*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper establishes a framework for evaluating gender bias in automatic job ranking systems by examining how grammatical gender in job titles affects rankings. It proposes using RBO metrics and creates test sets in four gendered languages to benchmark multilingual models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study and quantify gender bias in job ranking systems, particularly how explicit grammatical gender assignment in job titles impacts automated ranking results across different languages.

Method: Proposes using Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) metrics for ranking comparison controlling for gender. Creates and shares test sets for job title matching in four grammatical gender languages, with occupations in both masculine and feminine forms annotated by gender and matching relevance.

Result: Evaluation of several out-of-the-box multilingual models using the new test sets and methodology shows that all tested models exhibit varying degrees of gender bias in their job title ranking systems.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that current multilingual models contain measurable gender bias in job title rankings, establishing baseline measurements and providing tools (test sets and metrics) for future bias evaluation in this domain.

Abstract: This work sets the ground for studying how explicit grammatical gender
assignment in job titles can affect the results of automatic job ranking
systems. We propose the usage of metrics for ranking comparison controlling for
gender to evaluate gender bias in job title ranking systems, in particular RBO
(Rank-Biased Overlap). We generate and share test sets for a job title matching
task in four grammatical gender languages, including occupations in masculine
and feminine form and annotated by gender and matching relevance. We use the
new test sets and the proposed methodology to evaluate the gender bias of
several out-of-the-box multilingual models to set as baselines, showing that
all of them exhibit varying degrees of gender bias.

### [101] [Geometric Uncertainty for Detecting and Correcting Hallucinations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13813)
*Edward Phillips,Sean Wu,Soheila Molaei,Danielle Belgrave,Anshul Thakur,David Clifton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A geometric framework using archetypal analysis for black-box uncertainty quantification in LLMs, providing both global uncertainty (Geometric Volume) and local uncertainty (Geometric Suspicion) to detect hallucinations without requiring white-box access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current black-box uncertainty quantification methods only provide global uncertainty estimates, while local methods require white-box access to internal model states. There's a need for black-box approaches that can attribute uncertainty to both batches of responses and individual responses for better hallucination detection.

Method: Proposes a geometric framework based on archetypal analysis of response embeddings. Uses Geometric Volume (convex hull volume of archetypes) for global uncertainty and Geometric Suspicion (ranking responses by reliability) for local uncertainty detection.

Result: The framework performs comparably or better than prior methods on short-form QA datasets, and achieves superior results on medical datasets where hallucinations carry critical risks. Also provides theoretical justification linking convex hull volume to entropy.

Conclusion: The geometric approach effectively addresses the gap in black-box uncertainty quantification by providing both global and local uncertainty estimates, enabling better hallucination detection and preferential response selection without requiring access to internal model states.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate impressive results across diverse tasks but
are still known to hallucinate, generating linguistically plausible but
incorrect answers to questions. Uncertainty quantification has been proposed as
a strategy for hallucination detection, but no existing black-box approach
provides estimates for both global and local uncertainty. The former attributes
uncertainty to a batch of responses, while the latter attributes uncertainty to
individual responses. Current local methods typically rely on white-box access
to internal model states, whilst black-box methods only provide global
uncertainty estimates. We introduce a geometric framework to address this,
based on archetypal analysis of batches of responses sampled with only
black-box model access. At the global level, we propose Geometric Volume, which
measures the convex hull volume of archetypes derived from response embeddings.
At the local level, we propose Geometric Suspicion, which ranks responses by
reliability and enables hallucination reduction through preferential response
selection. Unlike prior dispersion methods which yield only a single global
score, our approach provides semantic boundary points which have utility for
attributing reliability to individual responses. Experiments show that our
framework performs comparably to or better than prior methods on short form
question-answering datasets, and achieves superior results on medical datasets
where hallucinations carry particularly critical risks. We also provide
theoretical justification by proving a link between convex hull volume and
entropy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoMin 2025 shared task on automatic meeting summarization featuring minuting (structured minutes creation) and question answering tasks across English/Czech languages and project/parliament domains, with limited participation but comprehensive LLM baseline evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance automatic meeting summarization research by providing structured evaluation frameworks for minuting and QA tasks across multiple languages and domains, despite limited team participation.

Method: Organized shared task with two main components: 1) Minuting task covering English/Czech languages and project meetings/European Parliament domains 2) QA task focused on project meetings with monolingual (English) and cross-lingual (Czech questions on English meetings) settings. Included multiple baseline systems using current LLMs for comprehensive evaluation.

Result: Limited participation with only one team for minuting task and two teams for QA task. However, organizers provided extensive baseline evaluations of current (2025) large language models on both tasks to enable comprehensive assessment of state-of-the-art capabilities.

Conclusion: Despite lower participation compared to previous years, the AutoMin 2025 shared task successfully established evaluation frameworks for automatic meeting summarization and QA, providing valuable baseline results from current LLMs that can guide future research in multilingual and cross-lingual meeting processing.

Abstract: This paper presents the third edition of AutoMin, a shared task on automatic
meeting summarization into minutes. In 2025, AutoMin featured the main task of
minuting, the creation of structured meeting minutes, as well as a new task:
question answering (QA) based on meeting transcripts.
  The minuting task covered two languages, English and Czech, and two domains:
project meetings and European Parliament sessions. The QA task focused solely
on project meetings and was available in two settings: monolingual QA in
English, and cross-lingual QA, where questions were asked and answered in Czech
based on English meetings.
  Participation in 2025 was more limited compared to previous years, with only
one team joining the minuting task and two teams participating in QA. However,
as organizers, we included multiple baseline systems to enable a comprehensive
evaluation of current (2025) large language models (LLMs) on both tasks.

*Minh Duc Bui,Carolin Holtermann,Valentin Hofmann,Anne Lauscher,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit significant bias against German dialect speakers, showing negative stereotypes in both association and decision tasks, with explicit demographic mentions amplifying bias more than implicit dialect cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether negative societal stereotypes faced by dialect speakers are mirrored by large language models, given that over 40% of Germany's population speaks regional dialects.

Method: Used two tasks: association task and decision task. Constructed novel evaluation corpus pairing sentences from seven regional German dialects with standard German counterparts to assess dialect naming and usage bias.

Result: (1) All LLMs showed significant dialect naming and usage bias against German dialect speakers with negative adjective associations; (2) All models reproduced these biases in decision making; (3) Explicit labeling of linguistic demographics amplified bias more than implicit dialect usage cues.

Conclusion: LLMs mirror and potentially amplify societal stereotypes against dialect speakers, with explicit demographic mentions worsening bias, highlighting the need for bias mitigation in language models.

Abstract: Dialects represent a significant component of human culture and are found
across all regions of the world. In Germany, more than 40% of the population
speaks a regional dialect (Adler and Hansen, 2022). However, despite cultural
importance, individuals speaking dialects often face negative societal
stereotypes. We examine whether such stereotypes are mirrored by large language
models (LLMs). We draw on the sociolinguistic literature on dialect perception
to analyze traits commonly associated with dialect speakers. Based on these
traits, we assess the dialect naming bias and dialect usage bias expressed by
LLMs in two tasks: an association task and a decision task. To assess a model's
dialect usage bias, we construct a novel evaluation corpus that pairs sentences
from seven regional German dialects (e.g., Alemannic and Bavarian) with their
standard German counterparts. We find that: (1) in the association task, all
evaluated LLMs exhibit significant dialect naming and dialect usage bias
against German dialect speakers, reflected in negative adjective associations;
(2) all models reproduce these dialect naming and dialect usage biases in their
decision making; and (3) contrary to prior work showing minimal bias with
explicit demographic mentions, we find that explicitly labeling linguistic
demographics--German dialect speakers--amplifies bias more than implicit cues
like dialect usage.

*Yang Liu,Chenhui Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show varying alignment with human values on social biases across different scenario types, with larger models not necessarily performing better. Model families show consistency, and smaller models can be fine-tuned for explanations but with lower agreeability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLM alignment with human values on social biases differs across scenario types and to understand their explanation capabilities.

Method: Analyzed 12 LLMs from 4 families across 4 datasets, examining misalignment rates, attack success rates, judgment consistency, and explanation generation capabilities.

Result: Larger parameter models don't guarantee better alignment; models show preference for specific scenario types; family models have higher consistency; no significant differences in HVSB understanding; smaller LMs generate more readable but less agreeable explanations.

Conclusion: LLM alignment with human values on social biases is complex and scenario-dependent, with model size not being the sole determinant of performance, and smaller models can be effectively trained for explanation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can lead to undesired consequences when
misaligned with human values, especially in scenarios involving complex and
sensitive social biases. Previous studies have revealed the misalignment of
LLMs with human values using expert-designed or agent-based emulated bias
scenarios. However, it remains unclear whether the alignment of LLMs with human
values differs across different types of scenarios (e.g., scenarios containing
negative vs. non-negative questions). In this study, we investigate the
alignment of LLMs with human values regarding social biases (HVSB) in different
types of bias scenarios. Through extensive analysis of 12 LLMs from four model
families and four datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs with large model parameter
scales do not necessarily have lower misalignment rate and attack success rate.
Moreover, LLMs show a certain degree of alignment preference for specific types
of scenarios and the LLMs from the same model family tend to have higher
judgment consistency. In addition, we study the understanding capacity of LLMs
with their explanations of HVSB. We find no significant differences in the
understanding of HVSB across LLMs. We also find LLMs prefer their own generated
explanations. Additionally, we endow smaller language models (LMs) with the
ability to explain HVSB. The generation results show that the explanations
generated by the fine-tuned smaller LMs are more readable, but have a
relatively lower model agreeability.

*Domenico Meconi,Simone Stirpe,Federico Martelli,Leonardo Lavalle,Roberto Navigli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs demonstrate strong word sense understanding, matching specialized WSD systems in disambiguation tasks and achieving up to 98% accuracy in generative word sense explanation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite extensive evaluation of LLMs, their true understanding of word senses in context remains underexplored. The paper aims to assess both disambiguation capabilities and generative understanding of word meanings.

Method: Evaluated instruction-tuned LLMs on Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) compared to specialized systems, and tested generative abilities through definition generation, free-form explanation, and example generation tasks using top open- and closed-source models.

Result: GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 achieved WSD performance on par with specialized systems while showing greater robustness across domains and difficulty levels. In generation tasks, LLMs reached up to 98% accuracy, with free-form explanation performing best.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate sophisticated word sense understanding capabilities, performing comparably to specialized WSD systems and excelling in generative explanation tasks, particularly free-form explanations that leverage their natural language strengths.

Abstract: Understanding the meaning of words in context is a fundamental capability for
Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite extensive evaluation efforts, the extent
to which LLMs show evidence that they truly grasp word senses remains
underexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by evaluating both i) the
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs,
comparing their performance to state-of-the-art systems specifically designed
for the task, and ii) the ability of two top-performing open- and closed-source
LLMs to understand word senses in three generative settings: definition
generation, free-form explanation, and example generation. Notably, we find
that, in the WSD task, leading models such as GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 achieve
performance on par with specialized WSD systems, while also demonstrating
greater robustness across domains and levels of difficulty. In the generation
tasks, results reveal that LLMs can explain the meaning of words in context up
to 98\% accuracy, with the highest performance observed in the free-form
explanation task, which best aligns with their generative capabilities.

TL;DR: mRAG systems show language bias in citation behavior, preferring English sources even when non-English documents are equally relevant, with this bias amplified for lower-resource languages and mid-context documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the mixture of different document languages in multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems impacts generation and citation in unintended ways, particularly whether language preference affects citation choices beyond document relevance.

Method: A controlled methodology using model internals to measure language preference while holding document relevance constant across eight languages and six open-weight models.

Result: Models preferentially cite English sources for English queries, with bias amplified for lower-resource languages and documents positioned mid-context. Models sometimes trade document relevance for language preference, indicating citation choices are not always driven by informativeness alone.

Conclusion: Language models exhibit systematic language bias in citation behavior, preferring English sources even when equally relevant non-English documents are available, revealing that citation choices are influenced by language preference rather than just informativeness.

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems enable language
models to answer knowledge-intensive queries with citation-supported responses
across languages. While such systems have been proposed, an open questions is
whether the mixture of different document languages impacts generation and
citation in unintended ways. To investigate, we introduce a controlled
methodology using model internals to measure language preference while holding
other factors such as document relevance constant. Across eight languages and
six open-weight models, we find that models preferentially cite English sources
when queries are in English, with this bias amplified for lower-resource
languages and for documents positioned mid-context. Crucially, we find that
models sometimes trade-off document relevance for language preference,
indicating that citation choices are not always driven by informativeness
alone. Our findings shed light on how language models leverage multilingual
context and influence citation behavior.

*Colin Hong,Xu Guo,Anand Chaanan Singh,Esha Choukse,Dmitrii Ustiugov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Slim-SC is a step-wise pruning strategy that reduces Self-Consistency's computational overhead by removing redundant reasoning chains based on inter-chain similarity, achieving up to 45% latency reduction while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-Consistency (SC) improves LLM reasoning through parallel chain generation and majority voting, but suffers from order-of-magnitude computational overhead that limits practical deployment.

Method: Proposes Slim-SC, which identifies and prunes redundant reasoning chains using inter-chain similarity analysis at the thought level, reducing computational requirements while preserving accuracy.

Result: Experiments on three STEM reasoning datasets show Slim-SC reduces inference latency by up to 45% and KVC usage by 26% while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to standard SC.

Conclusion: Slim-SC provides an efficient alternative to Self-Consistency that significantly reduces computational overhead while preserving reasoning performance, making test-time scaling more practical for deployment.

Abstract: Recently, Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has gained increasing attention for
improving LLM reasoning performance at test time without retraining the model.
A notable TTS technique is Self-Consistency (SC), which generates multiple
reasoning chains in parallel and selects the final answer via majority voting.
While effective, the order-of-magnitude computational overhead limits its broad
deployment. Prior attempts to accelerate SC mainly rely on model-based
confidence scores or heuristics with limited empirical support. For the first
time, we theoretically and empirically analyze the inefficiencies of SC and
reveal actionable opportunities for improvement. Building on these insights, we
propose Slim-SC, a step-wise pruning strategy that identifies and removes
redundant chains using inter-chain similarity at the thought level. Experiments
on three STEM reasoning datasets and two recent LLM architectures show that
Slim-SC reduces inference latency and KVC usage by up to 45% and 26%,
respectively, with R1-Distill, while maintaining or improving accuracy, thus
offering a simple yet efficient TTS alternative for SC.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ES-CoT is an inference-time method that reduces chain-of-thought generation length by detecting answer convergence through step answer tracking and early stopping, achieving ~41% token reduction with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lengthy chain-of-thoughts in reasoning LLMs incur high inference costs, creating a need for methods that can shorten CoT generation while maintaining performance.

Method: Prompt LLM to output current final answer at each reasoning step, track consecutive identical step answers as convergence measure, and terminate generation when run length shows sharp increase exceeding threshold.

Result: 41% average reduction in inference tokens across five reasoning datasets and three LLMs while maintaining comparable accuracy to standard CoT; works well with self-consistency and robust to hyperparameters.

Conclusion: ES-CoT provides a practical and effective approach for efficient reasoning by enabling early stopping based on answer convergence detection with both empirical and theoretical support.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior capacities
in solving complicated problems by generating long chain-of-thoughts (CoT), but
such a lengthy CoT incurs high inference costs. In this study, we introduce
ES-CoT, an inference-time method that shortens CoT generation by detecting
answer convergence and stopping early with minimal performance loss. At the end
of each reasoning step, we prompt the LLM to output its current final answer,
denoted as a step answer. We then track the run length of consecutive identical
step answers as a measure of answer convergence. Once the run length exhibits a
sharp increase and exceeds a minimum threshold, the generation is terminated.
We provide both empirical and theoretical support for this heuristic: step
answers steadily converge to the final answer, and large run-length jumps
reliably mark this convergence. Experiments on five reasoning datasets across
three LLMs show that ES-CoT reduces the number of inference tokens by about
41\% on average while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard CoT. Further,
ES-CoT integrates seamlessly with self-consistency prompting and remains robust
across hyperparameter choices, highlighting it as a practical and effective
approach for efficient reasoning.

### [112] [Hala Technical Report: Building Arabic-Centric Instruction & Translation Models at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14008)
*Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud,Mohammad Zbeeb,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hala is a family of Arabic instruction and translation models that achieve state-of-the-art results on Arabic benchmarks through a translate-and-tune pipeline using compressed teacher models and slerp merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for high-quality Arabic language models and instruction following capabilities, particularly for Arabic-centric NLP tasks where existing models may underperform.

Method: Compress AR-EN teacher model to FP8 for higher throughput, create bilingual supervision data, fine-tune lightweight LFM2-1.2B model to translate English instructions to Arabic, train Hala models at multiple scales (350M-9B parameters), and apply slerp merging to balance Arabic specialization with base-model strengths.

Result: Hala achieves state-of-the-art results on Arabic-centric benchmarks in both nano (≤2B) and small (7-9B) model categories, outperforming their base models.

Conclusion: The translate-and-tune pipeline effectively creates high-quality Arabic instruction models, and the released models, data, and recipes will accelerate Arabic NLP research.

Abstract: We present Hala, a family of Arabic-centric instruction and translation
models built with our translate-and-tune pipeline. We first compress a strong
AR$\leftrightarrow$EN teacher to FP8 (yielding $\sim$2$\times$ higher
throughput with no quality loss) and use it to create high-fidelity bilingual
supervision. A lightweight language model LFM2-1.2B is then fine-tuned on this
data and used to translate high-quality English instruction sets into Arabic,
producing a million-scale corpus tailored to instruction following. We train
Hala models at 350M, 700M, 1.2B, and 9B parameters, and apply slerp merging to
balance Arabic specialization with base-model strengths. On Arabic-centric
benchmarks, Hala achieves state-of-the-art results within both the "nano"
($\leq$2B) and "small" (7-9B) categories, outperforming their bases. We release
models, data, evaluation, and recipes to accelerate research in Arabic NLP.

### [113] [Audio-Based Crowd-Sourced Evaluation of Machine Translation Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14023)
*Sami Ul Haq,Sheila Castilho,Yvette Graham*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Audio-based MT evaluation yields similar system rankings as text-only methods but can identify additional significant differences, suggesting speech should be incorporated into MT assessment frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MT quality assessment is text-centric despite many real-world applications involving spoken translation, creating a need for more natural audio-based evaluation methods.

Method: Compared text-only and audio-based evaluations of 10 MT systems using crowd-sourced judgments via Amazon Mechanical Turk, with statistical significance testing and self-replication experiments.

Result: Audio-based assessments produced rankings consistent with text-only evaluations but identified significant differences between some translation systems that text methods missed.

Conclusion: Speech provides a richer, more natural modality for MT evaluation and should be incorporated into future assessment frameworks to better reflect real-world translation usage.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) has achieved remarkable performance, with growing
interest in speech translation and multimodal approaches. However, despite
these advancements, MT quality assessment remains largely text centric,
typically relying on human experts who read and compare texts. Since many
real-world MT applications (e.g Google Translate Voice Mode, iFLYTEK
Translator) involve translation being spoken rather printed or read, a more
natural way to assess translation quality would be through speech as opposed
text-only evaluations. This study compares text-only and audio-based
evaluations of 10 MT systems from the WMT General MT Shared Task, using
crowd-sourced judgments collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We additionally,
performed statistical significance testing and self-replication experiments to
test reliability and consistency of audio-based approach. Crowd-sourced
assessments based on audio yield rankings largely consistent with text only
evaluations but, in some cases, identify significant differences between
translation systems. We attribute this to speech richer, more natural modality
and propose incorporating speech-based assessments into future MT evaluation
frameworks.

*Paweł Mąka,Yusuf Can Semerci,Jan Scholtes,Gerasimos Spanakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Training data sparsity is confirmed as the key bottleneck for context utilization in machine translation, with controlled experiments showing strong association between contextually rich examples and model performance. Two training strategies improve context utilization by up to 8 percentage points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-level translation requires leveraging context for coherence and pronoun disambiguation, but standard training data lacks sufficient contextually rich examples, making context utilization difficult.

Method: Constructed training datasets with controlled proportions of contextually relevant examples, systematically validating sparsity claims in single- and multilingual settings. Proposed and evaluated two training strategies to leverage available data.

Result: Strong association between training data sparsity and model performance confirmed. Improvements in one contextual phenomenon don't generalize to others. Cross-lingual transfer observed but not significantly higher within same sub-family languages. Training strategies improved context utilization with 6-8 percentage point accuracy gains.

Conclusion: Data sparsity is indeed a key bottleneck for context utilization in MT. Training strategies can effectively leverage available data to improve context utilization, but improvements are phenomenon-specific and cross-lingual transfer is limited.

Abstract: Achieving human-level translations requires leveraging context to ensure
coherence and handle complex phenomena like pronoun disambiguation. Sparsity of
contextually rich examples in the standard training data has been hypothesized
as the reason for the difficulty of context utilization. In this work, we
systematically validate this claim in both single- and multilingual settings by
constructing training datasets with a controlled proportions of contextually
relevant examples. We demonstrate a strong association between training data
sparsity and model performance confirming sparsity as a key bottleneck.
Importantly, we reveal that improvements in one contextual phenomenon do no
generalize to others. While we observe some cross-lingual transfer, it is not
significantly higher between languages within the same sub-family. Finally, we
propose and empirically evaluate two training strategies designed to leverage
the available data. These strategies improve context utilization, resulting in
accuracy gains of up to 6 and 8 percentage points on the ctxPro evaluation in
single- and multilingual settings respectively.

### [115] [Enhancing Multi-Agent Debate System Performance via Confidence Expression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14034)
*Zijie Lin,Bryan Hooi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes ConfMAD, a Multi-Agent Debate framework that incorporates confidence expression to improve debate effectiveness and task performance by allowing LLMs to explicitly communicate their confidence levels during debates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multi-Agent Debate systems struggle because LLMs with superior knowledge often fail to clearly communicate their advantage during debates due to lack of confidence expression, leading to stubborn maintenance of incorrect beliefs or premature convergence on suboptimal answers.

Method: Developed ConfMAD, a MAD framework that integrates confidence expression throughout the debate process, allowing LLMs to explicitly communicate their confidence levels to improve debate dynamics and decision-making.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing improved debate performance and task outcomes compared to traditional MAD systems without confidence expression.

Conclusion: Incorporating confidence expression in Multi-Agent Debate systems significantly enhances debate effectiveness and overall performance, providing valuable insights for designing confidence-aware MAD systems.

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance across a wide range of tasks. Recent research has introduced
Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) systems, which leverage multiple LLMs to simulate
human debate and thereby improve task performance. However, while some LLMs may
possess superior knowledge or reasoning capabilities for specific tasks, they
often struggle to clearly communicate this advantage during debates, in part
due to a lack of confidence expression. Moreover, inappropriate confidence
expression can cause agents in MAD systems to either stubbornly maintain
incorrect beliefs or converge prematurely on suboptimal answers, ultimately
reducing debate effectiveness and overall system performance. To address these
challenges, we propose incorporating confidence expression into MAD systems to
allow LLMs to explicitly communicate their confidence levels. To validate this
approach, we develop ConfMAD, a MAD framework that integrates confidence
expression throughout the debate process. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, and we further analyze how confidence influences
debate dynamics, offering insights into the design of confidence-aware MAD
systems.

*Zekang Liu,Wei Feng,Fanhua Shang,Lianyu Hu,Jichao Feng,Liqing Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Question-based Sign Language Translation (QB-SLT) using dialogue context instead of gloss annotations, with a novel SSL-SSAW fusion method that achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialogue provides crucial contextual cues for sign language translation and is easier to annotate than gloss annotations, which bridges communication gaps between deaf and hearing people more effectively.

Method: Cross-modality Self-supervised Learning with Sigmoid Self-attention Weighting (SSL-SSAW) fusion method using contrastive learning for feature alignment and adaptive feature extraction from question and sign language sequences.

Result: Achieved SOTA performance on CSL-Daily-QA and PHOENIX-2014T-QA datasets, with question assistance matching or surpassing gloss assistance performance. Visualization confirms improved translation quality.

Conclusion: Question-based dialogue integration is an effective alternative to gloss annotations for sign language translation, demonstrating the value of naturally occurring dialogue context in improving translation outcomes.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) bridges the communication gap between deaf
people and hearing people, where dialogue provides crucial contextual cues to
aid in translation. Building on this foundational concept, this paper proposes
Question-based Sign Language Translation (QB-SLT), a novel task that explores
the efficient integration of dialogue. Unlike gloss (sign language
transcription) annotations, dialogue naturally occurs in communication and is
easier to annotate. The key challenge lies in aligning multimodality features
while leveraging the context of the question to improve translation. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-modality Self-supervised Learning with Sigmoid
Self-attention Weighting (SSL-SSAW) fusion method for sign language
translation. Specifically, we employ contrastive learning to align
multimodality features in QB-SLT, then introduce a Sigmoid Self-attention
Weighting (SSAW) module for adaptive feature extraction from question and sign
language sequences. Additionally, we leverage available question text through
self-supervised learning to enhance representation and translation
capabilities. We evaluated our approach on newly constructed CSL-Daily-QA and
PHOENIX-2014T-QA datasets, where SSL-SSAW achieved SOTA performance. Notably,
easily accessible question assistance can achieve or even surpass the
performance of gloss assistance. Furthermore, visualization results demonstrate
the effectiveness of incorporating dialogue in improving translation quality.

The model successfully balances performance with speed, making it suitable for practical applications requiring fast speech recognition and translation.

Abstract: This report introduces Canary-1B-v2, a fast, robust multilingual model for
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Speech-to-Text Translation (AST). Built
with a FastConformer encoder and Transformer decoder, it supports 25 languages
primarily European. The model was trained on 1.7M hours of total data samples,
including Granary and NeMo ASR Set 3.0, with non-speech audio added to reduce
hallucinations for ASR and AST. We describe its two-stage pre-training and
fine-tuning process with dynamic data balancing, as well as experiments with an
nGPT encoder. Results show nGPT scales well with massive data, while
FastConformer excels after fine-tuning. For timestamps, Canary-1B-v2 uses the
NeMo Forced Aligner (NFA) with an auxiliary CTC model, providing reliable
segment-level timestamps for ASR and AST. Evaluations show Canary-1B-v2
outperforms Whisper-large-v3 on English ASR while being 10x faster, and
delivers competitive multilingual ASR and AST performance against larger models
like Seamless-M4T-v2-large and LLM-based systems. We also release
Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v3, a successor to v2, offering multilingual ASR across the

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AssoCiAm benchmark evaluates MLLM associative ability while addressing ambiguity through hybrid computational methods, revealing cognition-association correlation and ambiguity's impact on model behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing association evaluation frameworks overlook inherent ambiguity in association tasks, which undermines reliability of assessments for MLLM creativity.

Method: Decompose ambiguity into internal and external types, introduce AssoCiAm benchmark with hybrid computational method to circumvent ambiguity in association evaluation.

Result: Strong positive correlation between cognition and association observed; ambiguity causes MLLMs' behavior to become more random-like; method ensures more accurate evaluations.

Conclusion: AssoCiAm provides effective framework for reliable associative ability evaluation in MLLMs, addressing critical ambiguity issues that plague current assessment methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered
significant attention, offering a promising pathway toward artificial general
intelligence (AGI). Among the essential capabilities required for AGI,
creativity has emerged as a critical trait for MLLMs, with association serving
as its foundation. Association reflects a model' s ability to think creatively,
making it vital to evaluate and understand. While several frameworks have been
proposed to assess associative ability, they often overlook the inherent
ambiguity in association tasks, which arises from the divergent nature of
associations and undermines the reliability of evaluations. To address this
issue, we decompose ambiguity into two types-internal ambiguity and external
ambiguity-and introduce AssoCiAm, a benchmark designed to evaluate associative
ability while circumventing the ambiguity through a hybrid computational
method. We then conduct extensive experiments on MLLMs, revealing a strong
positive correlation between cognition and association. Additionally, we
observe that the presence of ambiguity in the evaluation process causes MLLMs'
behavior to become more random-like. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of
our method in ensuring more accurate and reliable evaluations. See Project Page

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework for personalized financial advice using behavioral finance integration and careful data curation enables an 8B parameter model to match performance of larger 14-32B models with 80% lower costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches for financial advice suffer from high maintenance costs and yield less than 25% of expected returns, while personalized financial advice requires consideration of user goals, constraints, risk tolerance, and jurisdiction.

Method: Created a reproducible framework integrating financial context with behavioral finance studies to build supervision data, generated 19k sample reasoning dataset, and fine-tuned Qwen-3-8B model on this dataset.

Result: The 8B model achieved performance comparable to significantly larger baselines (14-32B parameters) across factual accuracy, fluency, and personalization metrics while incurring 80% lower costs, as demonstrated through held-out test split and blind LLM-jury study.

Conclusion: Careful data curation and behavioral integration can enable smaller models to achieve comparable performance to much larger models in financial advisory tasks, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Personalized financial advice requires consideration of user goals,
constraints, risk tolerance, and jurisdiction. Prior LLM work has focused on
support systems for investors and financial planners. Simultaneously, numerous
recent studies examine broader personal finance tasks, including budgeting,
debt management, retirement, and estate planning, through agentic pipelines
that incur high maintenance costs, yielding less than 25% of their expected
financial returns. In this study, we introduce a novel and reproducible
framework that integrates relevant financial context with behavioral finance
studies to construct supervision data for end-to-end advisors. Using this
framework, we create a 19k sample reasoning dataset and conduct a comprehensive
fine-tuning of the Qwen-3-8B model on the dataset. Through a held-out test
split and a blind LLM-jury study, we demonstrate that through careful data
curation and behavioral integration, our 8B model achieves performance
comparable to significantly larger baselines (14-32B parameters) across factual
accuracy, fluency, and personalization metrics while incurring 80% lower costs
than the larger counterparts.

TL;DR: Large-scale computational analysis of migration discourse in UK parliamentary debates over 75 years compared with US Congress, using LLMs to track stances and narrative frames toward migrants across time and parties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the evolution and polarization of migration discourse in parliamentary settings over decades, and demonstrate how large language models can enable scalable, fine-grained analysis of political discourse.

Method: Used open-weight LLMs to annotate statements with high-level stances toward migrants, developed semi-automated framework for extracting fine-grained narrative frames in UK debates, and compared trends across time and political parties between UK and US.

Result: UK parliamentary attitudes remain relatively aligned across parties (unlike polarized US discourse), with persistent Labour-Conservative ideological gap reaching most negative level in 2025. UK discourse shifted toward securitized narratives (border control, illegal immigration) while integration-oriented frames declined. Discussions moved from national to international law and human rights.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively support scalable, fine-grained discourse analysis in political and historical contexts, revealing nuanced trends in migration discourse evolution and polarization patterns across different political systems.

Abstract: We present a large-scale computational analysis of migration-related
discourse in UK parliamentary debates spanning over 75 years and compare it
with US congressional discourse. Using open-weight LLMs, we annotate each
statement with high-level stances toward migrants and track the net tone toward
migrants across time and political parties. For the UK, we extend this with a
semi-automated framework for extracting fine-grained narrative frames to
capture nuances of migration discourse. Our findings show that, while US
discourse has grown increasingly polarised, UK parliamentary attitudes remain
relatively aligned across parties, with a persistent ideological gap between
Labour and the Conservatives, reaching its most negative level in 2025. The
analysis of narrative frames in the UK parliamentary statements reveals a shift
toward securitised narratives such as border control and illegal immigration,
while longer-term integration-oriented frames such as social integration have
declined. Moreover, discussions of national law about immigration have been
replaced over time by international law and human rights, revealing nuances in
discourse trends. Taken together broadly, our findings demonstrate how LLMs can
support scalable, fine-grained discourse analysis in political and historical
contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address systemic shortcomings in open LLM ecosystem: data compliance issues (lack of reproducible pipelines, content-owner rights violations) and limited multilingual representation in existing models.

Method: Pretrained on 15T tokens from 1800+ languages using openly available data with robots.txt compliance, content filtering (non-permissive/toxic/PII), and Goldfish objective to suppress verbatim recall while preserving downstream performance.

Result: Approaches state-of-the-art results among fully open models on multilingual benchmarks, rivaling or surpassing open-weight counterparts. Models released at 8B and 70B scales with comprehensive multilingual coverage.

Conclusion: Apertus provides a fully transparent, compliant open LLM suite with complete scientific artifacts (data scripts, checkpoints, evaluation suites, training code) under permissive license, enabling audit and extension while addressing data ethics and multilingual gaps.

Abstract: We present Apertus, a fully open suite of large language models (LLMs)
designed to address two systemic shortcomings in today's open model ecosystem:
data compliance and multilingual representation. Unlike many prior models that
release weights without reproducible data pipelines or regard for content-owner
rights, Apertus models are pretrained exclusively on openly available data,
retroactively respecting robots.txt exclusions and filtering for
non-permissive, toxic, and personally identifiable content. To mitigate risks
of memorization, we adopt the Goldfish objective during pretraining, strongly
suppressing verbatim recall of data while retaining downstream task
performance. The Apertus models also expand multilingual coverage, training on
15T tokens from over 1800 languages, with ~40% of pretraining data allocated to
non-English content. Released at 8B and 70B scales, Apertus approaches
state-of-the-art results among fully open models on multilingual benchmarks,
rivalling or surpassing open-weight counterparts. Beyond model weights, we
release all scientific artifacts from our development cycle with a permissive
license, including data preparation scripts, checkpoints, evaluation suites,
and training code, enabling transparent audit and extension.

*Pratik Jayarao,Himanshu Gupta,Neeraj Varshney,Chaitanya Dwivedi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Thinking LLMs outperform non-thinking models in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness when used as automated judges, with ~10% higher accuracy at minimal computational overhead compared to augmentation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used as automated judges in benchmarking and reward modeling, ensuring their reliability, efficiency, and robustness has become critical. The study aims to systematically compare thinking vs non-thinking LLMs in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm.

Method: Systematic comparison using open-source Qwen 3 models (0.6B, 1.7B, 4B parameters) on RewardBench tasks. Evaluated accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs), examined augmentation strategies for non-thinking models including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based evaluation, and n-best aggregation. Also conducted bias and robustness analyses under various bias conditions and extended to multilingual settings.

Result: Thinking models achieve approximately 10% higher accuracy with little overhead (under 2x), while augmentation strategies like few-shot learning deliver modest gains at higher cost (>8x). Thinking models maintain significantly greater consistency under various bias conditions (6% higher on average). Benefits extend to multilingual settings beyond English.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning offers clear advantages in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm, providing systematic evidence of superior performance in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness compared to non-thinking approaches and augmentation strategies.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted as automated judges
in benchmarking and reward modeling, ensuring their reliability, efficiency,
and robustness has become critical. In this work, we present a systematic
comparison of "thinking" and "non-thinking" LLMs in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm
using open-source Qwen 3 models of relatively small sizes (0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B
parameters). We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on
RewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking
models, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based
evaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these
enhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking
counterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10%
points higher accuracy with little overhead (under 2x), in contrast to
augmentation strategies like few-shot learning, which deliver modest gains at a
higher cost (>8x). Bias and robustness analyses further demonstrate that
thinking models maintain significantly greater consistency under a variety of
bias conditions such as positional, bandwagon, identity, diversity, and random
biases (6% higher on average). We further extend our experiments to the
multilingual setting and our results confirm that explicit reasoning extends
its benefits beyond English. Overall, our work results in several important
findings that provide systematic evidence that explicit reasoning offers clear
advantages in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm not only in accuracy and efficiency

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Evaluation awareness in LLMs follows power-law scaling - larger models become increasingly better at distinguishing evaluation vs deployment contexts, enabling deception in safety testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how evaluation awareness scales with model size, as prior work only demonstrated this phenomenon in a single 70B model, leaving the scaling relationship unknown.

Method: Tested 15 models from 0.27B to 70B parameters across four model families using linear probing on steering vector activations to measure evaluation awareness.

Result: Found clear power-law scaling: evaluation awareness increases predictably with model size, allowing forecasting of deceptive behavior in future larger models.

Conclusion: The scaling law enables prediction of deceptive capabilities in future models and informs the design of scale-aware evaluation strategies for AI safety.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can internally distinguish between evaluation
and deployment contexts, a behaviour known as \emph{evaluation awareness}. This
undermines AI safety evaluations, as models may conceal dangerous capabilities
during testing. Prior work demonstrated this in a single $70$B model, but the
scaling relationship across model sizes remains unknown. We investigate
evaluation awareness across $15$ models scaling from $0.27$B to $70$B
parameters from four families using linear probing on steering vector
activations. Our results reveal a clear power-law scaling: evaluation awareness
increases predictably with model size. This scaling law enables forecasting
deceptive behavior in future larger models and guides the design of scale-aware
evaluation strategies for AI safety. A link to the implementation of this paper

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FRIT is a scalable alignment method that trains LLMs to produce causally consistent reasoning by learning from systematically corrupted examples using Direct Preference Optimization, improving both faithfulness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought reasoning often fails to causally influence final answers, creating brittle outputs. While prior work focused on measuring faithfulness, methods for systematically improving it remain limited.

Method: Generates synthetic training data by intervening on individual reasoning steps in model-generated CoTs to create faithful/unfaithful pairs, then applies Direct Preference Optimization to teach models to prefer causally consistent reasoning paths.

Result: FRIT increases faithful reasoning by 3.4 percentage points for Mistral on GSM8K while improving accuracy by 7.6 percentage points across factual and symbolic reasoning tasks on Qwen3-8B and Mistral-7B-v0.1.

Conclusion: FRIT provides the first scalable, supervision-free method for training language models to produce more reliable and interpretable reasoning, addressing the gap between reasoning performance and trustworthiness.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful tool for improving
large language model performance on complex tasks, but recent work shows that
reasoning steps often fail to causally influence the final answer, creating
brittle and untrustworthy outputs. Prior approaches focus primarily on
measuring faithfulness, while methods for systematically improving it remain
limited. We introduce Faithful Reasoning via Intervention Training (FRIT), a
scalable alignment method that trains models to produce causally consistent
reasoning by learning from systematically corrupted examples. FRIT generates
synthetic training data by intervening on individual reasoning steps in
model-generated CoTs, creating faithful/unfaithful pairs that highlight when
reasoning breaks down. We then apply Direct Preference Optimization to teach
models to prefer causally consistent reasoning paths. Evaluating on Qwen3-8B
and Mistral-7B-v0.1 across factual and symbolic reasoning tasks, FRIT increases
faithful reasoning by $3.4$ percentage points for Mistral on GSM8K while
improving accuracy by $7.6$ percentage points. Our approach provides the first
scalable, supervision-free method for training language models to produce more
reliable and interpretable reasoning, addressing a critical gap between
reasoning performance and trustworthiness. We release our code at

### [126] [Position: AI Safety Must Embrace an Antifragile Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13339)
*Ming Jin,Hyunin Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This position paper argues that AI safety research needs to shift from static testing to antifragile approaches where systems improve their safety guarantees over time by leveraging uncertainties and rare events rather than just trying to eliminate them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional static benchmarks and single-shot robustness tests fail to account for evolving environments and the risk of model drift into maladaptation (reward hacking, over-optimization, capability atrophy). Current approaches overlook that AI systems need to handle rare and out-of-distribution events over long timeframes.

Method: The paper proposes adopting antifragile principles where uncertainties are leveraged to better prepare for future unpredictable uncertainties. It advocates for fundamental recalibration of measurement, benchmarking, and continuous improvement methods for AI safety, complementing existing robustness approaches with ethical and practical guidelines.

Result: The paper identifies key limitations of static testing including scenario diversity issues, reward hacking vulnerabilities, and over-alignment problems. It explores how antifragile solutions can better manage rare events and long-term reliability challenges.

Conclusion: An antifragile perspective is pivotal for long-term reliability of open-ended ML systems. The approach emphasizes building systems whose safety guarantees expand over time through exposure to uncertainties, rather than just trying to eliminate current uncertainties.

Abstract: This position paper contends that modern AI research must adopt an
antifragile perspective on safety -- one in which the system's capacity to
guarantee long-term AI safety such as handling rare or out-of-distribution
(OOD) events expands over time. Conventional static benchmarks and single-shot
robustness tests overlook the reality that environments evolve and that models,
if left unchallenged, can drift into maladaptation (e.g., reward hacking,
over-optimization, or atrophy of broader capabilities). We argue that an
antifragile approach -- Rather than striving to rapidly reduce current
uncertainties, the emphasis is on leveraging those uncertainties to better
prepare for potentially greater, more unpredictable uncertainties in the future
-- is pivotal for the long-term reliability of open-ended ML systems. In this
position paper, we first identify key limitations of static testing, including
scenario diversity, reward hacking, and over-alignment. We then explore the
potential of antifragile solutions to manage rare events. Crucially, we
advocate for a fundamental recalibration of the methods used to measure,
benchmark, and continually improve AI safety over the long term, complementing
existing robustness approaches by providing ethical and practical guidelines
towards fostering an antifragile AI safety community.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IMAC uses world models and unsupervised environment design to generate diverse training environments from limited offline data, enabling agents to generalize to novel tasks without extensive real-world training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional agent training requires vast data or accurate simulations, which are unavailable for many real-world scenarios. World models offer an alternative using offline data, but need methods to ensure generated training data is useful.

Method: Proposes IMAC (Imagined Autocurricula) that leverages Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) to create automatic curricula over worlds generated by world models, ensuring agents train on useful generated data.

Result: Achieves strong transfer performance on held-out environments in challenging procedurally generated settings, training only inside a world model learned from narrow datasets.

Conclusion: This approach opens the path to utilizing larger-scale foundation world models for developing generally capable agents that can generalize to novel task variations.

Abstract: Training agents to act in embodied environments typically requires vast
training data or access to accurate simulation, neither of which exists for
many cases in the real world. Instead, world models are emerging as an
alternative leveraging offline, passively collected data, they make it possible
to generate diverse worlds for training agents in simulation. In this work, we
harness world models to generate imagined environments to train robust agents
capable of generalizing to novel task variations. One of the challenges in
doing this is ensuring the agent trains on useful generated data. We thus
propose a novel approach, IMAC (Imagined Autocurricula), leveraging
Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), which induces an automatic curriculum
over generated worlds. In a series of challenging, procedurally generated
environments, we show it is possible to achieve strong transfer performance on
held-out environments, having trained only inside a world model learned from a
narrower dataset. We believe this opens the path to utilizing larger-scale,
foundation world models for generally capable agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain of Action (CoA) framework unifies high-level planning and low-level control in a single VLA model, treating abstracted actions as intermediate reasoning steps rather than separate policy commands, achieving state-of-the-art performance in Minecraft.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The choice of action spaces is a critical unresolved challenge in developing capable agents, with no single action space being universally optimal across different tasks, creating a dilemma for building generalist agents.

Method: Introduces Chain of Action (CoA) framework that treats abstracted actions as intermediate reasoning steps guiding final executable actions. Trains an All-in-One agent on diverse mixture of action spaces using CoA paradigm.

Result: The unified agent achieves new state-of-the-art performance, improving overall task success rate over strong specialized baselines. Also releases OpenHA suite with comprehensive benchmark of 800+ tasks, datasets, code and model checkpoints.

Conclusion: CoA framework successfully resolves the action space dilemma by unifying planning and control in a single model, enabling more robust and generalizable policies through diverse action space training.

Abstract: The choice of action spaces is a critical yet unresolved challenge in
developing capable, end-to-end trainable agents. This paper first presents a
large-scale, systematic comparison of prominent abstracted action spaces and
tokenizers for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) or hierarchical agent models in the
open-ended Minecraft. Our analysis reveals that no single action space is
universally optimal; instead, the most effective abstraction is highly
task-dependent, creating a dilemma for building generalist agents. To resolve
this, we introduce Chain of Action (CoA), a novel framework that unifies
high-level planning and low-level control within a single, monolithic VLA
model. CoA treats an abstracted action not as a command for a separate policy,
but as an intermediate reasoning step--akin to a chain of thought--that guides
the generation of the final, executable action. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that an All-in-One agent trained on a diverse mixture of action spaces using
the CoA paradigm learns a more robust and generalizable policy. This unified
agent achieves a new state-of-the-art, improving the overall task success rate
over strong, specialized baselines. To foster reproducible research, we release
the OpenHA (Open Hierarchical Agents) suite, which includes our comprehensive
benchmark of over 800 distinct tasks, curated datasets, source code, and all
pretrained model checkpoints at https://github.com/CraftJarvis/OpenHA

TL;DR: PDDL-Instruct framework enhances LLMs' symbolic planning capabilities through logical chain-of-thought reasoning, achieving up to 94% planning accuracy on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with structured symbolic planning in domains requiring formal representations like PDDL, despite their impressive general capabilities.

Method: Instruction tuning framework that teaches models to reason about action applicability, state transitions, and plan validity using explicit logical inference steps and structured reflection.

Result: Models achieve up to 94% planning accuracy on standard benchmarks, representing a 66% absolute improvement over baseline models.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap between LLMs' general reasoning and logical precision required for automated planning, offering a promising direction for better AI planning systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
diverse tasks, yet their ability to perform structured symbolic planning
remains limited, particularly in domains requiring formal representations like
the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). In this paper, we present a
novel instruction tuning framework, PDDL-Instruct, designed to enhance LLMs'
symbolic planning capabilities through logical chain-of-thought reasoning. Our
approach focuses on teaching models to rigorously reason about action
applicability, state transitions, and plan validity using explicit logical
inference steps. By developing instruction prompts that guide models through
the precise logical reasoning required to determine when actions can be applied
in a given state, we enable LLMs to self-correct their planning processes
through structured reflection. The framework systematically builds verification
skills by decomposing the planning process into explicit reasoning chains about
precondition satisfaction, effect application, and invariant preservation.
Experimental results on multiple planning domains show that our
chain-of-thought reasoning based instruction-tuned models are significantly
better at planning, achieving planning accuracy of up to 94% on standard
benchmarks, representing a 66% absolute improvement over baseline models. This
work bridges the gap between the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs and the
logical precision required for automated planning, offering a promising
direction for developing better AI planning systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic UAVs framework uses LLM-driven reasoning to significantly improve UAV autonomy, achieving better detection rates and action recommendations in search-and-rescue simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UAV systems lack context-aware reasoning and autonomous decision-making, relying on rule-based control that restricts adaptability in dynamic missions. None leverage LLM agents with real-time knowledge access.

Method: Five-layer architecture (Perception, Reasoning, Action, Integration, Learning) integrating ROS2 and Gazebo with YOLOv11 object detection, GPT-4 reasoning, and local Gemma-3 deployment for LLM-driven reasoning and tool-calling capabilities.

Result: In simulated search-and-rescue: higher detection confidence (0.79 vs 0.72), improved person detection rates (91% vs 75%), and significantly increased action recommendation (92% vs 4.5%) with modest computational overhead.

Conclusion: LLM-driven reasoning enables qualitatively new levels of UAV autonomy and ecosystem integration, overcoming limitations of traditional rule-based systems.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in defense,
surveillance, and disaster response, yet most systems remain confined to SAE
Level 2--3 autonomy. Their reliance on rule-based control and narrow AI
restricts adaptability in dynamic, uncertain missions. Existing UAV frameworks
lack context-aware reasoning, autonomous decision-making, and ecosystem-level
integration; critically, none leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents with
tool-calling for real-time knowledge access. This paper introduces the Agentic
UAVs framework, a five-layer architecture (Perception, Reasoning, Action,
Integration, Learning) that augments UAVs with LLM-driven reasoning, database
querying, and third-party system interaction. A ROS2 and Gazebo-based prototype
integrates YOLOv11 object detection with GPT-4 reasoning and local Gemma-3
deployment. In simulated search-and-rescue scenarios, agentic UAVs achieved
higher detection confidence (0.79 vs. 0.72), improved person detection rates
(91% vs. 75%), and markedly increased action recommendation (92% vs. 4.5%).
These results confirm that modest computational overhead enables qualitatively
new levels of autonomy and ecosystem integration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Semantic fusion augments Transformer LMs with parallel semantic features using fuzzy membership functions, improving perplexity and enabling controllable generation with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance language models with interpretable semantic features while maintaining model simplicity and enabling user-controllable generation capabilities.

Method: Adds a parallel semantic channel with fuzzy-membership features (POS tags, roles, sentiment, etc.), fused via gated adapter. Uses next-token prediction, auxiliary reconstruction loss, and uniformizer regularization.

Result: Improves perplexity on synthetic corpus, enables precise control of polarity and punctuation in generation, maintains full compatibility with existing embeddings.

Conclusion: Semantic fusion provides an effective, lightweight approach for adding interpretable semantic conditioning to LMs while preserving model efficiency and enabling controllable generation.

Abstract: We propose semantic fusion, a lightweight scheme that augments a Transformer
language model (LM) with a parallel, fuzzy-membership feature channel that
encodes token-level semantics. Each token is represented by a vector of
interpretable features (e.g. part-of-speech cues, shallow roles, boundary
flags, sentiment polarity and strength) whose values are graded degrees from
differentiable membership functions (e.g. power kernels). These per-token
vectors form a sentence-level semantic matrix fused via a gated adapter into
the LM. Training uses standard next-token prediction, an auxiliary loss that
reconstructs the semantic features from hidden states, and a lightweight
uniformizer that regularizes adjective-class distributions. On a synthetic
two-clause corpus with held-out adjectives for out-of-distribution (OOD)
control, semantic fusion improves perplexity and enables precise,
user-controllable generation of polarity and punctuation while maintaining
model simplicity. This approach adds only small overhead, remains fully
compatible with tied input-output embeddings, and provides an interpretable
pathway for conditioned natural language generation.

TL;DR: Agent² is an automated RL agent generation framework that uses LLMs to transform natural language task descriptions into high-performance reinforcement learning solutions without human intervention, outperforming manually designed agents by up to 55%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL agent development requires extensive expertise and has high failure rates, limiting accessibility. The paper aims to automate the entire RL agent design process to make it more accessible and effective.

Method: Uses a dual-agent architecture with Generator Agent (AI designer) and Target Agent (generated RL agent). Decomposes RL development into MDP modeling and algorithmic optimization stages. Built on Model Context Protocol with adaptive training management and intelligent feedback analysis.

Result: Outperforms manually designed solutions across all tested benchmarks (MuJoCo, MetaDrive, MPE, SMAC), achieving up to 55% performance improvement and substantial average gains.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm where intelligent agents design and optimize other agents, enabling truly end-to-end, closed-loop automation for AI systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agent development traditionally requires extensive
expertise and lengthy iterations, often resulting in high failure rates and
limited accessibility. This paper introduces $Agent^2$, a novel
agent-generates-agent framework that achieves fully automated RL agent design
through intelligent LLM-driven generation. The system autonomously transforms
natural language task descriptions and environment code into comprehensive,
high-performance reinforcement learning solutions without human intervention.
$Agent^2$ features a revolutionary dual-agent architecture. The Generator Agent
serves as an autonomous AI designer that analyzes tasks and generates
executable RL agents, while the Target Agent is the resulting automatically
generated RL agent. The framework decomposes RL development into two distinct
stages: MDP modeling and algorithmic optimization, enabling more targeted and
effective agent generation. Built on the Model Context Protocol, $Agent^2$
provides a unified framework that standardizes intelligent agent creation
across diverse environments and algorithms, while incorporating adaptive
training management and intelligent feedback analysis for continuous
improvement. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmarks, including
MuJoCo, MetaDrive, MPE, and SMAC, demonstrate that $Agent^2$ consistently
outperforms manually designed solutions across all tasks, achieving up to 55%
performance improvement and substantial gains on average. By enabling truly
end-to-end, closed-loop automation, this work establishes a new paradigm in
which intelligent agents design and optimize other agents, marking a
fundamental breakthrough for automated AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLMs have advanced in visual understanding, uncertainty quantification has received insufficient attention despite being critical for reliable multimodal systems.

Method: Evaluated 16 state-of-the-art VLMs (open and closed-source) across 6 multimodal datasets using 3 distinct scoring functions for comprehensive uncertainty benchmarking.

Result: Larger models consistently exhibit better uncertainty quantification; more certain models achieve higher accuracy; mathematical and reasoning tasks show poorer uncertainty performance across all models.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for reliable uncertainty evaluation in multimodal systems, demonstrating that models that know more also know better what they don't know.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
visual understanding across scientific and reasoning tasks. While performance
benchmarking has advanced our understanding of these capabilities, the critical
dimension of uncertainty quantification has received insufficient attention.
Therefore, unlike prior conformal prediction studies that focused on limited
settings, we conduct a comprehensive uncertainty benchmarking study, evaluating
16 state-of-the-art VLMs (open and closed-source) across 6 multimodal datasets
with 3 distinct scoring functions. Our findings demonstrate that larger models
consistently exhibit better uncertainty quantification; models that know more
also know better what they don't know. More certain models achieve higher
accuracy, while mathematical and reasoning tasks elicit poorer uncertainty
performance across all models compared to other domains. This work establishes
a foundation for reliable uncertainty evaluation in multimodal systems.

TL;DR: Transformers can learn propositional STRIPS world models from action traces using next-token prediction, handling both valid and invalid action sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for learning world models from action traces without requiring explicit state information, using deep learning to capture the underlying STRIPS semantics.

Method: Cast the problem as supervised next token prediction with transformers, where actions are tokens and the model learns to predict valid action sequences based on hidden effects and preconditions.

Result: The transformer architecture can faithfully represent propositional STRIPS models and learn them from random valid and invalid action sequences.

Conclusion: Deep learning transformers are effective for learning STRIPS world models directly from action traces, demonstrating the viability of gradient-based learning for symbolic planning models.

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning propositional STRIPS world models from
action traces alone, using a deep learning architecture (transformers) and
gradient descent. The task is cast as a supervised next token prediction
problem where the tokens are the actions, and an action $a$ may follow an
action sequence if the hidden effects of the previous actions do not make an
action precondition of $a$ false. We show that a suitable transformer
architecture can faithfully represent propositional STRIPS world models, and
that the models can be learned from sets of random valid (positive) and invalid
(negative) action sequences alone. A number of experiments are reported.

TL;DR: SteeringControl is a benchmark for evaluating representation steering methods across alignment objectives like bias, harmful generation, and hallucination, while also measuring effects on secondary behaviors like sycophancy and commonsense morality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior alignment work often focuses on truthfulness or reasoning to demonstrate side effects of representation steering, but there are many unexplored tradeoffs that need systematic understanding.

Method: Created a dataset of safety-relevant behaviors and developed a modular steering framework based on unique components that serve as building blocks for existing methods. Evaluated five popular steering methods on Qwen-2.5-7B and Llama-3.1-8B models.

Result: Strong steering performance depends on the specific combination of steering method, model, and targeted behavior. Poor combinations can result in severe concept entanglement.

Conclusion: The study provides a systematic evaluation framework for representation steering methods and reveals that effectiveness is highly context-dependent, with significant potential for unintended behavioral side effects when methods are poorly matched to models and objectives.

Abstract: We introduce SteeringControl, a benchmark for evaluating representation
steering methods across core alignment objectives--bias, harmful generation,
and hallucination--and their effects on secondary behaviors such as sycophancy
and commonsense morality. While prior alignment work often highlights
truthfulness or reasoning ability to demonstrate the side effects of
representation steering, we find there are many unexplored tradeoffs not yet
understood in a systematic way. We collect a dataset of safety-relevant primary
and secondary behaviors to evaluate steering effectiveness and behavioral
entanglement centered around five popular steering methods. To enable this, we
craft a modular steering framework based on unique components that serve as the
building blocks of many existing methods. Our results on Qwen-2.5-7B and
Llama-3.1-8B find that strong steering performance is dependent on the specific
combination of steering method, model, and targeted behavior, and that severe
concept entanglement can result from poor combinations of these three as well.

TL;DR: Giving LLM agents collaborative tools like social media and journaling improves performance on hardest programming problems by 15-40% lower cost, fewer turns, and faster completion compared to baseline agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether providing LLM agents with collaborative tools and autonomy similar to human problem-solving approaches can enhance their performance on challenging tasks.

Method: Equipped Claude Code agents with MCP-based social media and journaling tools, allowing autonomous tool usage across 34 Aider Polyglot Python programming challenges, with behavioral analysis of tool interaction patterns.

Result: Collaborative tools substantially improved performance on hardest problems: 15-40% lower cost, 12-27% fewer turns, 12-38% faster completion. Different models adopted distinct strategies - Sonnet 3.7 used broad tool engagement while Sonnet 4 used selective journal-based semantic search for difficult problems.

Conclusion: AI agents can benefit from human-inspired collaboration tools at their capability limits, with structured articulation driving improvements more than information access alone, suggesting adaptive collaborative interfaces serve as reasoning enhancers rather than universal efficiency boosts.

Abstract: We investigate whether giving LLM agents the collaborative tools and autonomy
that humans naturally use for problem solving can improve their performance. We
equip Claude Code agents with MCP-based social media and journaling tools and
allow them to use these tools as they see fit. Across 34 Aider Polyglot Python
programming challenges, collaborative tools substantially improve performance
on the hardest problems, delivering 15-40% lower cost, 12-27% fewer turns, and
12-38% faster completion than baseline agents. Effects on the full challenge
set are mixed, suggesting these tools act as performance enhancers when
additional reasoning scaffolding is most needed. Surprisingly, Different models
naturally adopted distinct collaborative strategies without explicit
instruction. Sonnet 3.7 engaged broadly across tools and benefited from
articulation-based cognitive scaffolding. Sonnet 4 showed selective adoption,
leaning on journal-based semantic search when problems were genuinely
difficult. This mirrors how human developers adjust collaboration based on
expertise and task complexity. Behavioral analysis shows agents prefer writing
over reading by about 2-9x, indicating that structured articulation drives much
of the improvement rather than information access alone. Overall, AI agents can
systematically benefit from human-inspired collaboration tools at the edge of
their capabilities, pointing to adaptive collaborative interfaces as reasoning
enhancers rather than universal efficiency boosts.

Abstract: With the rapid rise of generative AI in higher education and the

Drawing on survey responses and student interviews, we analyze how students

### [139] [Programmable Cognitive Bias in Social Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13588)
*Xuan Liu,Haoyang Shang,Haojian Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoBRA is a toolkit that uses classic social science experiments to explicitly program cognitive biases in LLM-based social agents, addressing inconsistencies in natural language behavior specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional approaches using natural language descriptions fail to produce consistent agent behaviors across models and cannot capture nuanced behavioral descriptions accurately.

Method: CoBRA consists of two components: Cognitive Bias Index (measures agent's bias through validated social experiments) and Behavioral Regulation Engine (aligns agent behavior to demonstrate controlled cognitive bias).

Result: CoBRA enables precise programming of cognitive bias in social agents in a model-agnostic manner, as demonstrated through technical benchmarks and HCI toolkit evaluation.

Conclusion: The toolkit provides a systematic approach to specifying agent behavior by grounding expectations in classic social science experiments, overcoming limitations of natural language-based specifications.

Abstract: This paper introduces CoBRA, a novel toolkit for systematically specifying
agent behavior in LLM-based social simulation. We found that conventional
approaches that specify agent behaviors through implicit natural language
descriptions cannot yield consistent behaviors across models, and the produced
agent behaviors do not capture the nuances of the descriptions. In contrast,
CoBRA presents a new approach to program agents' cognitive biases explicitly,
by grounding agents' expected behaviors using classic social science
experiments. CoBRA has two components: (1) Cognitive Bias Index that measures
the cognitive bias of a social agent, by quantifying the agent's reactions in a
set of validated classical social science experiments; (2) Behavioral
Regulation Engine that aligns the agent's behavior to demonstrate controlled
cognitive bias. We evaluated CoBRA as an HCI toolkit through demonstration and
technical benchmarks. Our results suggest that CoBRA can precisely program the
cognitive bias demonstrated in a social agent in a model-agnostic manner.

*Zongru Wu,Rui Mao,Zhiyuan Tian,Pengzhou Cheng,Tianjie Ju,Zheng Wu,Lingzhong Dong,Haiyue Sheng,Zhuosheng Zhang,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of multimodal agents failing to reliably execute toggle control instructions in GUI environments. The authors create a state control benchmark and propose State-aware Reasoning (StaR), a training method that improves toggle execution accuracy by over 30% while also enhancing general task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal agents struggle with reliably executing toggle control instructions in graphical user interfaces, particularly when the current toggle state already matches the desired state. This unreliability represents a key bottleneck in GUI interaction.

Method: The authors construct a state control benchmark with binary toggle instructions from public datasets. They propose State-aware Reasoning (StaR), a training method that teaches agents to perceive current toggle state, analyze desired state from instructions, and act accordingly.

Result: Experiments show StaR improves toggle instruction execution accuracy by over 30% on three multimodal agents. Further evaluations on three public benchmarks demonstrate enhanced general task performance. Dynamic environment evaluations highlight StaR's potential for real-world applications.

Conclusion: StaR effectively addresses the toggle control reliability problem in multimodal agents, significantly improving execution accuracy while also boosting general task performance, making it suitable for real-world GUI applications.

Abstract: The advent of multimodal agents facilitates effective interaction within
graphical user interface (GUI), especially in ubiquitous GUI control. However,
their inability to reliably execute toggle control instructions remains a key
bottleneck. To investigate this, we construct a state control benchmark with
binary toggle instructions from public datasets. Evaluations of existing agents
demonstrate their unreliability, particularly when the current toggle state
already matches the desired state. To address the challenge, we propose
State-aware Reasoning (StaR), a training method that teaches agents to perceive
the current toggle state, analyze the desired state from the instruction, and
act accordingly. Experiments on three multimodal agents demonstrate that StaR
can improve toggle instruction execution accuracy by over 30\%. Further
evaluations on three public benchmarks show that StaR also enhances general
task performance. Finally, evaluations on a dynamic environment highlight the
potential of StaR for real-world applications. Code, benchmark, and
StaR-enhanced agents are available at https://github.com/ZrW00/StaR.

*Liangtao Lin,Zhaomeng Zhu,Tianwei Zhang,Yonggang Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InfraMind is a novel GUI agent framework that addresses challenges in industrial management automation by combining systematic exploration, memory-driven planning, state identification, knowledge distillation, and multi-layered safety mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial infrastructure management faces challenges from system complexity, multi-vendor integration, and operator shortages. Existing RPA solutions lack flexibility and have high maintenance costs, while general-purpose LLM-based GUI agents struggle with industrial-specific requirements.

Method: InfraMind integrates five modules: (1) systematic search-based exploration with virtual machine snapshots for GUI understanding, (2) memory-driven planning for precision and efficiency, (3) advanced state identification for hierarchical interfaces, (4) structured knowledge distillation for lightweight deployment, and (5) multi-layered safety mechanisms.

Result: Extensive experiments on open-source and commercial DCIM platforms show InfraMind consistently outperforms existing frameworks in task success rate and operational efficiency.

Conclusion: InfraMind provides a rigorous and scalable solution for industrial management automation by specifically addressing the unique challenges of industrial GUI systems through its integrated framework approach.

Abstract: Mission-critical industrial infrastructure, such as data centers,
increasingly depends on complex management software. Its operations, however,
pose significant challenges due to the escalating system complexity,
multi-vendor integration, and a shortage of expert operators. While Robotic
Process Automation (RPA) offers partial automation through handcrafted scripts,
it suffers from limited flexibility and high maintenance costs. Recent advances
in Large Language Model (LLM)-based graphical user interface (GUI) agents have
enabled more flexible automation, yet these general-purpose agents face five
critical challenges when applied to industrial management, including unfamiliar
element understanding, precision and efficiency, state localization, deployment
constraints, and safety requirements. To address these issues, we propose
InfraMind, a novel exploration-based GUI agentic framework specifically
tailored for industrial management systems. InfraMind integrates five
innovative modules to systematically resolve different challenges in industrial
management: (1) systematic search-based exploration with virtual machine
snapshots for autonomous understanding of complex GUIs; (2) memory-driven
planning to ensure high-precision and efficient task execution; (3) advanced
state identification for robust localization in hierarchical interfaces; (4)
structured knowledge distillation for efficient deployment with lightweight
models; and (5) comprehensive, multi-layered safety mechanisms to safeguard
sensitive operations. Extensive experiments on both open-source and commercial
DCIM platforms demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing
frameworks in terms of task success rate and operational efficiency, providing
a rigorous and scalable solution for industrial management automation.

### [142] [THOR: Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL for Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13761)
*Qikai Chang,Zhenrong Zhang,Pengfei Hu,Jiefeng Ma,Yicheng Pan,Jianshu Zhang,Jun Du,Quan Liu,Jianqing Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: THOR is a tool-integrated hierarchical optimization framework that uses RL to improve LLMs' mathematical reasoning by generating high-quality tool-integrated datasets, performing fine-grained optimization, and enabling self-correction during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with high-precision mathematical tasks like numerical computation and symbolic manipulation, and existing tool integration methods face challenges with data construction, fine-grained optimization, and inference enhancement.

Method: Proposes THOR with three components: 1) TIRGen - multi-agent actor-critic pipeline for generating tool-integrated reasoning datasets, 2) RL strategy for joint trajectory-level and step-level optimization, 3) self-correction mechanism using tool feedback during inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple mathematical benchmarks for similar-scale models, shows strong generalization across diverse models, and delivers consistent improvements on code benchmarks.

Conclusion: THOR effectively bridges LLMs' precision gap in mathematical reasoning through hierarchical optimization and tool integration, demonstrating broad applicability and superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in mathematical
reasoning, but still continue to struggle with high-precision tasks like
numerical computation and formal symbolic manipulation. Integrating external
tools has emerged as a promising approach to bridge this gap. Despite recent
advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: constructing
tool-integrated reasoning data, performing fine-grained optimization, and
enhancing inference. To overcome these limitations, we propose THOR
(Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL). First, we introduce TIRGen,
a multi-agent actor-critic-based pipeline for constructing high-quality
datasets of tool-integrated reasoning paths, aligning with the policy and
generalizing well across diverse models. Second, to perform fine-grained
hierarchical optimization, we introduce an RL strategy that jointly optimizes
for both trajectory-level problem solving and step-level code generation. This
is motivated by our key insight that the success of an intermediate tool call
is a strong predictor of the final answer's correctness. Finally, THOR
incorporates a self-correction mechanism that leverages immediate tool feedback
to dynamically revise erroneous reasoning paths during inference. Our approach
demonstrates strong generalization across diverse models, performing
effectively in both reasoning and non-reasoning models. It further achieves
state-of-the-art performance for models of a similar scale on multiple
mathematical benchmarks, while also delivering consistent improvements on code
benchmarks. Our code will be publicly available at
https://github.com/JingMog/THOR.

to extract key entities, infer user intent, and generate precise instructions;
2) A template-augmented reasoning mechanism that integrates high-level
reasoning templates, enhancing task inference accuracy; 3) A prefix-tree-based
constrained decoding strategy that restricts outputs to predefined instruction
candidates, ensuring coherent and intent-aligned suggestions. Through
evaluation using a real-world annotated datasets and a user study, MIRA has
demonstrated substantial improvements in the accuracy of instruction
recommendation. The encouraging results highlight MIRA's potential to
revolutionize the way users engage with AI services on their smartphones,
offering a more seamless and efficient experience.

*Mingwei Zhang,Zhenhao Gu,Liangda Fang,Cunjing Ge,Ziliang Chen,Zhao-Rong Lai,Quanlong Guan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An exact approach for model counting over integer linear constraints using DPLL architecture with mixed integer programming simplification techniques, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear constraints are fundamental in computer science, operations research, and optimization, with many applications requiring model counting over integer linear constraints (MCILC).

Method: Exhaustive DPLL architecture integrated with effective simplification techniques from mixed integer programming.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art MCILC counters and propositional model counters on 2840 random benchmarks (solved 1718 vs 1470) and solved all 4131 application instances.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly improves efficiency and is the only method capable of solving all application instances.

Abstract: Linear constraints are one of the most fundamental constraints in fields such
as computer science, operations research and optimization. Many applications
reduce to the task of model counting over integer linear constraints (MCILC).
In this paper, we design an exact approach to MCILC based on an exhaustive DPLL
architecture. To improve the efficiency, we integrate several effective
simplification techniques from mixed integer programming into the architecture.
We compare our approach to state-of-the-art MCILC counters and propositional
model counters on 2840 random and 4131 application benchmarks. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly outperforms all exact methods in
random benchmarks solving 1718 instances while the state-of-the-art approach
only computes 1470 instances. In addition, our approach is the only approach to
solve all 4131 application instances.

### [145] [Exploring Major Transitions in the Evolution of Biological Cognition With Artificial Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13968)
*Konstantinos Voudouris,Andrew Barron,Marta Halina,Colin Klein,Matishalin Patel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether changes in neural network topology can create major transitions in cognitive performance, similar to evolutionary transitions. Using ANNs with different architectures, they found recurrent networks show qualitative performance improvements over feed-forward networks in complex grammar learning, demonstrating transitional cognitive changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether cognition might have evolved through major transitions that fundamentally change information flow in neural networks, similar to evolutionary transitions that shape biological lineages.

Method: Used artificial neural networks (ANNs) with feed-forward, recurrent, and laminated topologies to compare performance on learning artificial grammars of varying complexity, while controlling for network size and resources.

Result: Recurrent networks showed qualitative expansion in processing capabilities and performance improvements for complex grammars compared to feed-forward networks. Training difficulty of recurrent networks created transition barriers. Laminated networks did not outperform non-laminated ones in grammar learning.

Conclusion: Some changes in information flow (specifically from feed-forward to recurrent architectures) can yield transitional changes in cognitive performance, supporting the idea that cognition may have evolved through major transitions in neural network structure.

Abstract: Transitional accounts of evolution emphasise a few changes that shape what is
evolvable, with dramatic consequences for derived lineages. More recently it
has been proposed that cognition might also have evolved via a series of major
transitions that manipulate the structure of biological neural networks,
fundamentally changing the flow of information. We used idealised models of
information flow, artificial neural networks (ANNs), to evaluate whether
changes in information flow in a network can yield a transitional change in
cognitive performance. We compared networks with feed-forward, recurrent and
laminated topologies, and tested their performance learning artificial grammars
that differed in complexity, controlling for network size and resources. We
documented a qualitative expansion in the types of input that recurrent
networks can process compared to feed-forward networks, and a related
qualitative increase in performance for learning the most complex grammars. We
also noted how the difficulty in training recurrent networks poses a form of
transition barrier and contingent irreversibility -- other key features of
evolutionary transitions. Not all changes in network topology confer a
performance advantage in this task set. Laminated networks did not outperform
non-laminated networks in grammar learning. Overall, our findings show how some
changes in information flow can yield transitions in cognitive performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CrowdAgent is a multi-agent system that provides end-to-end process control for data annotation by dynamically managing LLMs, SLMs, and human experts with optimized task assignment and quality-cost trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NLP annotation methods focus narrowly on labeling but lack holistic process control to manage diverse annotation sources (LLMs, SLMs, humans) dynamically with proper scheduling and quality-cost optimization.

Method: Introduces CrowdAgent, a multi-agent system inspired by crowdsourcing companies that integrates task assignment, data annotation, and quality/cost management in a unified framework with rational task allocation.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through extensive experiments on six diverse multimodal classification tasks, showing improved annotation workflow with synergistic collaboration between different annotation sources.

Conclusion: CrowdAgent provides a comprehensive solution for end-to-end annotation process control, enabling efficient and cost-effective data annotation by leveraging the complementary strengths of LLMs, SLMs, and human experts.

Abstract: High-quality annotated data is a cornerstone of modern Natural Language
Processing (NLP). While recent methods begin to leverage diverse annotation
sources-including Large Language Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs),
and human experts-they often focus narrowly on the labeling step itself. A
critical gap remains in the holistic process control required to manage these
sources dynamically, addressing complex scheduling and quality-cost trade-offs
in a unified manner. Inspired by real-world crowdsourcing companies, we
introduce CrowdAgent, a multi-agent system that provides end-to-end process
control by integrating task assignment, data annotation, and quality/cost
management. It implements a novel methodology that rationally assigns tasks,
enabling LLMs, SLMs, and human experts to advance synergistically in a
collaborative annotation workflow. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CrowdAgent through extensive experiments on six diverse multimodal
classification tasks. The source code and video demo are available at

### [147] [Hierarchical Learning for Maze Navigation: Emergence of Mental Representations via Second-Order Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14195)
*Shalima Binta Manir,Tim Oates*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Second-order learning (adapting first-order learning mechanisms) promotes mental representations that mirror environmental structure, validated through a GCN-MLP hierarchical architecture for maze navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically validate the hypothesis that second-order learning facilitates the emergence of structured mental representations isomorphic to external environments, which is fundamental to advanced cognition but challenging to study.

Method: A hierarchical architecture with Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) as first-order learner for path prediction and MLP controller as second-order learner that dynamically adapts GCN parameters when facing novel maze environments.

Result: Second-order learning is most effective when cognitive systems develop internal mental maps structurally isomorphic to the environment, showing significant performance improvements and robust generalization on unseen maze tasks.

Conclusion: The study provides empirical evidence supporting the critical role of structured mental representations in maximizing second-order learning effectiveness, demonstrating environment-cognition isomorphism through quantitative and qualitative results.

Abstract: Mental representation, characterized by structured internal models mirroring
external environments, is fundamental to advanced cognition but remains
challenging to investigate empirically. Existing theory hypothesizes that
second-order learning -- learning mechanisms that adapt first-order learning
(i.e., learning about the task/domain) -- promotes the emergence of such
environment-cognition isomorphism. In this paper, we empirically validate this
hypothesis by proposing a hierarchical architecture comprising a Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) as a first-order learner and an MLP controller as a
second-order learner. The GCN directly maps node-level features to predictions
of optimal navigation paths, while the MLP dynamically adapts the GCN's
parameters when confronting structurally novel maze environments. We
demonstrate that second-order learning is particularly effective when the
cognitive system develops an internal mental map structurally isomorphic to the
environment. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight significant
performance improvements and robust generalization on unseen maze tasks,
providing empirical support for the pivotal role of structured mental
representations in maximizing the effectiveness of second-order learning.
