In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive\nbenchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k\nimage-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four\ncategories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category\nenriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into\nthree main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs.\nUsing 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we\nevaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept\ninjection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings\nindicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with\npersonalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue,\nhandling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals\nthat the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and\nlong-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By\nidentifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers\nvaluable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly\npersonalized multi-modal AI.

With the rapid progress in\nMultimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this\nlong-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image\n(T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant\nperformance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other\nthan the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of\nReference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE),\nan extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework\nfor T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially\ngenerated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference\nspecified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the\nspatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial\nexpression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective\nenables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When\nmisalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and\napplied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing\ndirection and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two\nbenchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our\nframework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3%\nusing only a single round of correction.", "AI": {"tldr": "FoR-SALE is a framework that improves text-to-image generation by incorporating Frame of Reference concepts to better handle spatial descriptions from different perspectives, using vision modules and latent-space operations to correct misalignments.", "motivation": "Current text-to-image models struggle with spatial descriptions from perspectives other than the camera view, creating a need to integrate Frame of Reference concepts for better spatial reasoning.", "method": "Extends SLD framework by evaluating text-image alignment using Frame of Reference, extracts spatial configuration from images, maps spatial expressions to camera perspectives, and applies latent-space operations to adjust facing direction and depth.", "result": "Improves state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3% on spatial understanding benchmarks using only a single correction round.", "conclusion": "FoR-SALE successfully integrates Frame of Reference into multimodal models, significantly enhancing their ability to handle complex spatial descriptions from various viewpoints."}}
