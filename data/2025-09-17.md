*Mustafa Khanbhai,Giulia Di Nardo,Jun Ma,Vivienne Freitas,Caterina Masino,Ali Dolatabadi,Zhaoxun "Lorenz" Liu,Wey Leong,Wagner H. Souza,Amin Madani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel human-in-the-loop machine learning approach using U-Mamba for 3D anatomical segmentation and reconstruction, achieving high accuracy (DSC 0.82-0.97) and improving surgical planning and patient education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional segmentation models struggle with generalization across diverse datasets for preoperative planning, requiring more accurate and generalizable algorithms for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond breast cancer applications.

Method: Processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs through anonymization, manual segmentation of T1-weighted and contrast-enhanced sequences, co-registration, segmentation of breast structures, and 3D visualization using ITK-SNAP. Used human-in-the-loop approach with U-Mamba model to refine segmentations and improve generalization.

Result: U-Mamba achieved DSC values of 0.97 (±0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 (±0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and 0.82 (±0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. Generated accurate 3D reconstructions and received positive feedback from clinicians for improved planning and navigation.

Conclusion: The human-in-the-loop machine learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and anatomical segmentation, offering enhanced visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more effective patient education across medical applications.

Abstract: Effective preoperative planning requires accurate algorithms for segmenting
anatomical structures across diverse datasets, but traditional models struggle
with generalization. This study presents a novel machine learning methodology
to improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond
breast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January
2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of
T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and
segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D
visualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined
segmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios.
Dice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and
ground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient
interviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97
($\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and
0.82 ($\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate
3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features.
Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation,
and decision support. Integration of 3D visualization enhanced patient
education, communication, and understanding. This human-in-the-loop machine
learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and
anatomical segmentation across patient datasets, offering enhanced
visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more
effective patient education, facilitating shared decision-making and empowering
informed patient choices across medical applications.

### [2] [RU-Net for Automatic Characterization of TRISO Fuel Cross Sections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12244)
*Lu Cai,Fei Xu,Min Xian,Yalei Tang,Shoukun Sun,John Stempien*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment microscopic images of irradiated TRISO particle fuel layers, with RU-Net achieving the best performance in IoU metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual analysis of thousands of TRISO particles in fuel compacts is cumbersome and subjective. Automated segmentation is needed to reduce subjectivity and accelerate data analysis of irradiation-induced morphological changes.

Method: Generated a dataset of 2,000+ microscopic images of cross-sectional TRISO particles with annotations. Tested multiple CNN architectures including RU-Net (newly developed), U-Net, ResNet, and Attention U-Net for automatic layer segmentation.

Result: Preliminary results show that the RU-Net based model performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU) metric for segmenting different TRISO layers.

Conclusion: CNN models can significantly expedite TRISO particle analysis, reduce manual labor, and improve objectivity of segmentation results for irradiation-induced morphological changes.

Abstract: During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer
densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO)
particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these
irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally
contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get
statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To
reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data
analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment
cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of
machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured
grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable
performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification,
object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a
large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of
cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based
on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment
different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as
well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and
Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net
performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we
can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly
reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the
segmentation results.

*Abigail R. Cohen,Yuming Sun,Zhihao Qin,Harsh S. Muriki,Zihao Xiao,Yeonju Lee,Matthew Housley,Andrew F. Sharkey,Rhuanito S. Ferrarezi,Jing Li,Lu Gan,Yongsheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A tiered pipeline using multispectral imaging and autoencoders for efficient nutrient anomaly detection and crop status estimation, balancing accuracy with energy efficiency for sustainable agriculture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current nutrient management approaches require lengthy analyses preventing real-time optimization, and imaging-based phenotyping is computationally intensive for resource-constrained environments.

Method: Hierarchical pipeline using autoencoder for early anomaly detection, comparing vegetation index features with Random Forest vs raw whole-image Vision Transformer for detailed nutrient status estimation across three fertilizer treatments.

Result: 73% net detection of severely nutrient-deficient samples 9 days after transplanting at lower energy cost than wasted nitrogen; ViT outperformed RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R² 0.61 vs 0.58, 0.48 vs 0.35) but with higher energy consumption.

Conclusion: The modular pipeline enables edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural sustainability by providing flexible trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy in nutrient management.

Abstract: Efficient nutrient management is critical for crop growth and sustainable
resource consumption (e.g., nitrogen, energy). Current approaches require
lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging
facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing
deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered
pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass,
and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches
that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion
experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer
strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline
using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status
estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis:
vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and
raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated
high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after
transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted
nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming
RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at
higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities
for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural
sustainability.

### [4] [Humor in Pixels: Benchmarking Large Multimodal Models Understanding of Online Comics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12248)
*Yuriel Ryan,Rui Yang Tan,Kenny Tsu Wei Choo,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelHumor is a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics to evaluate Large Multimodal Models' ability to understand multimodal humor and narrative sequences, revealing significant performance gaps compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humor understanding is a core aspect of social intelligence but remains a significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), highlighting the need for better evaluation frameworks.

Method: Created PixelHumor benchmark with 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics and conducted experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs to evaluate their performance on humor interpretation and narrative sequencing tasks.

Result: Top LMMs achieved only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing (far below human performance), revealing substantial gaps in multimodal integration and humor understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: Current LMMs have critical limitations in integrating visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor understanding, and PixelHumor provides a rigorous framework to drive development of more socially aware LMMs.

Abstract: Understanding humor is a core aspect of social intelligence, yet it remains a
significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We introduce
PixelHumor, a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics designed
to evaluate LMMs' ability to interpret multimodal humor and recognize narrative
sequences. Experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial gaps: for
instance, top models achieve only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, far below
human performance. This underscores critical limitations in current models'
integration of visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor
understanding. By providing a rigorous framework for evaluating multimodal
contextual and narrative reasoning, PixelHumor aims to drive the development of
LMMs that better engage in natural, socially aware interactions.

### [5] [OnlineHOI: Towards Online Human-Object Interaction Generation and Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12250)
*Yihong Ji,Yunze Liu,Yiyao Zhuo,Weijiang Yu,Fei Ma,Joshua Huang,Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes OnlineHOI framework for real-time human-object interaction tasks using Mamba architecture with memory mechanism, achieving SOTA results on online generation and perception tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HOI methods work offline using full sequence data, but real-world applications require online processing with only current and historical information available at each time step.

Method: OnlineHOI framework based on Mamba architecture with memory mechanism to handle streaming data and efficiently integrate historical information for online processing.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as well as online HOI4D perception task.

Conclusion: The proposed online approach significantly outperforms offline methods in real-time HOI scenarios, demonstrating the importance of specialized architectures for streaming data applications.

Abstract: The perception and generation of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) are crucial
for fields such as robotics, AR/VR, and human behavior understanding. However,
current approaches model this task in an offline setting, where information at
each time step can be drawn from the entire interaction sequence. In contrast,
in real-world scenarios, the information available at each time step comes only
from the current moment and historical data, i.e., an online setting. We find
that offline methods perform poorly in an online context. Based on this
observation, we propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception. To
address this task, we introduce the OnlineHOI framework, a network architecture
based on the Mamba framework that employs a memory mechanism. By leveraging
Mamba's powerful modeling capabilities for streaming data and the Memory
mechanism's efficient integration of historical information, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on the Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as
well as the online HOI4D perception task.

### [6] [EfficientNet-Based Multi-Class Detection of Real, Deepfake, and Plastic Surgery Faces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12258)
*Li Kun,Milena Radenkovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning enables advanced deepfake technology that creates realistic fake media, posing serious threats to privacy, reputation, national security, and democratic processes through face-swapping and political manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the dual nature of deep learning technology - while it brings progress in computer vision and revolutionary applications, it also enables harmful deepfake technology that negatively impacts society through privacy violations, reputation damage, and political manipulation.

Method: The paper analyzes how deepfake technology leverages deep learning advancements to create indistinguishable counterfeit photographs and films, specifically examining face-swapping programs and their applications in misleading users and manipulating political campaigns.

Result: Deepfake technology presents significant risks including impairment of facial recognition systems, appropriation of personal information, sabotage of election campaigns, and damage to political and economic structures through deceptive imagery that influences public perception.

Conclusion: The improper application of deepfake technology produces detrimental societal effects, demonstrating that while deep learning offers benefits, its misuse through deepfakes poses serious threats to privacy, security, and democratic institutions that require attention and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Currently, deep learning has been utilised to tackle several difficulties in
our everyday lives. It not only exhibits progress in computer vision but also
constitutes the foundation for several revolutionary technologies. Nonetheless,
similar to all phenomena, the use of deep learning in diverse domains has
produced a multifaceted interaction of advantages and disadvantages for human
society. Deepfake technology has advanced, significantly impacting social life.
However, developments in this technology can affect privacy, the reputations of
prominent personalities, and national security via software development. It can
produce indistinguishable counterfeit photographs and films, potentially
impairing the functionality of facial recognition systems, so presenting a
significant risk.
  The improper application of deepfake technology produces several detrimental
effects on society. Face-swapping programs mislead users by altering persons'
appearances or expressions to fulfil particular aims or to appropriate personal
information. Deepfake technology permeates daily life through such techniques.
Certain individuals endeavour to sabotage election campaigns or subvert
prominent political figures by creating deceptive pictures to influence public
perception, causing significant harm to a nation's political and economic
structure.

### [7] [A Modern Look at Simplicity Bias in Image Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12265)
*Xiaoguang Chang,Teng Wang,Changyin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the simplicity bias (SB) in CLIP models and its relationship with performance across various image classification tasks, proposing a new frequency-aware measure for better SB assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on neural network simplicity bias focus on simple models or synthetic tasks, making it challenging to measure SB in large models like CLIP and understand its relevance to real-world image classification tasks.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze limitations of existing complexity measures, propose a frequency-aware measure for finer-grained SB differences, validate it on CLIP models with SB-modulation methods, and examine SB-performance relationships across zero-shot and fine-tuning settings.

Result: The proposed frequency-aware measure is more informative and consistent than previous measures. Experiments show varying behaviors - stronger SB correlates better with out-of-distribution generalization than adversarial robustness.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the importance of aligning a model's inductive biases with target task characteristics, highlighting how simplicity bias affects performance differently across various image classification scenarios.

Abstract: The simplicity Bias (SB) of neural networks, i.e.\ their tendency to
represent simple functions, is a key factor in their generalization
capabilities. Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on
complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these
studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to
measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the
SB to various image classification tasks.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models
and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we
theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of
complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this,
we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We
validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation
methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous
measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and
their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of
behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on
OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the
benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the
target task.

### [8] [GraphDerm: Fusing Imaging, Physical Scale, and Metadata in a Population-Graph Classifier for Dermoscopic Lesions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12277)
*Mehdi Yousefzadeh,Parsa Esfahanian,Sara Rashidifar,Hossein Salahshoor Gavalan,Negar Sadat Rafiee Tabatabaee,Saeid Gorgin,Dara Rahmati,Maryam Daneshpazhooh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GraphDerm is a graph neural network framework that combines dermoscopic images with patient metadata and physical scale calibration for improved melanoma classification, outperforming image-only AI approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image-only AI for dermoscopy ignores important patient metadata (age, sex, site) and lacks physical scale calibration needed for geometric analysis of lesions, limiting diagnostic accuracy.

Method: Uses U-Nets for lesion and ruler segmentation, regresses pixels-per-millimeter from ruler masks, computes real-scale geometric descriptors, and employs a spectral GNN with EfficientNet-B3 features and metadata/geometry-based edges for semi-supervised classification.

Result: Achieves AUC of 0.9812 for classification, significantly outperforming the image-only baseline (AUC 0.9440). Sparse graphs using 25% of edges maintain near-optimal performance (AUC 0.9788). Scale regression achieves MAE of 1.5 pixels.

Conclusion: Integrating calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in population graphs provides substantial improvements over image-only methods. Sparse graphs enable efficient deployment, making scale-aware graph-based AI promising for dermoscopic decision support.

Abstract: Introduction. Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often
ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for
geometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that
fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass
dermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale
application of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,
synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets
(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are
regressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.
From lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of
gyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry
similarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs
semi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.
Results. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale
regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a
thresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440
for the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99
range. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in
a population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on
ISIC-2019. Sparser graphs retain near-optimal accuracy, suggesting efficient
deployment. Scale-aware, graph-based AI is a promising direction for
dermoscopic decision support; future work will refine learned edge semantics
and evaluate on broader curated benchmarks.

### [9] [PATIMT-Bench: A Multi-Scenario Benchmark for Position-Aware Text Image Machine Translation in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12278)
*Wanru Zhuang,Wenbo Li,Zhibin Lan,Xu Han,Peng Li,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces position-aware text image machine translation (PATIMT) that provides fine-grained, layout-preserving translations with bounding boxes, addressing limitations of current TIMT approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TIMT methods only translate all text in images without providing bounding boxes and cover limited scenarios, lacking practical fine-grained translation capabilities.

Method: Proposes PATIMT with two sub-tasks: region-specific translation and full-image translation with grounding. Constructs PATIMTBench benchmark with 10 real-world scenarios using Adaptive Image OCR Refinement Pipeline and 1,200 manually annotated test instances.

Result: Compact Large Vision-Language Models achieve state-of-the-art performance on both sub-tasks after fine-tuning on the constructed data, demonstrating scalability and generalizability.

Conclusion: The proposed PATIMT framework and benchmark successfully address the limitations of traditional TIMT, enabling practical fine-grained and layout-preserving translation with reliable evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded within
an image into another language. Current TIMT studies primarily focus on
providing translations for all the text within an image, while neglecting to
provide bounding boxes and covering limited scenarios. In this work, we extend
traditional TIMT into position-aware TIMT (PATIMT), aiming to support
fine-grained and layoutpreserving translation, which holds great practical
value but remains largely unexplored. This task comprises two key sub-tasks:
regionspecific translation and full-image translation with grounding. To
support existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the
PATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world
scenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement
Pipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and
refines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we
further construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances
manually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our
data, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both sub-tasks. Experimental results also highlight the
scalability and generalizability of our training data

### [10] [Domain Adaptive SAR Wake Detection: Leveraging Similarity Filtering and Memory Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12279)
*He Gao,Baoxiang Huang,Milena Radenkovic,Borui Li,Ge Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel domain adaptation framework called SimMemDA for cross-modal ship wake detection that uses similarity-guided filtering and memory-guided pseudo-label calibration to bridge the gap between optical and SAR images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR images are crucial for wake detection but suffer from abstract/noisy features making annotation difficult. Optical images provide clearer visual cues but models trained on optical data degrade when applied to SAR due to domain shift.

Method: Uses WakeGAN for style transfer to generate SAR-like pseudo-images, instance-level feature similarity filtering to prioritize target-like samples, and a Feature-Confidence Memory Bank with KNN confidence-weighted fusion to dynamically calibrate pseudo-labels. Also employs region-mixed training combining source annotations with calibrated target pseudo-labels.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and robustness in cross-modal ship wake detection tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed SimMemDA method effectively addresses the cross-modal domain adaptation challenge between optical and SAR images for wake detection, validating its effectiveness and feasibility.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its all-weather and wide-area
observation capabilities, serves as a crucial tool for wake detection. However,
due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear
abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast,
optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical
data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to
domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we
propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adaptation (termed
SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via
instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance.
Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR
images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images,
generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature
similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source
samples with target-like distributions, minimizing negative transfer.
Meanwhile, a Feature-Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor
confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate
pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of
pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through
region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with
calibrated target pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed SimMemDA method can improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal
ship wake detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the
proposed method.

### [11] [Uncertainty-Aware Hourly Air Temperature Mapping at 2 km Resolution via Physics-Guided Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12329)
*Shengjie Kris Liu,Siqin Wang,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning approach called Amplifier Air-Transformer generates hourly 2km resolution air temperature data over the contiguous US by reconstructing cloud-obscured satellite surface temperatures and transforming them to air temperature using neural networks with physics guidance and uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No single data source provides seamless spatiotemporal air temperature data - weather stations offer continuous monitoring but limited spatial coverage, while satellites provide broad coverage but with gaps due to clouds.

Method: Two-stage neural network approach: 1) Reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured by clouds using neural network encoded with annual temperature cycle, linear amplification of ERA5 data, and convolutional layers for spatiotemporal variations. 2) Transforms surface temperature to air temperature using another neural network leveraging Earth surface properties. Enhanced with deep ensemble learning for uncertainty estimation.

Result: Built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature pixels and 155 million air temperature records (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping accuracy of 1.93°C in station-based validation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction, enabling seamless high-resolution temperature monitoring that can be extended to other satellite sources.

Abstract: Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's
surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites
provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a
spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep
learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution
over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier
Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured
by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual
temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature
values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal
variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface
temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key
Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive
uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.
The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature
pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the
contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping
accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach
streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction,
and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature
monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution. The generated data of this study
can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15252812, and the project

### [12] [DS@GT AnimalCLEF: Triplet Learning over ViT Manifolds with Nearest Neighbor Classification for Animal Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12353)
*Anthony Miyaguchi,Chandrasekaran Maruthaiyannan,Charles R. Clark*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Post-hoc metric learning effectiveness depends on backbone embedding quality and domain-specificity. Domain-specific MegaDescriptor outperforms general-purpose DINOv2 for animal re-identification, with minimal gains from metric learning on general-purpose features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how the effectiveness of post-hoc metric learning depends on the initial quality and domain-specificity of backbone embeddings for animal re-identification tasks, comparing general-purpose vs domain-specific models.

Method: Used DINOv2 (general-purpose) and MegaDescriptor (domain-specific) as backbone models, applied K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding for identification, and tested triplet-learning projection head for metric learning improvements.

Result: Triplet-learning improved MegaDescriptor by 0.13 points but only 0.03 for DINOv2 on averaged BAKS and BAUS metrics. General-purpose manifold proved difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks with stagnant validation loss.

Conclusion: General-purpose features have critical limitations for specialized re-ID tasks with limited data. Domain-specific pre-training is crucial, as general-purpose manifolds are resistant to post-hoc refinement for fine-grained recognition.

Abstract: This paper details the DS@GT team's entry for the AnimalCLEF 2025
re-identification challenge. Our key finding is that the effectiveness of
post-hoc metric learning is highly contingent on the initial quality and
domain-specificity of the backbone embeddings. We compare a general-purpose
model (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as a backbone. A
K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known
individuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head
improved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13
points, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on
averaged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is
more difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant
validation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the
critical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized,
limited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific
pre-training. The implementation for this work is publicly available at

*Florian Zager,Hamza A. A. Gardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GhostNetV3-Small outperforms original GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10 with 93.94% accuracy, showing architectural adaptation beats knowledge distillation for low-resolution image tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable efficient neural network deployment on resource-constrained edge devices by compressing and adapting models for low-resolution inputs.

Method: Proposed GhostNetV3-Small architecture optimized for CIFAR-10, and compared traditional knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles.

Result: GhostNetV3-Small achieved 93.94% accuracy on CIFAR-10, outperforming original GhostNetV3. All distillation techniques reduced accuracy compared to baseline training.

Conclusion: Architectural adaptation is more effective than distillation for small-scale image classification, indicating need for better model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a range of
tasks, however their computational demands often make them unsuitable for
deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper explores strategies
for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such
environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for
mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed
to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10
dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative
evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional
knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental
results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original
GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to
expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy
compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural
adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image
classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective
model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Raw UAV imagery outperforms orthomosaics for palm tree detection and localization in tropical forests, with crown-center annotations further improving accuracy for ecological monitoring applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Orthomosaic imagery from UAVs has stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing that limit field deployment suitability, while raw UAV imagery may offer better performance for tree mapping in ecological monitoring.

Method: Used state-of-the-art detectors and keypoint models to compare detection performance between orthomosaic and raw UAV imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain transfer scenarios, and evaluated crown-center annotations vs bounding-box centroids.

Result: Raw imagery yields superior performance in deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust cross-domain generalization. Crown-center annotations improve localization accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids.

Conclusion: Raw UAV imagery with crown-center annotations provides practical guidance for UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring, offering precise tree positions for downstream ecological analyses.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is essential for ecological monitoring
and forest management. Orthomosaic imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
is widely used, but stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing limit its
suitability for field deployment. This study explores the use of raw UAV
imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests.
Two research questions are addressed: (1) how detection performance varies
across orthomosaic and raw imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain
transfer, and (2) to what extent crown-center annotations improve localization
accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids. Using state-of-the-art detectors and
keypoint models, we show that raw imagery yields superior performance in
deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust
cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations in training
further improves localization and provides precise tree positions for
downstream ecological analyses. These findings offer practical guidance for
UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring.

*Mayank Patel,Rahul Jain,Asim Unmesh,Karthik Ramani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MechBench benchmark dataset and DYNAMO neural model for predicting coupled mechanical motion in gear assemblies from static CAD geometry without joint annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for articulated objects rely on simplified kinematics or joint annotations, but mechanical assemblies like gears have motion arising from geometric coupling through meshing teeth or aligned axes, which is difficult to reason about from geometry alone.

Method: Created MechBench dataset with 693 synthetic gear assemblies and ground-truth motion trajectories. Proposed DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories from segmented CAD point clouds.

Result: DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving accurate and temporally consistent motion predictions across varied gear configurations.

Conclusion: MechBench and DYNAMO establish a systematic framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD assemblies, addressing the challenge of predicting motion from geometric coupling rather than predefined joints.

Abstract: Understanding the motion of articulated mechanical assemblies from static
geometry remains a core challenge in 3D perception and design automation. Prior
work on everyday articulated objects such as doors and laptops typically
assumes simplified kinematic structures or relies on joint annotations.
However, in mechanical assemblies like gears, motion arises from geometric
coupling, through meshing teeth or aligned axes, making it difficult for
existing methods to reason about relational motion from geometry alone. To
address this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diverse
synthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories.
MechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where part
dynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints.
Building on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that
predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point
clouds. Experiments show that DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving
accurate and temporally consistent predictions across varied gear
configurations. Together, MechBench and DYNAMO establish a novel systematic
framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD
assemblies.

Conclusion: Cott-ADNet provides an accurate and efficient solution for in-field deployment, serving as a reliable basis for automated cotton harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis.

Abstract: Cotton is one of the most important natural fiber crops worldwide, yet
harvesting remains limited by labor-intensive manual picking, low efficiency,
and yield losses from missing the optimal harvest window. Accurate recognition
of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield
estimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight
real-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex
field conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial
representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while
introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to
better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field
SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling
at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and
release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future
research. Experiments show that Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8%
Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs,
maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations.
These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for
in-field deployment, and thus provide a reliable basis for automated cotton

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A meta-review of deep learning approaches for point cloud processing applications, analyzing practical challenges like large data volumes, diverse scenes, and varying densities that existing surveys often overlook.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surveys focus mainly on network architectures for unordered point clouds but ignore practical implementation challenges in real-world applications where factors like extra-large data volumes, diverse scene contents, varying point density, and multi-modal data need consideration.

Method: The paper conducts a meta-review of deep learning approaches and datasets covering critical point cloud processing tasks including scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and modeling, while examining their application in urban and environmental contexts.

Result: The review identifies significant gaps that need to be addressed as these deep learning methods transition into practical applications, highlighting both algorithmic and practical limitations.

Conclusion: The paper provides concluding remarks on both algorithmic and practical aspects of surveyed methods, emphasizing the need to bridge the gap between theoretical deep learning approaches and real-world point cloud processing applications.

Abstract: Point cloud processing as a fundamental task in the field of geomatics and
computer vision, has been supporting tasks and applications at different scales
from air to ground, including mapping, environmental monitoring, urban/tree
structure modeling, automated driving, robotics, disaster responses etc. Due to
the rapid development of deep learning, point cloud processing algorithms have
nowadays been almost explicitly dominated by learning-based approaches, most of
which are yet transitioned into real-world practices. Existing surveys
primarily focus on the ever-updating network architecture to accommodate
unordered point clouds, largely ignoring their practical values in typical
point cloud processing applications, in which extra-large volume of data,
diverse scene contents, varying point density, data modality need to be
considered. In this paper, we provide a meta review on deep learning approaches
and datasets that cover a selection of critical tasks of point cloud processing
in use such as scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and
modeling. By reviewing a broad range of urban and environmental applications
these tasks can support, we identify gaps to be closed as these methods
transformed into applications and draw concluding remarks in both the
algorithmic and practical aspects of the surveyed methods.

TL;DR: A Two-Stage Decoupling Framework (TSDF) for glaucoma prognosis that handles variable-length sequential data and addresses limited dataset sizes through self-supervised learning and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, requiring timely prognosis. Existing methods are constrained by fixed-length inputs and struggle with limited glaucoma dataset sizes using end-to-end models.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Feature representation module using self-supervised learning to aggregate multiple datasets, 2) Temporal aggregation module with attention mechanism for variable-length sequential inputs.

Result: Extensive experiments on OHTS and GRAPE datasets show the approach is effective and robust across different scales and clinical settings, enhancing performance while maintaining compact parameter size.

Conclusion: TSDF successfully addresses limitations of traditional glaucoma prognosis methods by enabling flexible variable-length input processing and better feature learning from multiple datasets of varying sizes.

Abstract: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide.
Glaucoma prognosis is essential for identifying at-risk patients and enabling
timely intervention to prevent blindness. Many existing approaches rely on
historical sequential data but are constrained by fixed-length inputs, limiting
their flexibility. Additionally, traditional glaucoma prognosis methods often
employ end-to-end models, which struggle with the limited size of glaucoma
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Stage Decoupling
Framework (TSDF) for variable-length glaucoma prognosis. In the first stage, we
employ a feature representation module that leverages self-supervised learning
to aggregate multiple glaucoma datasets for training, disregarding differences
in their supervisory information. This approach enables datasets of varying
sizes to learn better feature representations. In the second stage, we
introduce a temporal aggregation module that incorporates an attention-based
mechanism to process sequential inputs of varying lengths, ensuring flexible
and efficient utilization of all available data. This design significantly
enhances model performance while maintaining a compact parameter size.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark glaucoma datasets:the Ocular
Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) and the Glaucoma Real-world Appraisal
Progression Ensemble (GRAPE),which differ significantly in scale and clinical
settings,demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

TL;DR: A novel tokenizer training scheme with main-training and post-training phases that addresses the discrepancy between reconstruction and generation distributions in image generative models, improving latent space construction and decoding robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image tokenizers prioritize reconstruction tasks but fail to consider generation errors during sampling, creating a significant discrepancy between reconstruction and generation distributions that affects generative model performance.

Method: Proposes a two-phase training scheme: 1) Main training with latent perturbation strategy to simulate sampling noises and unexpected tokens, 2) Post-training that optimizes the tokenizer decoder with a well-trained generative model to mitigate distribution differences. Also introduces pFID evaluation metric.

Result: Achieves 1.60 gFID with main training alone and further improves to 1.36 gFID with additional post-training using a ~400M generator. The method is validated across discrete/continuous tokenizers and autoregressive/diffusion generators.

Conclusion: The proposed training scheme significantly enhances tokenizer robustness, boosts generation quality and convergence speed, and successfully bridges the gap between reconstruction and generation distributions in image generative models.

Abstract: Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a
pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However,
there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and
generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the
reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering
the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively
analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from
which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both
main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space
construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent
perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the
unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the
robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence
speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully
correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During
post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a
well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between
generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete
tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID
and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further
experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our
post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers,
coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRT is a foundational model for 4D single-chip mmWave radar that achieves high-quality 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation using raw radar data, demonstrating strong generalization and data scaling properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: mmWave radars have poor angular resolution despite being robust and inexpensive. Existing learning methods lack standardized foundational models and large datasets, requiring practitioners to train task-specific models from small datasets.

Method: Collected 1M samples (29 hours) of raw radar data and trained a Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT) that processes raw radar inputs to predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation.

Result: GRT achieves quality typically only possible with higher resolution sensors, generalizes across diverse settings, shows 20% performance improvement per 10x data increase, and raw data outperforms lossy representations equivalent to 10x more training data.

Conclusion: Raw radar data is crucial for performance, GRT demonstrates strong foundational capabilities, and approximately 100M samples (3000 hours) would be needed to fully exploit GRT's potential.

Abstract: mmWave radars are compact, inexpensive, and durable sensors that are robust
to occlusions and work regardless of environmental conditions, such as weather
and darkness. However, this comes at the cost of poor angular resolution,
especially for inexpensive single-chip radars, which are typically used in
automotive and indoor sensing applications. Although many have proposed
learning-based methods to mitigate this weakness, no standardized foundational
models or large datasets for the mmWave radar have emerged, and practitioners
have largely trained task-specific models from scratch using relatively small
datasets.
  In this paper, we collect (to our knowledge) the largest available raw radar
dataset with 1M samples (29 hours) and train a foundational model for 4D
single-chip radar, which can predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation
with quality that is typically only possible with much higher resolution
sensors. We demonstrate that our Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT)
generalizes across diverse settings, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and
shows logarithmic data scaling of 20\% per $10\times$ data. We also run
extensive ablations on common design decisions, and find that using raw radar
data significantly outperforms widely-used lossy representations, equivalent to
a $10\times$ increase in training data. Finally, we roughly estimate that
$\approx$100M samples (3000 hours) of data are required to fully exploit the
potential of GRT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLMs excel in multimodal tasks, their robustness under noisy conditions remains poorly understood, necessitating systematic evaluation of performance degradation under controlled perturbations.

Method: Developed evaluation framework using both lexical metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based similarity measures with sentence embeddings to assess semantic alignment across diverse datasets under controlled noise conditions.

Result: Key findings: (1) Ground-truth caption quality significantly impacts performance; (2) Larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but don't universally outperform smaller models; (3) JPEG compression and motion blur cause dramatic performance degradation across all models.

Conclusion: The study reveals nuanced trade-offs between model size, dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, providing a standardized benchmark for future robust multimodal learning research.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across
multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this
study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the
performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations,
including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used
both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based
similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment.
Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1)
descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model
performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but
do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such
as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across
models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size,
dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized
benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IG-CAM is a novel weakly supervised semantic segmentation method that uses instance guidance and influence functions to generate high-quality boundary-aware localization maps, achieving state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods struggle with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on discriminative regions rather than complete object coverage.

Method: Proposes IG-CAM with three key innovations: Instance-Guided Refinement using ground truth masks, Influence Function Integration for robust features, and Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement for precise boundaries.

Result: Achieves 82.3% mIoU before post-processing and 86.6% after CRF refinement on PASCAL VOC 2012, significantly outperforming previous methods with superior boundary accuracy and complete object coverage.

Conclusion: IG-CAM establishes a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic segmentation, offering a practical solution when pixel-level annotations are unavailable or too expensive.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) addresses the challenge of
training segmentation models using only image-level annotations, eliminating
the need for expensive pixel-level labeling. While existing methods struggle
with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most
discriminative regions, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation
Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence
functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our
method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement that
uses ground truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete
object coverage rather than just discriminative parts; (2) Influence Function
Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model
predictions, leading to more robust feature representations; and (3)
Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement that employs progressive refinement strategies
to achieve sharp, precise object boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with an mIoU of 82.3% before
post-processing, which further improves to 86.6% after applying Conditional
Random Field (CRF) refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS
methods. Our approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, with
complete object coverage and precise boundary delineation, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution
of each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images
showcase the method's robustness and generalization capability. The results
establish IG-CAM as a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation, offering a practical solution for scenarios where pixel-level
annotations are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

Result: Preliminary results on ShapeNet dataset show promise in producing clean, complete meshes.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential for real-world applications with noisy sensor data like LiDAR and RGB-D cameras.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating artist-style meshes from
noisy or incomplete point clouds, such as those captured by real-world sensors
like LiDAR or mobile RGB-D cameras. Artist-created meshes are crucial for
commercial graphics pipelines due to their compatibility with animation and
texturing tools and their efficiency in rendering. However, existing approaches
often assume clean, complete inputs or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we
propose an end-to-end method that refines the input point cloud and directly
produces high-quality, artist-style meshes. At the core of our approach is a
novel reformulation of 3D point cloud refinement as a 2D inpainting task,
enabling the use of powerful generative models. Preliminary results on the
ShapeNet dataset demonstrate the promise of our framework in producing clean,
complete meshes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stalk diameter measurement methods are labor-intensive, error-prone, and not scalable for modern breeding programs that require high-throughput phenotyping of structural traits.

Method: Geometry-aware pipeline combining deep learning instance segmentation, 3D point cloud reconstruction, and PCA-based axis-aligned slicing to estimate stalk diameter while handling curvature, occlusion, and noise.

Result: The approach provides robust diameter estimation by mitigating common challenges in plant imaging, offering a scalable solution for phenotyping.

Conclusion: This computer vision method enables reliable, high-throughput stalk diameter measurement to support crop breeding and agronomic research programs.

Abstract: Accurate, high-throughput phenotyping is a critical component of modern crop
breeding programs, especially for improving traits such as mechanical
stability, biomass production, and disease resistance. Stalk diameter is a key
structural trait, but traditional measurement methods are labor-intensive,
error-prone, and unsuitable for scalable phenotyping. In this paper, we present
a geometry-aware computer vision pipeline for estimating stalk diameter from
RGB-D imagery. Our method integrates deep learning-based instance segmentation,
3D point cloud reconstruction, and axis-aligned slicing via Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects
of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and
reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and
agronomic research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a federated learning method for multi-label classification using Neural Collapse theory and feature disentanglement to handle skewed label distributions across clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning performance deteriorates with decentralized heterogeneous data, especially in multi-label scenarios with complex label relationships. Most FL research focuses on single-label classification, but real-world applications like medical imaging often involve multi-label settings with skewed label distributions.

Method: Uses Neural Collapse theory to align feature distributions across clients. Introduces feature disentanglement module to extract semantically specific features for multi-label settings. Uses predefined shared NC structure to guide clustering of disentangled features and regularization losses to encourage compact clustering in latent space.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings show the approach outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenging FL scenario of multi-label classification with skewed label distributions by leveraging Neural Collapse theory and feature disentanglement.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of
deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous
data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data
exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label
dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.
While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label
classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as
medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address
this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label
data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a
geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class
collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class
means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we
propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn
high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure
applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain
multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that
extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled
class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which
mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data
distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage
compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four
benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging
FL scenario.

Motivation: Address the ecological invalidity gap between offline benchmarks and real-world face forgery detection by capturing diverse human forgery intents and complex text-image interactions in social media contexts.

Method: Multi-agent framework with LLM-powered agents equipped with profile and memory modules that simulate forgery creation in social environments, using Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) to ensure data quality and diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant performance gains for detectors of multiple architectures, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in generating valuable training data.

Conclusion: The simulation-driven approach successfully bridges the gap between synthetic benchmarks and real-world detection efficacy by generating nuanced text-image consistency data beyond simple binary classification.

Abstract: Face forgery detection faces a critical challenge: a persistent gap between
offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy,which we attribute to the ecological
invalidity of training data.This work introduces Agent4FaceForgery to address
two fundamental problems: (1) how to capture the diverse intents and iterative
processes of human forgery creation, and (2) how to model the complex, often
adversarial, text-image interactions that accompany forgeries in social media.
To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents,
equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation
process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to
generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond
simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism
ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the
data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance
gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the
effectiveness and value of our framework.

TL;DR: MGNM uses Graph Neural Networks with multimodal features for better Human-Object Interaction detection, outperforming Transformer methods on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer architectures don't explicitly model relational structures in HOI detection, while GNNs are inherently better suited for capturing relationships between human-object pairs.

Method: Multimodal Graph Network Modeling (MGNM) with four-stage graph structure and multi-level feature interaction mechanism using both vision and language features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks, with significant gains when using advanced object detectors and balanced rare/non-rare class performance.

Conclusion: GNN-based relational modeling with multimodal features is more effective than Transformer approaches for HOI detection, providing better relationship recognition and balanced performance.

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for
Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture
does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection,
which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly
model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork
\textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to
enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network
framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure.
Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within
our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language
features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs.
Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a
more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant
performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare
classes.

*Kunliang Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VQT-Light is a novel lighting estimation framework using VQVAE and ViT that treats illumination estimation as a multiclass classification task, achieving 40FPS inference with improved texture fidelity and performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lighting estimation methods struggle with restoring detailed illumination textures while maintaining fast running speed and high fidelity, creating a need for a more effective solution.

Method: Combines VQVAE for discrete feature extraction to avoid posterior collapse and ViT for capturing global context and dependencies, formulating lighting estimation as a multiclass classification task.

Result: Achieves 40FPS inference speed, improves multiple evaluation metrics, and produces light maps with richer texture and better fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: VQT-Light demonstrates superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative experiments, providing a lightweight and fast solution for accurate lighting estimation with improved texture detail.

Abstract: Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in
computer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to
restore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in running
speed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes
two modules: feature extraction and lighting estimation. First, we take
advantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather
than continuous features to avoid "posterior collapse". Second, we capture
global context and dependencies of input image through ViT rather than CNNs to
improve the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the
above two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass
classification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our
model predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping
lightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and
improves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [29] [Adaptive Sampling Scheduler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12569)
*Qi Wang,Shuliang Zhu,Jinjia Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler for consistency distillation frameworks with dynamic timestep selection, optimized alternating sampling, and stabilization techniques to improve flexibility and generation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distillation methods rely on fixed timestep selection strategies that limit flexibility and require specialized schedulers for different distillation processes, restricting the full potential of diffusion models.

Method: Develops an adaptive sampling scheduler with three strategies: dynamic target timestep selection based on importance, optimized alternating sampling along solution trajectories, and smoothing clipping with color balancing for stable high-quality generation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show significant improvements in generative performance across various consistency distillation methods, demonstrating strong adaptability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The adaptive sampling scheduler successfully overcomes limitations of existing methods by providing flexible, framework-agnostic timestep selection that enhances diffusion model performance in practical applications.

Abstract: Consistent distillation methods have evolved into effective techniques that
significantly accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Although
existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target
timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic
strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically
for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits
flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion
models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various
consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative
strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different
consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their
computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution
trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on
the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the
solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of
smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and
high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the
applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation
scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive
sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through
comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently
demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting
the strong adaptability achieved by our method.

*Yizhen Lao,Yu Zhang,Ziting Wang,Chengbo Wang,Yifei Xue,Wanpeng Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisorientLiDAR: A novel adversarial attack framework that targets LiDAR-based localization by strategically removing critical keypoints through reverse-engineering, causing significant localization drift in autonomous vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but there has been little exploration of attacks on LiDAR-based localization for self-driving cars, which poses serious security challenges.

Method: Reverse-engineer localization models to identify critical keypoints, then strategically remove them. Evaluated on three point-cloud registration models using KITTI dataset and validated on Autoware platform. Extended to physical world using near-infrared absorptive materials.

Result: Removing Top-K keypoint regions significantly degrades registration accuracy. Hiding few critical regions causes noticeable localization drift. Physical-world attacks successfully replicated the effects observed in simulation.

Conclusion: The attack demonstrates veracity and generality, bringing realistic physical-world attacks closer to implementation and highlighting serious security vulnerabilities in LiDAR-based localization systems.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks
with visually imperceptible perturbations. Even this poses a serious security
challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little
exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied
to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework
called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By
reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks),
adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them,
thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on
three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and
GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their
registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware
autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces
noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical
world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials,
thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This
step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that
demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.

*Pengbo Guo,Chengxu Liu,Guoshuai Zhao,Xingsong Hou,Jialie Shen,Xueming Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel spectral learning approach for reflection removal using Spectral Codebook to reconstruct optical spectrum, enabling better reflection distinction through wavelength differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reflection removal methods work only in image domain and ignore spectral properties, limiting their ability to effectively distinguish reflections from transmission components.

Method: Proposes Spectral Codebook to reconstruct reflection image spectrum, uses spectral prior refinement modules for spatial redistribution and spectral enhancement, and Spectrum-Aware Transformer for joint recovery in spectral and pixel domains.

Result: Superior performance and generalization ability demonstrated on three different reflection benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Spectral learning perspective with spectral codebook and transformer architecture effectively addresses reflection removal by leveraging wavelength differences in optical spectrum.

Abstract: Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective
medium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary
challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components
in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing
and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address
reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property
variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively
discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral
learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum
of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by
perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the
spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior
refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and
adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension.
Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the
transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on
three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and
generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.

*Liming Lu,Shuchao Pang,Xu Zheng,Xiang Gu,Anan Du,Yunhuai Liu,Yongbin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIARD is a novel adversarial robustness distillation method that uses a multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment and continuous adversarial retraining to improve both clean accuracy and adversarial robustness in student models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ARD methods suffer from degraded performance on clean examples due to divergent optimization objectives between clean and robust teachers, and performance deterioration of robust teachers from iteratively generated adversarial examples during training.

Method: Proposes Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) with: 1) multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment to resolve optimization conflicts, and 2) continuous adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against varying adversarial examples.

Result: Achieves average 3.53% improvement in adversarial defense rates across various attack scenarios and 5.87% increase in clean sample accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets.

Conclusion: CIARD establishes a new benchmark for balancing model robustness and generalization, demonstrating significant improvements in both adversarial defense and clean accuracy performance.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance
and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling
resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD
approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads
to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this
problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The
divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and
robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and
2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to
performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key
innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment
to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous
adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against
performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD
achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial
defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean
sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness
and generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/eminentgu/CIARD

### [34] [Beyond Artificial Misalignment: Detecting and Grounding Semantic-Coordinated Multimodal Manipulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12653)
*Jinjie Shen,Yaxiong Wang,Lechao Cheng,Nan Pu,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new approach for detecting multimodal manipulations where visual edits are paired with semantically consistent text, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks that create artificial misalignments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing manipulation detection benchmarks suffer from misalignment artifacts that don't reflect real-world manipulation patterns, where practical attacks maintain semantic consistency across modalities.

Method: Created the SAMM dataset through a two-stage pipeline (image manipulations + contextually-plausible text generation) and proposed RamDG framework that uses retrieval-augmented detection with external knowledge repositories.

Result: The framework significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 2.06% higher detection accuracy on the SAMM dataset compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed semantically-aligned manipulation detection approach effectively addresses real-world manipulation patterns and demonstrates superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: The detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data has
emerged as a critical challenge in media forensics. While existing benchmarks
demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that
poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically
maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets
artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable
anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of
semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically
paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins
with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM)
dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art
image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible
textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this
foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and
Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge
repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary
texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding
and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to
state-of-the-art approaches. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://github.com/shen8424/SAMM-RamDG-CAP.

*YiTong Liu,TianZhu Liu,YanFeng GU*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion (MFAF) method for cross-view geo-localization that captures multi-frequency features and uses spatial attention to handle viewpoint variations and background noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-view geo-localization approaches neglect spatial and semantic information while extracting features through feature map segmentation, failing to handle significant appearance variations across different viewpoints.

Method: Proposes MFAF method with Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block (MFB) to capture low-frequency structural and high-frequency edge details across multiple scales, and Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module to adaptively focus on key regions of frequency features.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV benchmarks for both drone localization and drone navigation tasks.

Conclusion: The MFAF method effectively addresses viewpoint variability and background noise issues in cross-view geo-localization through multi-scale frequency feature extraction and attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims to determine the geographical location of a
query image by matching it against a gallery of images. This task is
challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed
from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative
features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature
map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address
these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion
(MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block
(MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block
effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency
edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness
of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module
adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly
mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint
variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including
University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method
achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone
navigation tasks.

### [36] [A Comparative Study of YOLOv8 to YOLOv11 Performance in Underwater Vision Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12682)
*Gordon Hung,Ivan Felipe Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides the first controlled comparison of YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s on underwater imagery, showing that accuracy saturates after YOLOv9 while inference speed improves, with YOLOv10-s offering the best speed-accuracy trade-off for AUV deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater computer vision for AUVs faces challenges including light attenuation, turbidity, class imbalance, and limited computational resources. While YOLO detectors are attractive for their low latency, their performance in marine environments remains unclear as terrestrial benchmarks don't reflect underwater conditions.

Method: The authors curated two underwater datasets (Coral Disease: 4,480 images/18 classes; Fish Species: 7,500 images/20 classes) with four training regimes (25%, 50%, 75%, 100% of images). They trained YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical hyperparameters and evaluated precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, inference time, and FPS, supplemented with Grad-CAM visualizations.

Result: Accuracy saturates after YOLOv9 across both datasets, indicating architectural innovations primarily target efficiency rather than accuracy. However, inference speed improves markedly. YOLOv10-s offers the best speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment.

Conclusion: The study provides the first comprehensive benchmark of recent YOLO variants on underwater imagery, demonstrates YOLOv10-s as optimal for AUV applications, and delivers an open, reproducible codebase to accelerate future marine-vision research.

Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board
computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological
monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is
hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the
computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from
the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and
classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial
benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how
successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly
available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease
set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20
classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %,
100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions
fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical
hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate
precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and
frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature
utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy
saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target
efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly.
Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants
on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best
speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an
open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision
research.

Abstract: Stereo matching plays a crucial role in enabling depth perception for

trained on 11 existing stereo datasets in terms of generalization accuracy
across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into multi-dataset
training, StereoCarla contributes substantial improvements to generalization
accuracy, highlighting its compatibility and scalability. This dataset provides
a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating stereo algorithms under

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes) produce smoke that reduces visibility in surveillance systems, impairing emergency response. Current smoke removal algorithms are limited due to lack of large-scale real-world datasets with paired clean and smoke-degraded images.

Method: Created a real-world surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset (SmokeBench) containing precisely aligned image pairs captured under diverse scenes and smoke concentrations, enabling supervised learning and rigorous evaluation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments benchmarking various desmoking methods on the dataset demonstrate its value for advancing robust image desmoking in real-world fire scenes.

Conclusion: SmokeBench provides a valuable foundation for practical image desmoking research and has been publicly released to facilitate advancements in emergency response visibility enhancement.

Abstract: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes after ignition) represent a crucial
temporal window for emergency interventions. During this stage, the smoke
produced by combustion significantly reduces the visibility of surveillance
systems, severely impairing situational awareness and hindering effective
emergency response and rescue operations. Consequently, there is an urgent need
to remove smoke from images to obtain clear scene information. However, the
development of smoke removal algorithms remains limited due to the lack of
large-scale, real-world datasets comprising paired smoke-free and
smoke-degraded images. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset named SmokeBench, which contains
image pairs captured under diverse scenes setup and smoke concentration. The
curated dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling
supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of desmoking methods on our dataset. Our
dataset provides a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical image
desmoking in real-world fire scenes. This dataset has been released to the

Motivation: Existing text-driven infrared and visible image fusion methods lack goal-aligned tasks to supervise and evaluate how effectively input text contributes to fusion outcomes. The authors observed that referring image segmentation and text-driven fusion share the common objective of highlighting text-referred objects.

Method: Proposed RIS-FUSION framework with LangGatedFusion module that injects textual features into the fusion backbone for semantic alignment. Created MM-RIS benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets (infrared-visible image pairs + segmentation masks + referring expressions).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in mIoU (mean Intersection over Union).

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully bridges text-driven image fusion and referring image segmentation, demonstrating that joint optimization of both tasks leads to significantly improved performance in highlighting text-referred objects in fused images.

Abstract: Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for
enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing
methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the
input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image
segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective:
highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose
RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint
optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual
features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support
multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a
large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each
consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a
referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in

Motivation: Address challenges in CZSL including entangled attributes/objects and long-tailed distributions in real-world data, inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and perception share similar neural processes.

Method: Integrates disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature augmentation with debiasing strategy, explicitly leveraging prior knowledge of seen attributes/objects to synthesize high-fidelity composition features.

Result: Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world settings.

Conclusion: DeFA effectively addresses CZSL challenges through debiased feature augmentation, showing strong compositional generalization capabilities across different evaluation settings.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen
attribute-object compositions by learning prior knowledge of seen primitives,
\textit{i.e.}, attributes and objects. Learning generalizable compositional
representations in CZSL remains challenging due to the entangled nature of
attributes and objects as well as the prevalence of long-tailed distributions
in real-world data. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and
perception share similar neural processes, we propose a novel approach called
Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) to address these challenges. The proposed
DeFA integrates a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature
augmentation with a debiasing strategy. DeFA explicitly leverages the prior
knowledge of seen attributes and objects by synthesizing high-fidelity
composition features to support compositional generalization. Extensive
experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DeFA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both \textit{closed-world} and
\textit{open-world} settings.

*Heng Zhang,Haichuan Hu,Yaomin Shen,Weihao Yu,Yilei Yuan,Haochen You,Guo Cheng,Zijian Zhang,Lubin Gan,Huihui Wei,Hao Zhang,Jin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AsyMoE addresses asymmetry in vision-language MoE models by introducing three specialized expert groups for better modality-specific processing and cross-modal interactions, achieving significant performance improvements with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MoE approaches struggle with the fundamental asymmetry between visual (spatial completeness) and linguistic (sequential context) processing, causing language experts to lose contextual grounding and rely excessively on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing multimodal information.

Method: Proposes AsyMoE architecture with three expert groups: intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain contextual grounding.

Result: Achieves 26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

Conclusion: AsyMoE effectively addresses the modality asymmetry problem in vision-language models through specialized expert design, demonstrating superior performance and parameter efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training.
However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to
the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is
spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As
a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and
cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language
experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more
on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and
linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel
architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.
We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic
inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and
evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain
contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves
26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific
MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

*Pukun Zhao,Longxiang Wang,Miaowei Wang,Chen Chen,Fanqing Zhou,Haojian Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two dynamic spatial reasoning benchmarks that test models' abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning under partial observability and dynamic environmental changes, revealing limitations in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or fully observable environments, failing to capture challenges of long-horizon reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic changes.

Method: Two dynamic spatial benchmarks: locally observable maze navigation and match-2 elimination, each requiring continuous cognitive updates as actions trigger structural environment changes. A subjective experience-based memory mechanism is proposed for cross-task experience transfer.

Result: Experiments show the benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic spatial reasoning and long-term memory capabilities.

Conclusion: The benchmarks provide a comprehensive platform for evaluating and advancing methods in dynamic spatial reasoning, addressing gaps in current evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally
observable environments, failing to capture the challenges of long-horizon
reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic
changes. We introduce two dynamic spatial benchmarks, locally observable maze
navigation and match-2 elimination that systematically evaluate models'
abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning when local perception,
environment feedback, and global objectives are tightly coupled. Each action
triggers structural changes in the environment, requiring continuous update of
cognition and strategy. We further propose a subjective experience-based memory
mechanism for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments show
that our benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic
spatial reasoning and long-term memory, providing a comprehensive platform for
future methodological advances. Our code and data are available at

### [43] [SPGen: Spherical Projection as Consistent and Flexible Representation for Single Image 3D Shape Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12721)
*Jingdong Zhang,Weikai Chen,Yuan Liu,Jionghao Wang,Zhengming Yu,Zhuowen Shen,Bo Yang,Wenping Wang,Xin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPGen introduces a novel 3D generation method using spherical projection to encode geometry onto 2D maps, eliminating view inconsistencies while handling complex internal structures efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-view 3D generative models suffer from inter-view inconsistencies and cannot faithfully represent complex internal structures or nontrivial topologies.

Method: Encodes geometry information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a compact multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation, operating solely in the image domain.

Result: SPGen significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and computational efficiency, offering consistency, flexibility for nested structures, and efficient finetuning.

Conclusion: The spherical projection approach provides a superior solution for 3D generation by leveraging 2D diffusion priors while maintaining geometric consistency and handling complex topologies.

Abstract: Existing single-view 3D generative models typically adopt multiview diffusion
priors to reconstruct object surfaces, yet they remain prone to inter-view
inconsistencies and are unable to faithfully represent complex internal
structure or nontrivial topologies. In particular, we encode geometry
information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a
compact and structural multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation.
Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen offers three key advantages
simultaneously: (1) Consistency. The injective SP mapping encodes surface
geometry with a single viewpoint which naturally eliminates view inconsistency
and ambiguity; (2) Flexibility. Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal
structures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3)
Efficiency. The image-domain formulation allows the direct inheritance of
powerful 2D diffusion priors and enables efficient finetuning with limited
computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPGen
significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and
computational efficiency.

### [44] [Defense-to-Attack: Bypassing Weak Defenses Enables Stronger Jailbreaks in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12724)
*Yunhan Zhao,Xiang Zheng,Xingjun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Defense2Attack is a novel jailbreak method that uses defensive patterns to enhance attack effectiveness on Vision-Language Models, achieving superior performance in single attempts compared to multi-try state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, and existing methods lack both effectiveness and efficiency. The paper reveals that incorporating weak defense into attacks can significantly improve jailbreak performance.

Method: Defense2Attack uses three components: (1) visual optimizer with adversarial perturbations and encouraging semantics, (2) textual optimizer with defense-styled prompts, and (3) red-team suffix generator with reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: The method was evaluated on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks, demonstrating superior jailbreak performance in single attempts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods that require multiple tries.

Conclusion: The work provides a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs by showing that leveraging defensive patterns can significantly enhance both effectiveness and efficiency of attacks.

Abstract: Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have
achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be
improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak
defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the
effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this
insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the
safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak
prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:
(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with
affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the
input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that
enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically
evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results
demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a
single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often
require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

TL;DR: WaveVerse is a prompt-based framework that simulates realistic RF signals from generated indoor scenes with human motions, enabling data generation for RF imaging and improving performance in RF sensing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic indoor environments is challenging, and there's a need for privacy-preserving alternatives to vision-based sensing methods.

Method: Uses language-guided 4D world generator with state-aware causal transformer for human motion generation, and phase-coherent ray tracing simulator for accurate RF signal simulation.

Result: Effective conditioned human motion generation, enables RF imaging data generation for the first time, and achieves performance gains in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

Conclusion: WaveVerse provides a scalable framework for realistic RF signal simulation that advances RF sensing capabilities while preserving privacy.

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as a powerful, privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based methods for indoor perception tasks. However,
collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic and diverse indoor environments
remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce WaveVerse, a
prompt-based, scalable framework that simulates realistic RF signals from
generated indoor scenes with human motions. WaveVerse introduces a
language-guided 4D world generator, which includes a state-aware causal
transformer for human motion generation conditioned on spatial constraints and
texts, and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator that enables the simulation
of accurate and coherent RF signals. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase
coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further
present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity
recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for
RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain
in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

### [46] [Effective Gaussian Management for High-fidelity Object Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12742)
*Jiateng Liu,Hao Gao,Jiu-Cheng Xie,Chi-Man Pun,Jian Xiong,Haolun Li,Feng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Gaussian management approach for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction that dynamically activates spherical harmonics or normals, adapts SH orders based on gradients, and performs task-decoupled pruning to achieve superior quality with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Gaussian Splatting methods use indiscriminate attribute assignment which causes gradient conflicts from dual supervision and inefficient representation. The paper aims to address these issues for better reconstruction quality and efficiency.

Method: Introduces a densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical harmonics or normals under surface reconstruction supervision. Develops a lightweight Gaussian representation that adaptively adjusts SH orders based on gradient magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove unnecessary Gaussians.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and efficiency, achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed Gaussian management approach effectively mitigates gradient conflicts, improves representation efficiency, and is model-agnostic - seamlessly integrating into other frameworks to enhance performance while reducing model size.

Abstract: This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for
high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting
(GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach
introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical
harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction
module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual
supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve
representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation
that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient
magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal
impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the
representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management
approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other
frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency,
achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

### [47] [Modelling and analysis of the 8 filters from the "master key filters hypothesis" for depthwise-separable deep networks in relation to idealized receptive fields based on scale-space theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12746)
*Tony Lindeberg,Zahra Babaiee,Peyman M. Kiasari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of 8 master key filters from ConvNeXt depthwise-separable networks shows learned filters can be modeled as separable Gaussian-based difference operators with good predictive performance when replacing learned filters with idealized versions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and model the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks, specifically analyzing whether they can be approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

Method: Applied clustering to extract 8 master key filters, computed spatial spread measures, modeled filters as difference operators applied to discrete Gaussian kernels, and performed model fitting using spatial variance matching and norm minimization.

Result: The learned filters show good qualitative similarity to idealized models, with non-centered filters having spatial offsets close to half a grid unit. Idealized models demonstrate good predictive properties when replacing learned filters.

Conclusion: Learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well approximated by discrete scale-space filters, supporting the hypothesis that they operate as separable filtering operations.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8
``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering
approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks
based on the ConvNeXt architecture.
  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of
weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the
learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned
filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial
domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are
non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered
``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial
smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel,
and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields
show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.
  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly
different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each
filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate
directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring
spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of
the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or
$l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned
filters.
  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of
receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned
filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing
that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well
approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

*Rishab Parthasarathy,Jasmine Collins,Cory Stephenson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how multimodal LLMs evaluate image quality compared to humans, finding significant differences in how they perceive and judge various image attributes like aesthetics, artifacts, anatomical accuracy, composition, object adherence, and style.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated evaluation of text-to-image models is challenging, and while recent works use multimodal LLMs for image quality assessment, there's limited understanding of how these models use human-relevant concepts like style and composition in their judgments.

Method: The researchers curated a dataset of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs, analyzed inter-task correlations between image quality attributes for both humans and LLMs, and created synthetic datasets with controlled variations for each quality attribute to study individual attribute perception.

Result: Humans show strong relationships between image quality attributes in their judgments, while LLMs show much weaker correlations. Humans can easily judge all specific image quality attributes, but LLMs struggle with certain attributes like anatomical accuracy.

Conclusion: There are significant differences between how humans and multimodal LLMs perceive images, revealing that LLMs don't process image quality attributes in the same interconnected way as humans do, particularly struggling with anatomical accuracy judgments.

Abstract: Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging
problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality
of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make
use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to
generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an
image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy,
compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both
LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset
of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use
inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to
understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating
the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image
quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality
attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for
each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect
to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic
image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are
much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together,
these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal
LLMs perceive images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCOT is a recurrent transformer framework for cross-view object geo-localization that uses iterative refinement with SAM knowledge distillation and hierarchical attention to achieve state-of-the-art performance with 60% fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVOGL approaches treat the task as one-shot detection, making them vulnerable to feature noise and lacking error correction mechanisms, which limits their accuracy and robustness.

Method: Proposes ReCOT with learnable tokens that iteratively attend to reference features, SAM-based knowledge distillation for semantic guidance, and Reference Feature Enhancement Module with hierarchical attention to focus on object-relevant regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard CVOGL benchmarks while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA approaches.

Conclusion: Reformulating CVOGL as a recurrent localization task with iterative refinement and enhanced feature attention significantly improves accuracy and efficiency in cross-view object geo-localization.

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to determine the location of
a specific object in high-resolution satellite imagery given a query image with
a point prompt. Existing approaches treat CVOGL as a one-shot detection task,
directly regressing object locations from cross-view information aggregation,
but they are vulnerable to feature noise and lack mechanisms for error
correction. In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object
geo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent
localization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode
task-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and
iteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location.
To enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules:
(1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation
priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic
guidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature
Enhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize
object-relevant regions in the reference features. Extensive experiments on
standard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A-TDOM is a near real-time True Digital Orthophoto Map generation method using On-the-Fly 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization that processes images sequentially as they're acquired, enabling active TDOM rendering with seconds-per-image optimization while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TDOM generation relies on complex offline photogrammetric pipelines causing delays that prevent real-time applications, and quality degrades due to inaccurate camera poses, DSM errors, and scene occlusions.

Method: Uses On-the-Fly SfM to compute pose and sparse point cloud for each new image, integrates new Gaussians into previously unseen regions, optimizes 3DGS field, and employs orthogonal splatting to render TDOM after each update.

Result: Initial experiments show A-TDOM can actively render TDOM in near real-time with 3DGS optimization for each new image completed in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality and geometric accuracy.

Conclusion: A-TDOM successfully addresses the limitations of traditional TDOM generation by enabling near real-time processing with sequential image integration and optimization, making it suitable for real-time geospatial applications.

Abstract: True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in
various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc.
However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex
offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time
applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various
challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and
scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a
near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As
each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via
On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously
unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal
splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field.
Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is
capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization
for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality
and TDOM geometric accuracy.

multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context
collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module
(DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on
learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce
computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that
DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary
accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower

*Mohammed Al-Habib,Zuping Zhang,Abdulrahman Noman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BATR-FST is a two-stage Vision Transformer approach for few-shot learning that uses bi-level token refinement with clustering, uncertainty weighting, and attention mechanisms to improve performance on limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers struggle with few-shot learning due to poor token-level interactions, limited training data challenges, and weak inductive bias. Existing methods rely on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures that fail to incorporate global context and localized feature refinement effectively.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Pre-training with Masked Image Modeling for transferable patch-level representations 2) Meta-fine-tuning with Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module featuring Token Clustering, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting, Bi-Level Attention mechanism, Graph Token Propagation for semantic consistency, and Class Separation Penalty for discriminative capability.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets show BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, demonstrating improved few-shot classification performance via transformers.

Conclusion: BATR-FST effectively addresses Vision Transformers' limitations in few-shot learning by providing progressive token representation improvement and maintaining robust inductive bias through its bi-level adaptive refinement approach.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision
applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by
challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited
training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often
depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit
the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement.
To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for
Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively
improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for
few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling
(MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level
representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis
for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates
a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to
capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize
dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance
intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough
token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic
consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation
Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that
BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and
improves the few-shot classification via transformers.

*Zhifang Gong,Shuo Gao,Ben Zhao,Yingjing Xu,Yijun Yang,Shenghong Ju,Guangquan Zhou*

TL;DR: Novel Mamba-based framework for automatic pancreatic tumor subtyping using multi-phase CECT scans, achieving 97.4% accuracy in distinguishing PDAC from PNETs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to effectively utilize contextual information across multiple CECT phases used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, limiting performance for pancreatic tumor subtyping due to high heterogeneity and variability.

Method: Dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware Mamba module with spatial and temporal sampling sequences to explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations. Includes similarity-guided refinement for temporal modeling, space complementary integrator, and multi-granularity fusion for cross-scale semantics.

Result: Achieved 97.4% accuracy and 98.6% AUC on in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases for distinguishing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs).

Conclusion: The proposed Mamba-based framework demonstrates potential as a more accurate and efficient tool for pancreatic tumor subtyping by effectively modeling both temporal and spatial information from multi-phase CECT data.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique
that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the
accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the
high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial
challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to
effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases
commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their
performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way
to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor
subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and
simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase
CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware
Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to
explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A
similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning
modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious
temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and
multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across
different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic
tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases
achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
(PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.

*Zhehao Li,Yucheng Qian,Chong Wang,Yinghao Lu,Zhihao Yang,Jiafei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Contextualized Representation Learning Network for HOI detection that integrates affordance-guided reasoning and contextual prompts to better capture complex interactions involving tools and auxiliary objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing two-stage HOI detection approaches face challenges with incomplete context modeling, particularly for complex interactions involving tools and auxiliary entities.

Method: Expands HOI detection to include multivariate relationships through triplet structures <human, tool, object>, explicitly modeling functional affordances. Uses learnable prompts enriched with instance categories integrated with visual features via attention mechanism for language-image alignment.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on both HICO-Det and V-COCO datasets in most scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed contextualized representation learning with affordance-guided reasoning and prompt integration effectively captures complex, context-dependent human-object interactions.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to simultaneously localize
human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. While recent two-stage
approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to
incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized
Representation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided
reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex
interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding
it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships
involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the
functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet
structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify
tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable
prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with
contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns
language with image content at both global and regional levels. These
contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues
for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and
V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

### [55] [Double Helix Diffusion for Cross-Domain Anomaly Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12787)
*Linchun Wu,Qin Zou,Xianbiao Qi,Bo Du,Zhongyuan Wang,Qingquan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DH-Diff is a novel cross-domain generative framework that simultaneously synthesizes high-fidelity anomaly images and pixel-level masks, addressing structural inconsistency and feature entanglement issues in synthetic anomaly generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual anomaly inspection is hampered by scarcity of real anomaly samples for training. Current synthetic data generation methods suffer from structurally inconsistent anomalies and feature entanglement between images and annotation masks.

Method: Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff) uses a double helix-inspired architecture with domain-decoupled attention mechanism to mitigate feature entanglement and semantic score map alignment module to ensure structural authenticity. It offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments show DH-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

Conclusion: DH-Diff effectively addresses the limitations of current synthetic anomaly generation methods and provides a robust solution for generating realistic anomaly data to improve anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the
scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data
generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current
methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of
anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2)
the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and
their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism
of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel
cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize
high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly
addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by
a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation,
connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism
mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features
independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures
structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff
offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant
improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

*Julien Walther,Rémi Giraud,Michaël Clément*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPAM is a deep learning framework that generates accurate and regular superpixels by combining image features with semantic-agnostic segmentation from large pretrained models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional superpixel methods use low-level features while deep learning approaches sacrifice regularity for accuracy. There's a need for superpixels that are both accurate and regular for better interpretability.

Method: Train a model to extract image features for superpixel generation, then leverage large-scale pretrained models for semantic-agnostic segmentation to ensure superpixels align with object masks. Can handle prior segmentation and interactive object focusing.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods on segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: SPAM provides a versatile, robust framework for generating accurate yet regular superpixels, making it valuable for various computer vision applications.

Abstract: Superpixels are widely used in computer vision to simplify image
representation and reduce computational complexity. While traditional methods
rely on low-level features, deep learning-based approaches leverage high-level
features but also tend to sacrifice regularity of superpixels to capture
complex objects, leading to accurate but less interpretable segmentations. In
this work, we introduce SPAM (SuperPixel Anything Model), a versatile framework
for segmenting images into accurate yet regular superpixels. We train a model
to extract image features for superpixel generation, and at inference, we
leverage a large-scale pretrained model for semantic-agnostic segmentation to
ensure that superpixels align with object masks. SPAM can handle any prior
high-level segmentation, resolving uncertainty regions, and is able to
interactively focus on specific objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on segmentation tasks, making it a valuable and robust tool for various
applications. Code and pre-trained models are available here:

### [58] [SAGA: Selective Adaptive Gating for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12817)
*Yuan Cao,Dong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGA introduces selective adaptive gating to improve linear attention by addressing feature redundancy and low-rank constraints, achieving better computational efficiency and accuracy compared to standard linear attention methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer architectures face quadratic complexity bottlenecks with softmax attention in high-resolution vision tasks. Linear attention reduces complexity but suffers from uniform compression of KV information, leading to feature redundancy and performance gaps.

Method: Proposes SAGA with input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information aggregation into KV feature maps, enhancing semantic diversity while using efficient Hadamard-product decomposition for gate computation without additional memory overhead.

Result: Achieves 1.76× throughput improvement and 2.69× reduction in peak GPU memory at 1280×1280 resolution compared to PVT-T. Improves top-1 accuracy by up to 4.4% on ImageNet.

Conclusion: SAGA effectively bridges the performance gap between linear and softmax attention while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for high-resolution vision tasks.

Abstract: While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies
contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic
complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck,
particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents
a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$
to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most
existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly,
which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with
the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps,
contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate
this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive
\textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which
introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information
aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity
and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear
attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition
method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead.
Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in
throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at
a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up
to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency
and model effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic study of continual pretraining for medical vision encoders (MedImageInsight and RAD-DINO) on 3.5M chest x-rays shows task-specific scaling patterns and that as few as 30k in-domain samples can outperform open-weights foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging foundation models are limited by smaller datasets compared to general vision models like CLIP and DINOv2, and there's limited understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect performance in medical settings.

Method: Continual pretraining of two vision encoders (MI2 representing CLIP paradigm, RAD-DINO representing DINOv2 paradigm) on up to 3.5M chest x-rays from a single institution, with constant compute and evaluation protocols. Evaluated on classification, segmentation, and radiology report generation tasks.

Result: MI2 scales better for finding-related tasks, RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks. Continual pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured labels using UniCL improves performance. As few as 30k in-domain samples can surpass open-weights foundation models for some tasks.

Conclusion: Center-specific continual pretraining enables medical institutions to achieve significant performance gains using in-domain data, highlighting the utility of domain-specific adaptation even with limited samples.

Abstract: Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale
data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However,
medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets,
limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect
performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual
pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO
representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M
chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation
protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines
and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation.
While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings,
we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a
model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated
structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for
finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks.
Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured
labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured
supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k
in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models.
These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining,
enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by
utilizing in-domain data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combining DISTS and VMAF metrics improves correlation with subjective quality scores for NeRF-generated outputs across different datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF evaluation is challenging due to unique artifacts, and no single metric performs well across all datasets. Combining different perceptual metrics could overcome individual limitations.

Method: Two normalization strategies for individual metrics (DISTS and VMAF) and two fusion strategies were tested on Synthetic and Outdoor datasets across three configurations.

Result: The fusion metrics demonstrated improved correlation with subjective scores compared to individual metrics, showing robustness and generalizability.

Conclusion: Combining DISTS and VMAF through appropriate fusion strategies provides better evaluation of NeRF-generated outputs than using individual metrics alone.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in
synthesizing novel viewpoints. Evaluating the NeRF-generated outputs, however,
remains a challenge due to the unique artifacts they exhibit, and no individual
metric performs well across all datasets. We hypothesize that combining two
successful metrics, Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) and
Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), based on different perceptual
methods, can overcome the limitations of individual metrics and achieve
improved correlation with subjective quality scores. We experiment with two
normalization strategies for the individual metrics and two fusion strategies
to evaluate their impact on the resulting correlation with the subjective
scores. The proposed pipeline is tested on two distinct datasets, Synthetic and
Outdoor, and its performance is evaluated across three different
configurations. We present a detailed analysis comparing the correlation
coefficients of fusion methods and individual scores with subjective scores to
demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the fusion metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLMs can generate synthetic visual training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses by mapping visual abnormalities to text, achieving 88% F1 score on real data despite using only synthetic training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data collection is challenging for rare medical conditions and costly tasks. The paper addresses data scarcity in canine musculoskeletal diagnosis by leveraging LLMs' text generation capabilities to create synthetic visual training data.

Method: Developed a mapping system that segments visual documentations into 200+ labeled regions representing muscles/joints. Used guided decoding, chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting with LLMs to generate 1,000 synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation and other diagnoses.

Result: Generated synthetic data was sensitive to location and severity while independent of dog's sex. A model trained solely on synthetic data achieved 88% F1 score on 70 real-world documentations for binary classification.

Conclusion: LLM-generated synthetic data shows strong potential for addressing data scarcity, particularly in rare medical conditions. The methodology, while tailored to medical domain, can be adapted to other fields facing similar data limitations.

Abstract: It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model
performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due
to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our
use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting
the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as
colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to
distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which
large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications,
offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual
training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a
mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions
representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000
synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation)
diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our
analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and
severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We
further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to
create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this
synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations.
These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which
is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While
our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques
can be adapted to other fields.

*Avinaash Manoharan,Xiangyu Yin,Domenik Helm,Chih-Hong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCS is a label-free metric for evaluating object detectors using test-time data augmentation and spatial consistency of predictions across augmented views as a proxy for reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground-truth annotations are rarely available in real-world deployment, making it challenging to continuously monitor and compare object detection models.

Method: Applies test-time data augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented views, computes overlaps using IoU, normalizes maximum overlaps, and averages across augmentation pairs to measure spatial consistency.

Result: Achieved over 90% congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal Correction Cost in controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI datasets.

Conclusion: CCS provides a robust, model-agnostic foundation for DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors without requiring ground-truth annotations.

Abstract: Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because
ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative
Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring
and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data
augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented
views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps
are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of
spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations.
In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90%
congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal
Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and
two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight
under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for
DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.

TL;DR: PENet is a few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation framework that uses diffusion model features and dual prototypes to address intra-class diversity and inter-set inconsistency, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype-based methods struggle with intra-class diversity (limited prototype capacity) and inter-set inconsistency (misalignment between support and query feature spaces) in few-shot 3D segmentation.

Method: Prototype Expansion Network (PENet) with dual-stream architecture: Intrinsic Learner for representative features and Diffusion Learner using pre-trained diffusion encoder for generalizable features. Includes Prototype Assimilation Module with push-pull cross-guidance attention and Prototype Calibration Mechanism.

Result: Extensive experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet datasets show PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various few-shot settings.

Conclusion: PENet effectively addresses prototype limitations in few-shot 3D segmentation by leveraging diffusion model features and dual-stream learning, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to segment novel
categories using a minimal number of annotated support samples. While existing
prototype-based methods have shown promise, they are constrained by two
critical challenges: (1) Intra-class Diversity, where a prototype's limited
representational capacity fails to cover a class's full variations, and (2)
Inter-set Inconsistency, where prototypes derived from the support set are
misaligned with the query feature space. Motivated by the powerful generative
capability of diffusion model, we re-purpose its pre-trained conditional
encoder to provide a novel source of generalizable features for expanding the
prototype's representational range. Under this setup, we introduce the
Prototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity
prototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream
learner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic
Learner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel
Diffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting
dual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM),
which adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively
align the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration
Mechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets
demonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various few-shot settings.

Motivation: Existing instruction-based image editing methods fail to generalize effectively to diverse real-world user instructions outside their training domain, limiting practical applications.

Method: Two key designs: (1) model-level toolkit with diverse models trained on limited data and image manipulation functions for fine-grained composition, (2) three-stage progressive reinforcement learning using feedback on unannotated open-domain instructions to train MLLM.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench, exhibits robust reasoning capabilities for open-domain instructions, and can utilize newly introduced editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Lego-Edit successfully addresses the generalization challenge in instruction-based image editing by leveraging MLLM capabilities and a progressive reinforcement learning approach, demonstrating strong performance across diverse real-world instructions.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its
direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are
immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to
instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical
application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the
generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge.
Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising
diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image

the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach
that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM,
equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world

Motivation: Rectified flow models have superior generative performance but suffer from low inversion accuracy (hindering source image consistency) and entangled multimodal attention in diffusion transformers (hindering precise attention control).

Method: 1) High-order inversion method based on Runge-Kutta solver for differential equations to improve inversion accuracy. 2) Decoupled Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA) mechanism that disentangles text and image attention in multimodal diffusion transformers.

Result: Extensive experiments on image reconstruction and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both fidelity and editability.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address the two major challenges of rectified flow models, achieving superior performance in image consistency and precise semantic control for real-world applications.

Abstract: Rectified flow (RF) models have recently demonstrated superior generative
performance compared to DDIM-based diffusion models. However, in real-world
applications, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) low inversion accuracy
that hinders the consistency with the source image, and (2) entangled
multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, which hinders precise attention
control. To address the first challenge, we propose an efficient high-order
inversion method for rectified flow models based on the Runge-Kutta solver of
differential equations. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce Decoupled
Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA), a novel mechanism that disentangles
text and image attention inside the multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling
more precise semantic control. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction
and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity and editability. Code is

TL;DR: MEJO framework addresses surgical triplet recognition challenges through shared-specific disentangled learning and coordinated gradient learning, achieving superior performance on surgical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical triplet recognition faces inter-task optimization conflicts from entangled representations and intra-task conflicts from class-imbalanced data, requiring a comprehensive solution.

Method: Proposes MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) with Shared-Specific-Disentangled learning for representation decomposition and Coordinated Gradient Learning for class imbalance handling, using MLLM-powered probabilistic prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments on CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets demonstrate the framework's superiority in handling optimization conflicts and improving recognition performance.

Conclusion: The MEJO framework effectively mitigates both inter-task and intra-task optimization conflicts in surgical triplet recognition, providing a robust solution for complex surgical scene understanding with imbalanced data.

Abstract: Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb,
target, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding
challenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task
learning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown
promising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1)
inter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and
task-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to
class-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the
MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and
intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task
optimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning
scheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific
components. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically
augment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally,
comprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering
the temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities.
To tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient
Learning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative
gradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning
behaviors. Extensive experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, validating its
effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work lacks holistic evaluation and doesn't require the Guide to infer the Navigator's location, making communication non-essential. DialNav aims to address this gap by creating a task where communication is crucial for success.

Method: Collected and released the RAIN dataset with human-human dialog paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. Designed a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both navigation and dialog performance.

Result: Extensive experiments analyzed the impact of different Navigator and Guide models, highlighting key challenges in the collaborative task.

Conclusion: The dataset, code, and evaluation framework are publicly released to foster future research in embodied dialog navigation tasks.

Abstract: We introduce DialNav, a novel collaborative embodied dialog task, where a
navigation agent (Navigator) and a remote guide (Guide) engage in multi-turn
dialog to reach a goal location. Unlike prior work, DialNav aims for holistic
evaluation and requires the Guide to infer the Navigator's location, making
communication essential for task success. To support this task, we collect and
release the Remote Assistance in Navigation (RAIN) dataset, human-human dialog

### [68] [Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing: Enhancing Visual Understanding via Sustained Focus on Key Objects in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12897)
*Jianfei Zhao,Feng Zhang,Xin Sun,Lingxing Kong,Zhixing Tan,Chong Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS) improves LVLMs by maintaining sustained attention on key objects through a vision memory mechanism that smooths attention distribution across layers, achieving state-of-the-art performance on visual understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs can locate key objects but their attention is brief. The hypothesis is that sustained focus on key objects can enhance visual capabilities.

Method: CLVS incorporates a vision memory that smooths attention distribution across layers. It initializes with position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer, then updates iteratively across subsequent layers while using uncertainty to terminate smoothing when visual understanding is complete.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs show CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in relation and attribute understanding tasks.

Conclusion: CLVS effectively enhances LVLMs' visual capabilities by maintaining sustained attention on key objects through cross-layer vision smoothing, demonstrating strong generalizability across different models and tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can accurately locate key objects in
images, yet their attention to these objects tends to be very brief. Motivated
by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual
capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of
CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution
across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with
position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers,
the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous
layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth
attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in
the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of
completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly.
Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant
improvements in relation and attribute understanding.

### [69] [MSGFusion: Multimodal Scene Graph-Guided Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12901)
*Guihui Li,Bowei Dong,Kaizhi Dong,Jiayi Li,Haiyong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSGFusion is a novel infrared and visible image fusion framework that uses structured scene graphs to explicitly model entities, attributes, and spatial relationships, achieving superior fusion performance through hierarchical semantic refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning fusion methods rely too much on low-level visual cues and struggle with high-level semantic information. Existing text-guided approaches use unstructured descriptions without explicit modeling of entities, attributes, and relationships, limiting fine-grained fusion performance.

Method: MSGFusion uses multimodal scene graphs derived from text and vision to explicitly represent entities, attributes, and spatial relations. It employs successive modules for scene graph representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion to synchronously refine high-level semantics and low-level details.

Result: Extensive experiments show MSGFusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation and structural clarity. It delivers superior semantic consistency and generalizability in downstream tasks like low-light object detection, semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

Conclusion: The structured scene graph approach effectively bridges the gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantic information, providing a robust framework for infrared and visible image fusion with strong performance across multiple applications.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing
to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh
environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable
advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they
still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast,
and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images.
Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have
relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities,
attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby
limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for
infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs
derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities,
attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level
semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph
representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation
and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and
generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection,
semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

*Branko Mitic,Philipp Seeböck,Helmut Prosch,Georg Langs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel generative anomaly detection method using image-to-image translation and patch similarity scoring that improves lesion segmentation in medical imaging across different modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early disease detection and precise anomaly localization in medical imaging is challenging due to normal tissue variability, especially in pulmonary anatomy. Existing generative AD methods struggle with fine-grained anatomical variations.

Method: Proposes a two-stage approach: 1) image-to-image translation for anomaly-free reconstruction, and 2) patch similarity scoring between observed and generated image pairs for precise anomaly localization.

Result: Achieved improved pixel-level anomaly segmentation with relative DICE score improvements of +1.9% on chest CTs (infectious disease lesions) and +4.4% on brain MRIs (ischemic stroke lesions) compared to state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses normal tissue variability challenges in medical anomaly detection and demonstrates strong generalizability across different imaging modalities and medical conditions.

Abstract: Early detection of newly emerging diseases, lesion severity assessment,
differentiation of medical conditions and automated screening are examples for
the wide applicability and importance of anomaly detection (AD) and
unsupervised segmentation in medicine. Normal fine-grained tissue variability
such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing
generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach
addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for
anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between
observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We
validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the
detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess
generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion
segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level
anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score
improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other
state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

*Hojat Ardi,Amir Jahanshahi,Ali Diba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-SiamTPN enhances SiamTPN with temporal modeling to address limitations in aerial object tracking, achieving 13.7% higher success rate and 14.7% better precision while maintaining real-time performance on embedded devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing aerial trackers overlook temporal dependencies and struggle with complex appearance changes due to linear correlation operations in Siamese frameworks, limiting robustness in long-term tracking and occlusion scenarios.

Method: Extends SiamTPN architecture with temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions to strengthen temporal consistency and enable richer feature representations while preserving computational efficiency.

Result: Significant improvements over baseline: 13.7% higher success rate and 14.7% better precision. Runs at 7.1 FPS on Jetson Nano, demonstrating real-time capability for embedded applications without runtime overhead.

Conclusion: Temporal modeling is crucial for Siamese tracking frameworks. T-SiamTPN establishes itself as a strong, efficient solution for aerial object tracking that balances performance and computational efficiency for real-world applications.

Abstract: Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations,
dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing
trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies,
resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion.
Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by
the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against
complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we
introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends
the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach
incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions,
strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations.
These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve
performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the
added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed
on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1
FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without
notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains:
compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and
precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal
modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and
efficient solution for aerial object tracking. Code is available at:

### [72] [A Novel Compression Framework for YOLOv8: Achiev-ing Real-Time Aerial Object Detection on Edge Devices via Structured Pruning and Channel-Wise Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12918)
*Melika Sabaghian,Mohammad Ali Keyvanrad,Seyyedeh Mahila Moghadami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-stage compression pipeline for YOLOv8 that combines sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and knowledge distillation, achieving 73.51% parameter reduction with minimal accuracy loss while boosting inference speed from 26 to 68 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without compromising performance.

Method: Three-stage compression pipeline: 1) Sparsity-aware training with dynamic sparsity, 2) Structured channel pruning using batch normalization scaling factors, 3) Channel-Wise Knowledge Distillation with adjustable temperature and loss weighting for small/medium object detection.

Result: YOLOv8m parameters reduced from 25.85M to 6.85M (73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to 13.3G, MACs from 101G to 34.5G. AP50 reduced by only 2.7% to 47.9, inference speed increased from 26 to 45 FPS. With TensorRT: 47.6 AP50 at 68 FPS.

Conclusion: The approach enables real-time deployment on edge devices with high compression rates and minimal performance degradation, demonstrating practicality for resource-constrained aerial object detection scenarios.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on
resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without
com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage
compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating
sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge
Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity
during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and
detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging
batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels,
significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to
mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer
knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss
weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive
experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model
parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to
13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The
resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from
26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge
devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While
this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly
improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of
our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

### [73] [MATTER: Multiscale Attention for Registration Error Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12924)
*Shipeng Liu,Ziliang Xiong,Khac-Hoang Ngo,Per-Erik Forssén*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a regression-based approach for point cloud registration quality validation, using multiscale feature extraction and attention-based aggregation to provide fine-grained quantification of registration errors, especially effective for point clouds with heterogeneous spatial densities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat point cloud registration validation as a classification task with limited quality classes, which lacks fine-grained quantification. The authors aim to provide more precise registration error estimation through regression instead of classification.

Method: The method uses regression for PCR validation rather than classification, extends misalignment-related features through multiscale extraction, and employs attention-based aggregation for feature processing.

Result: The approach achieves accurate and robust registration error estimation on diverse datasets, particularly for point clouds with heterogeneous spatial densities. When used to guide mapping tasks, it significantly improves mapping quality compared to state-of-the-art classification-based methods.

Conclusion: Regression-based PCR validation with multiscale feature extraction and attention-based aggregation provides superior fine-grained quality quantification and improves downstream mapping performance compared to classification approaches.

Abstract: Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes
detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e.,~{\it PCR quality
validation}, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a
classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this
work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more
fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend
previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction
and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration
error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with
heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping
downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a
given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art
classification-based method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DRadar-GS is a self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework that uses 4D radar data to improve dynamic object reconstruction in autonomous driving scenes by providing accurate motion estimation and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised 3D reconstruction methods struggle with dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak temporal consistency, leading to incomplete or distorted representations in driving scenarios.

Method: Proposes a 4D Radar-assisted Gaussian initialization scheme for dynamic object segmentation and depth scale recovery, plus a Velocity-guided PointTrack model for fine-grained trajectory tracking with scene flow supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset.

Conclusion: 4DRadar-GS effectively addresses dynamic object reconstruction challenges by leveraging 4D radar's velocity and spatial information, providing accurate and temporally consistent 3D representations for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating
autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent
self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated
bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely
on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately
reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak
temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of
dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a
4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for
dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted
Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial
information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale,
generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a
Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the
reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained
dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations.
Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.

*Abdalla Arafa,Didier Stricker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method that enables accurate 3D open-vocabulary object understanding in Gaussian Splatting scenes by using object-level CLIP feature aggregation instead of differentiable rendering for semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting produces photorealistic rendering but lacks semantic understanding capabilities due to alpha blending limitations that average semantics across objects, restricting AR/VR and robotics applications.

Method: Leverages predecomposed object-level Gaussians and represents each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation to create comprehensive 'bags of embeddings' that holistically describe objects, bypassing differentiable rendering for semantics.

Result: Enables accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text queries to object-level embeddings, and supports seamless task adaptation for both 2D segmentation and 3D extraction.

Conclusion: The method effectively overcomes 3D open-vocabulary object extraction challenges while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in 2D open-vocabulary segmentation with minimal compromise.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the
inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene
understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics.
While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model
distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages
semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose
a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for
semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level
Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation,
creating comprehensive "bags of embeddings" that holistically describe objects.
This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text
queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task
adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to
Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction
while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D
open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.

TL;DR: TMKT is a novel fine-grained mixing strategy that interpolates RGB and DVS inputs at various time-steps to enable smoother knowledge transfer between modalities for spiking neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras and spiking neural networks offer energy-efficient visual processing, but limited event data availability and sparse DVS outputs create training challenges. Existing methods overlook the significant distribution gap between RGB and DVS modalities.

Method: Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT) exploits SNN's asynchronous nature by interpolating RGB and DVS inputs at different time-steps, with modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives to support cross-modal label mixing.

Result: The approach enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training, and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: TMKT effectively bridges the modality gap between RGB and DVS data for spiking neural networks, demonstrating promising results for energy-efficient visual processing with event cameras.

Abstract: The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks holds great
promise for energy-efficient visual processing. However, the limited
availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges
for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer
semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the
significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we
propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing
strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and
DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal
scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives.
These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's
ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach
enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training,
and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across
multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review
process.

TL;DR: A Dual-Stage Reweighted Mixture-of-Experts framework for detecting subtle and infrequent user action mistakes from egocentric video, using feature-level and classification-level expert fusion with specialized loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting subtle and infrequent mistakes in user actions from egocentric video data, where traditional methods struggle with class imbalance and ambiguous instances.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Feature extraction using frozen ViViT and LoRA-tuned ViViT models combined through feature-level expert module; 2) Three classifiers with reweighted cross-entropy, AUC loss, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization, fused via classification-level expert module.

Result: Achieves strong performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances from egocentric video data.

Conclusion: The DR-MoE framework effectively handles class imbalance and subtle mistake detection in egocentric video analysis through its dual-stage expert fusion approach and specialized loss functions.

Abstract: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs
an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges
posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted
Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are
extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are
combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three
classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to
mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed
distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to
enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a
classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong
performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for interactive multi-surface segmentation using user clicks and multi-modal inputs, with a novel network architecture that integrates RGB images, non-RGB modalities, and user interactions to predict improved segmentation masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of segmenting multiple entangled surfaces in the same image through interactive user clicks, while handling complex scenarios where surfaces are heavily adjacent and require multi-modal inputs for better segmentation.

Method: A network architecture that takes RGB images, non-RGB modalities, erroneous masks, and encoded clicks as input to predict improved segmentation masks. The design ensures RGB backbone remains black-box and integrates interaction-specific information after feature extraction to reduce response time.

Result: The method reduces NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on DeLiVER and up to 1.19 on MFNet. The RGB-only baseline also shows competitive and sometimes superior performance in classical single-mask interactive segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-modal fusion strategy is effective for interactive segmentation of multiple surfaces, demonstrating significant improvements in efficiency and performance across different datasets.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to interactively create segmentation masks
on the basis of user clicks. We pay particular attention to the segmentation of
multiple surfaces that are simultaneously present in the same image. Since
these surfaces may be heavily entangled and adjacent, we also present a novel
extended evaluation metric that accounts for the challenges of this scenario.
Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to
facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network
architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities,
an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network
predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it
adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a
black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the
interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the
multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface
interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our
multi-modal fusion strategy. Using additional modalities, our system reduces
the NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on average on DeLiVER and up to
1.19 on MFNet. On top of this, we are able to show that our RGB-only baseline
achieves competitive, and in some cases even superior performance when tested
in a classical, single-mask interactive segmentation scenario.

*Yan Chen,Long Li,Teng Xi,Long Zeng,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage RL framework for vision-language models that enhances both visual perception and reasoning capabilities, addressing the complexity of VLM tasks compared to LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly applying RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal because VLMs face more complex tasks requiring accurate visual perception before reasoning can occur.

Method: Two-stage RL framework with dataset-level sampling to mitigate vanishing advantage. First stage improves visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained understanding. Second stage enhances reasoning abilities.

Result: PeBR-R1 model achieves superior performance across seven benchmark datasets, demonstrating significantly enhanced perceptual and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage RL approach effectively addresses the unique challenges of VLMs and produces a model with strong performance across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this
success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to
vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance.
However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as
the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must
first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be
effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage
reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing
advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform
dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using
distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving
the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual
understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning
abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we
obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual
and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior
performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical handwritten documents present unique challenges for text line segmentation due to irregular handwriting, faded ink, complex layouts, and scarcity of large annotated datasets, making supervised learning impractical.

Method: The competition uses the U-DIADS-TL dataset featuring diverse ancient manuscripts with various layouts, degradation levels, and non-standard formatting. Participants develop systems that learn from only three annotated images per manuscript.

Result: The competition framework is established to evaluate few-shot learning approaches for text line segmentation in challenging historical documents.

Conclusion: FEST competition aims to promote robust and adaptable few-shot learning methods that enable humanities scholars to use automated document analysis tools with minimal manual annotation effort, facilitating broader adoption in historical research.

Abstract: Text line segmentation is a critical step in handwritten document image
analysis. Segmenting text lines in historical handwritten documents, however,
presents unique challenges due to irregular handwriting, faded ink, and complex
layouts with overlapping lines and non-linear text flow. Furthermore, the
scarcity of large annotated datasets renders fully supervised learning
approaches impractical for such materials. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Few-Shot Text Line Segmentation of Ancient Handwritten Documents
(FEST) Competition. Participants are tasked with developing systems capable of
segmenting text lines in U-DIADS-TL dataset, using only three annotated images
per manuscript for training. The competition dataset features a diverse
collection of ancient manuscripts exhibiting a wide range of layouts,
degradation levels, and non-standard formatting, closely reflecting real-world
conditions. By emphasizing few-shot learning, FEST competition aims to promote
the development of robust and adaptable methods that can be employed by
humanities scholars with minimal manual annotation effort, thus fostering
broader adoption of automated document analysis tools in historical research.

Motivation: To evaluate and compare protein surface shape retrieval methods using electrostatic potential as a key molecular surface descriptor, and to understand the importance of complementary surface descriptors.

Method: Evaluation of 15 different retrieval methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated electrostatic potential, using multiple metrics including Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall.

Result: The best retrieval performance was achieved by methods that used electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This advantage was particularly evident for classes with limited data.

Conclusion: Incorporating additional molecular surface descriptors like electrostatic potential alongside shape information significantly improves protein surface retrieval performance, especially for underrepresented protein classes.

Abstract: This SHREC 2025 track dedicated to protein surface shape retrieval involved 9
participating teams. We evaluated the performance in retrieval of 15 proposed
methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated
electrostatic potential (a key molecular surface descriptor). The performance
in retrieval of the proposed methods was evaluated through different metrics
(Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall). The best
retrieval performance was achieved by the proposed methods that used the
electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This
observation was also valid for classes with limited data which highlights the
importance of taking into account additional molecular surface descriptors.

*Qianqi Lu,Yuxiang Xie,Jing Zhang,Shiwei Zou,Yan Chen,Xidao Luan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TFANet is a three-stage network that addresses multimodal misalignment in Referring Image Segmentation through hierarchical feature alignment modules at different scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RIS methods struggle with multimodal misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes with multiple visually similar objects, leading to mislocalization and incomplete segmentation.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Knowledge Plus Stage with Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module for bidirectional semantic exchange, 2) Knowledge Fusion Stage with Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module for long-range dependency modeling, 3) Knowledge Intensification Stage with Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided Semantic Deepening Module to compensate for semantic degradation.

Result: The proposed method systematically enhances multimodal alignment through hierarchical feature processing across multiple scales and granularities.

Conclusion: TFANet provides a comprehensive solution for improving multimodal alignment in complex RIS scenarios by addressing both feature alignment and semantic preservation through its three-stage architecture.

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a task that segments image regions
based on language expressions, requiring fine-grained alignment between two
modalities. However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal
misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes
containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets
are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these
challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature
Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a
hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),
Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the
first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM),
which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and
textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and
efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of
linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature
alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies
multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct
a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range
cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.
Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided
Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation
introduced in earlier stages.

*Hemanth Chandravamsi,Dhanush V. Shenoy,Steven H. Frankel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WINNER addresses SIREN's spectral bottleneck by using adaptive Gaussian noise initialization based on target signal's spectral centroid, achieving state-of-the-art performance without extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SIRENs struggle with signals outside their frequency support, causing spectral bottleneck where networks produce near-zero outputs even for frequencies they can represent.

Method: WINNER perturbs uniformly initialized SIREN weights with Gaussian noise, where noise scales are adaptively determined by the target signal's spectral centroid.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape fitting tasks over base SIREN, without introducing additional trainable parameters.

Conclusion: WINNER overcomes SIREN's spectral limitations and suggests new adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for deep neural network optimization.

Abstract: We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation
networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann
et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting
signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the
network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral
bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero
output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its
representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight
Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly
initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are
adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to
random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without
introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape
fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new
avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep
neural network training. For code and data visit

### [86] [Curriculum Multi-Task Self-Supervision Improves Lightweight Architectures for Onboard Satellite Hyperspectral Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13229)
*Hugo Carlesso,Josiane Mothe,Radu Tudor Ionescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning framework (CMTSSL) for lightweight hyperspectral imaging analysis that combines masked image modeling with spatial/spectral jigsaw puzzles, achieving strong performance with models 16,000x lighter than state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral imaging produces high-dimensional data but satellite systems have slow data transfer rates, requiring compact models for onboard processing to minimize transmission of redundant data like cloud-covered areas.

Method: CMTSSL integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw puzzle solving, guided by curriculum learning that progressively increases data complexity during self-supervision.

Result: Validated on four public benchmark datasets, the approach shows consistent gains in downstream segmentation tasks using architectures over 16,000x lighter than state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: CMTSSL enables effective representation learning for real-world HSI applications with lightweight models suitable for onboard satellite deployment, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across
hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing
applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and
environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the
slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient
models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission
of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we
introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)
framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL
integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw
puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively
increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to
jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global
semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously
addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally
efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models
for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public
benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation
tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some
state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in
generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for
real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at

### [87] [Brought a Gun to a Knife Fight: Modern VFM Baselines Outgun Specialized Detectors on In-the-Wild AI Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12995)
*Yue Zhou,Xinan He,Kaiqing Lin,Bing Fan,Feng Ding,Jinhua Zeng,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple linear classifier on modern Vision Foundation Models outperforms specialized AI-generated image detectors by over 20% in real-world scenarios, due to VFMs' learned alignment with forgery concepts through data exposure during pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized AI-generated image detectors perform well on curated benchmarks but fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios with high false-negative rates, indicating a need for more robust detection methods.

Method: Using a simple linear classifier on top of modern Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) trained on identical data as specialized detectors, and analyzing text-image similarities to understand why VFMs perform better.

Result: The VFM-based baseline decisively outperforms bespoke detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by over 20%. The performance is attributed to recent VLMs learning to align synthetic images with forgery-related concepts through data exposure during pre-training.

Conclusion: Modern VFMs provide more effective detection than specialized static detectors for real-world AI-generated image detection, and true generalization evaluation requires test data independent of the model's entire training history including pre-training.

Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated
benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by
their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead
of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to
the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model
(VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke
detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.
  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing
text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder,
Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related
concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate
that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy
plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date,
ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical
conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection,
the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the
`craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation
requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history,
including pre-training.

*Mattia Soldan,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Bernard Ghanem,Josef Sivic,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResidualViT: A vision transformer architecture that reduces computational cost for temporally dense video tasks by leveraging temporal redundancy, achieving 60% cost reduction and 2.5x speedup while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporally dense video tasks require high frame-rate processing which is computationally expensive. Current methods struggle with the cost of computing frame-level features at high temporal resolution.

Method: Proposes ResidualViT with learnable residual connections for temporal consistency and token reduction module to discard redundant information. Uses lightweight distillation to approximate original foundation model features.

Result: Achieves up to 60% reduction in computational cost and 2.5x faster inference speed across 4 tasks and 5 datasets, while closely matching the accuracy of the original foundation model in both zero-shot and supervised settings.

Conclusion: ResidualViT effectively reduces computational burden for temporally dense video tasks by exploiting temporal redundancy, making high-resolution video processing more efficient without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video
grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation,
require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal
resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is
computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this
paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for
temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)
architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy
in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our
architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure
temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction
module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally
redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.
Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the
frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our
approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully
supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost
(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while
closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small drones pose increasing threats to military and civilian infrastructure, requiring automated detection systems that can operate efficiently in contested areas with limited power infrastructure.

Method: Developed a fully neuromorphic system using spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras (event cameras) deployed on neuromorphic chips. Multiple detection units create virtual tripwires, and synthetic data was used for training.

Result: The system is several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than GPU-based solutions, capable of running over a year on battery power. The model primarily relies on drone shape rather than propeller temporal characteristics.

Conclusion: The neuromorphic approach provides a compact, low-power solution suitable for deployment in areas lacking infrastructure, offering long-term autonomous drone detection capabilities.

Abstract: Small drones are an increasing threat to both military personnel and civilian
infrastructure, making early and automated detection crucial. In this work we
develop a system that uses spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras
(event cameras) to detect drones. The detection model is deployed on a
neuromorphic chip making this a fully neuromorphic system. Multiple detection
units can be deployed to create a virtual tripwire which detects when and where
drones enter a restricted zone. We show that our neuromorphic solution is
several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference solution
deployed on an edge GPU, allowing the system to run for over a year on battery
power. We investigate how synthetically generated data can be used for
training, and show that our model most likely relies on the shape of the drone
rather than the temporal characteristics of its propellers. The small size and
low power consumption allows easy deployment in contested areas or locations
that lack power infrastructure.

Motivation: Traditional radiology training lacks scalable, immediate feedback opportunities, limiting effective skill development in localization and report writing.

Method: Combines gamification with public datasets and AI-driven feedback. RadGame Localize uses bounding box drawing compared to radiologist annotations with visual explanations. RadGame Report provides structured AI feedback on report writing using radiology report generation metrics.

Result: Participants achieved 68% improvement in localization accuracy (vs 17% with traditional methods) and 31% improvement in report-writing accuracy (vs 4% with traditional methods).

Conclusion: AI-driven gamification shows strong potential for scalable, feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines medical AI applications in education.

Abstract: We introduce RadGame, an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education
that targets two core skills: localizing findings and generating reports.
Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active
practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting
opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap
by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated,
AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners.
In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which
are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public
datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for
user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest
X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on
radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared
to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing
a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants
using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to
17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing
accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases.
RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable,

*Gaofeng Liu,Hengsen Li,Ruoyu Gao,Xuetong Li,Zhiyuan Ma,Tao Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dream3DAvatar is a two-stage framework that generates high-quality 3D avatars from single images using adapter-enhanced multi-view generation and transformer-based 3D reconstruction with text control capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-image 3D avatar reconstruction remains fundamentally ill-posed due to limited monocular information, making it difficult to control geometry and texture of occluded regions during generation.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Lightweight adapter-enhanced multi-view generation with Pose-Adapter for geometric consistency and ID-Adapter-G for facial identity preservation, plus BLIP2 for text descriptions; 2) Feedforward Transformer with multi-view feature fusion and ID-Adapter-R for 3D Gaussian Splat reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method generates realistic, animation-ready 3D avatars without post-processing and consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Dream3DAvatar provides an efficient and text-controllable solution for high-fidelity 3D avatar generation from single images, addressing occlusion challenges through innovative adapter mechanisms and multi-view consistency.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D representation techniques and generative
models, substantial progress has been made in reconstructing full-body 3D
avatars from a single image. However, this task remains fundamentally
ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input,
making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions
during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction
pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable
two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a
lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we
introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information
into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve
facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution
facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to
generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing
text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design
a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion
module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS)
from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which
utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the
reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic, animation-ready
3D avatars without any post-processing and consistently outperforms existing
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: HERO is a training-free framework that reduces computational overhead in HR-LVLMs by selectively dropping less important visual tokens based on content-adaptive importance estimation and function-aware selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution LVLMs generate excessive visual tokens through tile-based processing, causing significant computational and memory overhead that needs to be addressed for efficient inference.

Method: Proposes HERO framework with content-adaptive token budget allocation and function-aware token selection based on empirical findings about varying tile importance and CLIP encoder's two-stage attention patterns.

Result: Achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs across diverse benchmarks and model scales without requiring training.

Conclusion: Provides both empirical insights into visual token utilization and a practical training-free solution for efficient inference in high-resolution vision-language models.

Abstract: By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them
independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities.
However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of
visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To
better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual
token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local
tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task
relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage
attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types
of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode
information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles
within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution
visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token
budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating
tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with
complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs
across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This
study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient
inference in HR-LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLFDisc is a U-shaped deep enhancement network that uses cross-attention and gating mechanisms for frequency-aware enhancement, with a novel distribution-aware loss using KL-Divergence for Fourier-domain fitting and improved perceptual loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Fourier frequency fitting uses pixel-wise loss functions that focus too much on local information and cause global information loss. The paper aims to better preserve both amplitude (luminance) and phase (spatial structure) information in the Fourier domain.

Method: Proposes LLFDisc - a U-shaped deep enhancement network with cross-attention and gating mechanisms. Introduces a distribution-aware loss using closed-form KL-Divergence for Fourier-domain fitting, and enhances VGG-based perceptual loss with KL-Divergence on deep features.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of traditional Fourier frequency fitting by using distribution-aware losses and achieves superior performance in frequency-aware enhancement tasks.

Abstract: In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the
amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase
components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs
pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information
and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a
U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating
mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel
distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and
minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This
enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with
conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss
based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling
better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation framework that uses cross consistency enhancement and self-supervised contrastive learning to reduce noisy pseudo-labels and improve segmentation performance with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised medical image segmentation requires large labeled datasets which are impractical in real-world scenarios. Existing semi-supervised methods suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and insufficient feature space supervision.

Method: Dual-network architecture with Cross Consistency Enhancement module using cross pseudo and entropy-filtered supervision, dynamic weighting strategy with uncertainty-aware mechanism (KL divergence), and self-supervised contrastive learning to align uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes.

Result: Achieved 89.95% Dice score on Left Atrial dataset with only 10% labeled data, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods across three 3D segmentation datasets (Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas, BraTS-2019).

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses noisy pseudo-labels and insufficient supervision in semi-supervised medical image segmentation, demonstrating superior performance and validated through ablation studies.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of supervised medical image segmentation
models, relying on a large amount of labeled data is impractical in real-world
situations. Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge
using unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing
semi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and
insufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation
framework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a
Cross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and
entropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design
a dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using
an uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In
addition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align
uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively
differentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing
prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D
segmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019. The proposed
approach consistently exhibits superior performance across various settings
(e.g., 89.95\% Dice score on left Atrial with 10\% labeled data) compared to
the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed
modules is further validated via ablation experiments.

*Jonas Werheid,Shengjie He,Aymen Gannouni,Anas Abdelrazeq,Robert H. Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic data generation from CAD models enables efficient visual assembly control with high accuracy (up to 99.5% mAP on synthetic data, 93% on real data), making computer vision quality control accessible to SMEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computer vision assembly control requires expensive image acquisition, annotation, and training that small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) cannot afford, creating a need for more accessible solutions.

Method: Leverages simulated scene generation based on CAD data and object detection algorithms to create synthetic training data, reducing manual data collection and labeling requirements.

Result: Achieved mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95) up to 99.5% on synthetic planetary gear system components and 93% when transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation provides an effective, time-saving pipeline for visual assembly control that can support SMEs in implementing resource-efficient quality control solutions.

Abstract: Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure
not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration
into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control
using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs
associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision
algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive
training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers
the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its
practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In
this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient
visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation
based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The
results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in
manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95)
up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear
system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when
transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research
highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable
pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing
resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.

*Ruibo Li,Hanyu Shi,Zhe Wang,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion prediction from LiDAR using foreground/background or non-ground/ground masks as supervision, reducing annotation effort while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous driving, but motion annotations are expensive. Outdoor scenes consist of mobile foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be associated with scene parsing.

Method: Proposes weakly supervised paradigm using fully/partially annotated foreground/background masks (1%, 0.1%) or non-ground/ground masks (0.01%) for supervision. Develops approaches utilizing these cues to guide self-supervised learning. Designs Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss with multi-frame information and robust penalty functions.

Result: Weakly and self-supervised models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts. Weakly supervised models rival some supervised ones, effectively balancing annotation effort and performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches demonstrate that motion prediction can be effectively learned with minimal or no motion annotations by leveraging scene parsing cues, making class-agnostic motion prediction more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous
driving, thereby motivating research on class-agnostic motion prediction. In
this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion
prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile
foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be
associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel
weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or
partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To
this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing
foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion
prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground
regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to
foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging
non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly
supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations,
and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a
Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame
information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in
self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised
models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly
supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our
approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.

### [97] [Advancing Real-World Parking Slot Detection with Large-Scale Dataset and Semi-Supervised Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13133)
*Zhihao Zhang,Chunyu Lin,Lang Nie,Jiyuan Wang,Yao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CRPS-D, a large-scale parking slot detection dataset with diverse real-world conditions, and SS-PSD, the first semi-supervised method for parking slot detection using teacher-student model with confidence-guided consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parking slot detection datasets are limited in scale and lack real-world noise variations. Manual annotation is error-prone and expensive for large datasets, creating a need for better datasets and methods that can leverage unlabeled data.

Method: Constructed CRPS-D dataset with diverse lighting, weather conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Developed SS-PSD semi-supervised approach using teacher-student model with confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.

Result: SS-PSD outperforms state-of-the-art solutions on both the proposed CRPS-D dataset and existing datasets. Performance gains increase with more unlabeled data availability.

Conclusion: The proposed CRPS-D dataset and SS-PSD semi-supervised method significantly advance parking slot detection by addressing dataset limitations and leveraging unlabeled data effectively, with publicly available resources for community use.

Abstract: As automatic parking systems evolve, the accurate detection of parking slots
has become increasingly critical. This study focuses on parking slot detection
using surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the
parking environment. However, the current datasets are limited in scale, and
the scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light,
occlusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and
omissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly
increasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these
issues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named
CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather
conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing
datasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a
higher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking
slots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot
detection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting
unlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in
parking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with
confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing
state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing
dataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant
the gains brought by our semi-supervised scheme. The relevant source codes and
the dataset have been made publicly available at

*Minqing Huang,Shouyi Lu,Boyuan Zheng,Ziyao Li,Xiao Tang,Guirong Zhuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSDNet is a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers LiDAR priors to 4D radar features for high-quality super-resolution with low latency, using reconstruction and diffusion-guided feature distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D radar super-resolution methods suffer from high training costs, complex diffusion-based sampling, high inference latency, and poor generalization, making it difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Two-stage distillation: 1) Reconstruction-guided feature distillation for feature alignment and densification, 2) Diffusion-guided feature distillation with a lightweight diffusion network and noise adapter for adaptive noise level alignment and refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments on VoD and in-house datasets show MSDNet achieves high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference, with consistent performance improvements on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: MSDNet effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by providing both high reconstruction quality and computational efficiency for 4D radar point cloud super-resolution.

Abstract: 4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point
clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a
foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often
suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling,
resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it
difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers
dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction
quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs
reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the
student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we
propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one
distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and
refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a
noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a
predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves
both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D
radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on
downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

Conclusion: Contextual awareness through the proposed architecture and data selection pipeline enables superior textual attribute recognition performance across diverse multilingual document types.

Abstract: Recognizing textual attributes such as bold, italic, underline and strikeout
is essential for understanding text semantics, structure, and visual
presentation. These attributes highlight key information, making them crucial
for document analysis. Existing methods struggle with computational efficiency
or adaptability in noisy, multilingual settings. To address this, we introduce
TexTAR, a multi-task, context-aware Transformer for Textual Attribute

TL;DR: A multi-video collaborative framework that uses spatio-temporal graphs to represent video knowledge and fuse information from related videos to enhance video language model reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video language models suffer from hallucinations and inaccuracies due to spatio-temporal incompleteness in individual videos, and directly feeding multiple videos to LLMs is inefficient due to redundant video tokens.

Method: Proposes a three-module framework: Video Structuring Module to represent video knowledge as spatio-temporal graphs, Graph Fusion Module to fuse knowledge from related videos into augmented graph node tokens, and multi-video structured prompt construction to integrate graph, visual, and textual tokens for LLM input.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework effectively enhances video language model performance, demonstrating its potential for advancing video reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-video collaborative framework with structured graph representation provides an effective solution to address spatio-temporal incompleteness in video understanding and represents a promising direction for video language model advancement.

Abstract: Despite the prosperity of the video language model, the current pursuit of
comprehensive video reasoning is thwarted by the inherent spatio-temporal
incompleteness within individual videos, resulting in hallucinations and
inaccuracies. A promising solution is to augment the reasoning performance with
multiple related videos. However, video tokens are numerous and contain
redundant information, so directly feeding the relevant video data into a large
language model to enhance responses could be counterproductive. To address this
challenge, we propose a multi-video collaborative framework for video language
models. For efficient and flexible video representation, we establish a Video
Structuring Module to represent the video's knowledge as a spatio-temporal
graph. Based on the structured video representation, we design the Graph Fusion
Module to fuse the structured knowledge and valuable information from related
videos into the augmented graph node tokens. Finally, we construct an elaborate
multi-video structured prompt to integrate the graph, visual, and textual
tokens as the input to the large language model. Extensive experiments
substantiate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its potential as a
promising avenue for advancing video language models.

Conclusion: WHU-STree addresses limitations of existing datasets and enables comprehensive street tree analysis. Future work should focus on multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization, spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Models for urban tree management.

Abstract: Street trees are vital to urban livability, providing ecological and social
benefits. Establishing a detailed, accurate, and dynamically updated street
tree inventory has become essential for optimizing these multifunctional assets
within space-constrained urban environments. Given that traditional field
surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive, automated surveys utilizing
Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) offer a more efficient solution. However, existing
MMS-acquired tree datasets are limited by small-scale scene, limited
annotation, or single modality, restricting their utility for comprehensive
analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce WHU-STree, a cross-city,
richly annotated, and multi-modal urban street tree dataset. Collected across
two distinct cities, WHU-STree integrates synchronized point clouds and
high-resolution images, encompassing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50
species and 2 morphological parameters. Leveraging the unique characteristics,
WHU-STree concurrently supports over 10 tasks related to street tree inventory.
We benchmark representative baselines for two key tasks--tree species
classification and individual tree segmentation. Extensive experiments and
in-depth analysis demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modal data
fusion and underscore cross-domain applicability as a critical prerequisite for
practical algorithm deployment. In particular, we identify key challenges and
outline potential future works for fully exploiting WHU-STree, encompassing
multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization,
spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model for street tree
asset management. The WHU-STree dataset is accessible at:

TL;DR: LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels from radiology reports with high accuracy (>96% AUC), enabling cost-effective creation of large-scale medical datasets for vision-language pre-training that achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models present unprecedented opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language pre-training by enabling large-scale supervised pre-training and advancing vision-language alignment in medical AI systems.

Method: Using LLMs to automatically extract diagnostic labels from radiology reports without complex prompt engineering, creating "silver-standard" datasets at minimal cost (~$3 for 50k CT image-report pairs), then training vision encoders with vanilla CLIP training on 3D ResNet-18.

Result: Achieved 83.8% AUC for zero-shot diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2% for report-image). Performance comparable to specialized BERT-based models.

Conclusion: LLMs can facilitate more performant and scalable medical AI systems by democratizing access to large-scale supervised pre-training and fundamentally improving contrastive vision-language alignment in medical applications.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented
opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language
pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale
supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin
by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels
from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments)
without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale
"silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report
pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard"
dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by
specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale
supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that
supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language
alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D
ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot
diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements
in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for

Method: The authors curated and adapted four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle video segmentation, evaluated 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based segmentation methods, and introduced two strong baseline methods based on vision foundation models to leverage temporal consistency.

Result: The proposed approach achieved state-of-the-art performance in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video sequences, demonstrating superior consistency and accuracy compared to frame-by-frame methods.

Conclusion: Road-obstacle segmentation is inherently temporal, and leveraging temporal consistency through video-based approaches significantly improves segmentation quality and consistency, providing valuable insights and direction for future autonomous driving research.

Abstract: With the growing deployment of autonomous driving agents, the detection and
segmentation of road obstacles have become critical to ensure safe autonomous
navigation. However, existing road-obstacle segmentation methods are applied on
individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to
inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we
demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal,
since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To
address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle
video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based
segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong
baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a

Abstract: Violence detection in public surveillance is critical for public safety. This
study addresses challenges such as small-scale targets, complex environments,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have advanced image synthesis but raise concerns about malicious misuse. Existing approaches struggle to detect images generated by diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar images are in training data.

Method: End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4) with a denoising reconstruction model to align latent spaces, and a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local features using attention pyramid layers at different scales.

Result: End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. A comprehensive benchmark with five distinct masked regions was established for evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed End4 method successfully addresses the challenge of detecting diffusion-based inpainted images and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across different masking patterns and perturbations.

Abstract: The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly
advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and
inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements,
diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious
purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by
diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are
included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically,
End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree
between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus
reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it
leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local
image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different
scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection
performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark
comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking
patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset
will be released soon.

generating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D
assets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose
StyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D
assets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous
works, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,
enabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or
both styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a
novel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a
dynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for
style-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling
stable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate
semantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature
selection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of
3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,
allowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With
SD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or
both-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we
further propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables
exclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style
intensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor
outperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets.

TL;DR: SR-3D is a vision-language model that bridges 2D images and 3D data through shared visual tokens, enabling flexible region prompting and accurate spatial reasoning across frames without multi-frame labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To connect single-view 2D images with multi-view 3D data and enable flexible spatial region annotation without exhaustive multi-frame labeling requirements.

Method: Enriches 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings, allowing the 3D model to leverage strong 2D priors for spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects don't co-occur in the same view.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both general 2D vision language and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness in unifying 2D and 3D representation spaces.

Conclusion: SR-3D successfully bridges 2D and 3D understanding, works with in-the-wild videos without 3D inputs or annotations, and accurately infers spatial relationships and metric measurements.

Abstract: We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that
connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual
token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to
annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or
directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We
achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings,
which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate
spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur
within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language
and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D
and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe
applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth
3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric
measurements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: New resources for Dutch embeddings: MTEB-NL benchmark, training dataset with synthetic data, and E5-NL embedding models to address Dutch language underrepresentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dutch language is underrepresented in multilingual embedding resources, typically comprising only a small fraction of published resources.

Method: Created MTEB-NL benchmark with existing and new Dutch datasets, compiled training dataset from Dutch retrieval datasets with synthetic LLM-generated data, and developed compact E5-NL embedding models.

Result: Developed comprehensive evaluation benchmark, enhanced training dataset, and efficient embedding models specifically for Dutch language processing.

Conclusion: The released resources (benchmark, dataset, and models) address the Dutch representation gap and support further development of Dutch embeddings, available publicly through Hugging Face Hub and MTEB package.

Abstract: Recently, embedding resources, including models, benchmarks, and datasets,
have been widely released to support a variety of languages. However, the Dutch
language remains underrepresented, typically comprising only a small fraction
of the published multilingual resources. To address this gap and encourage the
further development of Dutch embeddings, we introduce new resources for their
evaluation and generation. First, we introduce the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark for Dutch (MTEB-NL), which includes both existing Dutch datasets and
newly created ones, covering a wide range of tasks. Second, we provide a
training dataset compiled from available Dutch retrieval datasets, complemented
with synthetic data generated by large language models to expand task coverage
beyond retrieval. Finally, we release a series of E5-NL models compact yet
efficient embedding models that demonstrate strong performance across multiple
tasks. We make our resources publicly available through the Hugging Face Hub
and the MTEB package.

### [111] [MORABLES: A Benchmark for Assessing Abstract Moral Reasoning in LLMs with Fables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12371)
*Matteo Marcuzzo,Alessandro Zangari,Andrea Albarelli,Jose Camacho-Collados,Mohammad Taher Pilehvar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MORABLES is a human-verified benchmark using fables and short stories to evaluate LLMs' moral reasoning through multiple-choice questions with adversarial variants, showing that while larger models perform better, they remain brittle and rely on superficial patterns rather than true moral understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs excel on standard reading comprehension, there's a need to evaluate their capacity for complex abstract reasoning and moral inference using literature with rich narrative depth.

Method: Created MORABLES benchmark with human-verified fables and short stories, using multiple-choice questions targeting moral inference with carefully crafted distractors. Introduced adversarial variants to test model robustness and identify vulnerabilities from data contamination.

Result: Larger models outperform smaller ones but remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation, relying on superficial patterns rather than true moral reasoning. Best models contradict themselves in ~20% of cases. Reasoning-enhanced models fail to bridge the performance gap.

Conclusion: Scale, not reasoning ability, is the primary driver of performance. Current LLMs show significant brittleness in moral reasoning and are vulnerable to framing effects, indicating they lack true moral comprehension despite surface-level improvements.

Abstract: As LLMs excel on standard reading comprehension benchmarks, attention is
shifting toward evaluating their capacity for complex abstract reasoning and
inference. Literature-based benchmarks, with their rich narrative and moral
depth, provide a compelling framework for evaluating such deeper comprehension
skills. Here, we present MORABLES, a human-verified benchmark built from fables
and short stories drawn from historical literature. The main task is structured
as multiple-choice questions targeting moral inference, with carefully crafted
distractors that challenge models to go beyond shallow, extractive question
answering. To further stress-test model robustness, we introduce adversarial
variants designed to surface LLM vulnerabilities and shortcuts due to issues
such as data contamination. Our findings show that, while larger models
outperform smaller ones, they remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation
and often rely on superficial patterns rather than true moral reasoning. This
brittleness results in significant self-contradiction, with the best models
refuting their own answers in roughly 20% of cases depending on the framing of
the moral choice. Interestingly, reasoning-enhanced models fail to bridge this
gap, suggesting that scale - not reasoning ability - is the primary driver of
performance.

*Anu Pradhan,Alexandra Ortan,Apurv Verma,Madhavan Seshadri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates using LLMs as judges to evaluate Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal contexts, finding that Gwet's AC2 and rank correlation are better metrics than traditional agreement measures, and proposing a statistically rigorous evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluation metrics fall short in capturing nuanced quality dimensions in specialized domains like legal research, especially with the rise of Generative AI. There's a need for scalable, cost-effective evaluation methods that maintain precision for high-stakes legal applications.

Method: Systematic experimentation to determine which inter-rater reliability metrics best capture alignment between LLM and human assessments, and how to conduct statistically sound comparisons between competing systems using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg corrections.

Result: Traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in skewed distributions typical of AI evaluations. Gwet's AC2 and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge selection.

Conclusion: The research provides a path toward scalable, cost-effective evaluation that maintains legal application precision, transforming human-intensive evaluation bottlenecks into automated yet statistically principled frameworks.

Abstract: The evaluation bottleneck in recommendation systems has become particularly
acute with the rise of Generative AI, where traditional metrics fall short of
capturing nuanced quality dimensions that matter in specialized domains like
legal research. Can we trust Large Language Models to serve as reliable judges
of their own kind? This paper investigates LLM-as-a-Judge as a principled
approach to evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal
contexts, where the stakes of recommendation quality are exceptionally high.
  We tackle two fundamental questions that determine practical viability: which
inter-rater reliability metrics best capture the alignment between LLM and
human assessments, and how do we conduct statistically sound comparisons
between competing systems? Through systematic experimentation, we discover that
traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in
the skewed distributions typical of AI system evaluations. Instead, Gwet's AC2
and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge
selection, while the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg
corrections provides the statistical rigor needed for reliable system
comparisons.
  Our findings suggest a path toward scalable, cost-effective evaluation that
maintains the precision demanded by legal applications, transforming what was
once a human-intensive bottleneck into an automated, yet statistically
principled, evaluation framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SENTRA is a novel Transformer-based detector that uses selected-next-token probabilities and contrastive pre-training to identify LLM-generated text, outperforming existing methods in out-of-domain settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become more capable and widespread, the potential for misuse by generating text without declaration is growing, creating a need for effective detection methods.

Method: SENTRA is a supervised Transformer-based encoder that leverages selected-next-token-probability sequences and utilizes contrastive pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets across 24 text domains show SENTRA significantly outperforms popular baselines in out-of-domain settings, demonstrating its general-purpose capability.

Conclusion: SENTRA provides an effective solution for detecting LLM-generated text that is not explicitly declared, addressing the growing problem of potential misuse through advanced contrastive pre-training and token probability analysis.

Abstract: LLMs are becoming increasingly capable and widespread. Consequently, the
potential and reality of their misuse is also growing. In this work, we address
the problem of detecting LLM-generated text that is not explicitly declared as
such. We present a novel, general-purpose, and supervised LLM text detector,
SElected-Next-Token tRAnsformer (SENTRA). SENTRA is a Transformer-based encoder
leveraging selected-next-token-probability sequences and utilizing contrastive
pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data. Our experiments on three
popular public datasets across 24 domains of text demonstrate SENTRA is a
general-purpose classifier that significantly outperforms popular baselines in
the out-of-domain setting.

### [114] [MORQA: Benchmarking Evaluation Metrics for Medical Open-Ended Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12405)
*Wen-wai Yim,Asma Ben Abacha,Zixuan Yu,Robert Doerning,Fei Xia,Meliha Yetisgen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MORQA is a new multilingual benchmark for evaluating NLG systems in medical QA, featuring expert-authored gold answers and human ratings. LLM-based evaluators like GPT-4 outperform traditional metrics in correlating with expert judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional automatic evaluation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore) are inadequate for medical NLG evaluation due to the need for accuracy, relevance, and domain expertise in open-ended medical QA where multiple valid responses exist.

Method: Created MORQA benchmark with 2-4+ gold-standard answers by medical professionals across three medical visual/text QA datasets in English and Chinese. Compared traditional metrics with LLM-based evaluators (GPT-4, Gemini) against expert human ratings.

Result: LLM-based approaches significantly outperform traditional metrics in correlating with expert judgments. LLMs show better sensitivity to semantic nuances and robustness to variability among reference answers.

Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive multilingual study showing LLM-based evaluators are superior for medical NLG evaluation. Highlights need for human-aligned evaluation methods in medical domain. Datasets will be publicly released.

Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems in the medical domain
presents unique challenges due to the critical demands for accuracy, relevance,
and domain-specific expertise. Traditional automatic evaluation metrics, such
as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, often fall short in distinguishing between
high-quality outputs, especially given the open-ended nature of medical
question answering (QA) tasks where multiple valid responses may exist. In this
work, we introduce MORQA (Medical Open-Response QA), a new multilingual
benchmark designed to assess the effectiveness of NLG evaluation metrics across
three medical visual and text-based QA datasets in English and Chinese. Unlike
prior resources, our datasets feature 2-4+ gold-standard answers authored by
medical professionals, along with expert human ratings for three English and
Chinese subsets. We benchmark both traditional metrics and large language model
(LLM)-based evaluators, such as GPT-4 and Gemini, finding that LLM-based
approaches significantly outperform traditional metrics in correlating with
expert judgments. We further analyze factors driving this improvement,
including LLMs' sensitivity to semantic nuances and robustness to variability
among reference answers. Our results provide the first comprehensive,
multilingual qualitative study of NLG evaluation in the medical domain,
highlighting the need for human-aligned evaluation methods. All datasets and
annotations will be publicly released to support future research.

*Jiayi He,Yangmin Huang,Qianyun Du,Xiangying Zhou,Zhiyang He,Jiaxue Hu,Xiaodong Tao,Lixian Lai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedFact is a new Chinese medical fact-checking benchmark with 2,116 expert-annotated instances across 13 specialties and 8 error types, revealing LLMs struggle with precise error localization and exhibit over-criticism tendencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are limited by narrow data domains and fail to capture real-world medical complexity, necessitating a more rigorous evaluation of LLMs' factual reliability in healthcare applications.

Method: Developed MedFact using a hybrid AI-human framework with iterative expert feedback to refine AI-driven multi-criteria filtering, creating diverse instances spanning 13 medical specialties, 8 error types, and 4 writing styles.

Result: Evaluation of 20 leading LLMs showed they can often detect errors but struggle with precise localization, falling short of human performance. Advanced reasoning techniques exacerbated 'over-criticism' where models misidentify correct information as erroneous.

Conclusion: MedFact highlights critical challenges for LLM deployment in medical applications and provides a robust resource to develop more factually reliable and medically aware models.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare
necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their factual reliability. However,
existing benchmarks are often limited by narrow domains of data, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world medical information. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MedFact, a new and challenging benchmark for Chinese
medical fact-checking. MedFact comprises 2,116 expert-annotated instances
curated from diverse real-world texts, spanning 13 medical specialties, 8
fine-grained error types, 4 writing styles, and multiple difficulty levels. Its
construction employs a hybrid AI-human framework where iterative expert
feedback refines an AI-driven, multi-criteria filtering process, ensuring both
high data quality and difficulty. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20
leading LLMs, benchmarking their performance on veracity classification and
error localization against a human expert baseline. Our results reveal that
while models can often determine if a text contains an error, precisely
localizing it remains a substantial challenge, with even top-performing models
falling short of human performance. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a
frequent ``over-criticism'' phenomenon, a tendency for models to misidentify
correct information as erroneous, which is exacerbated by advanced reasoning
techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and inference-time scaling. By
highlighting these critical challenges for deploying LLMs in medical
applications, MedFact provides a robust resource to drive the development of
more factually reliable and medically aware models.

### [116] [Topic Coverage-based Demonstration Retrieval for In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12451)
*Wonbin Kweon,SeongKu Kang,Runchu Tian,Pengcheng Jiang,Jiawei Han,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TopicK is a topic coverage-based retrieval framework that selects demonstrations to comprehensively cover topic-level knowledge relevant to both test inputs and the model's knowledge gaps, improving in-context learning effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for in-context learning demonstration selection rely on embedding similarity or generation probability, which often results in irrelevant or redundant examples that don't adequately cover the fine-grained knowledge requirements needed for effective learning.

Method: TopicK estimates topics required by the input, assesses the model's knowledge on those topics, and iteratively selects demonstrations that introduce previously uncovered required topics where the model exhibits low topical knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments across various datasets and both open- and closed-source LLMs validate the effectiveness of TopicK in improving in-context learning performance.

Conclusion: TopicK provides a more comprehensive and targeted approach to demonstration selection by focusing on topic coverage and model knowledge gaps, leading to more effective in-context learning compared to traditional similarity-based methods.

Abstract: The effectiveness of in-context learning relies heavily on selecting
demonstrations that provide all the necessary information for a given test
input. To achieve this, it is crucial to identify and cover fine-grained
knowledge requirements. However, prior methods often retrieve demonstrations
based solely on embedding similarity or generation probability, resulting in
irrelevant or redundant examples. In this paper, we propose TopicK, a topic
coverage-based retrieval framework that selects demonstrations to
comprehensively cover topic-level knowledge relevant to both the test input and
the model. Specifically, TopicK estimates the topics required by the input and
assesses the model's knowledge on those topics. TopicK then iteratively selects
demonstrations that introduce previously uncovered required topics, in which
the model exhibits low topical knowledge. We validate the effectiveness of
TopicK through extensive experiments across various datasets and both open- and
closed-source LLMs. Our source code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of SOTA language models on fine-grained linguistic phenomena (tense, negation, voice, modality) using new LUCID dataset and RECISE guidelines, with Compound-Beta emerging as the most balanced performer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMs struggle with fine-grained linguistic phenomena critical for educational applications under UN SDG 4, requiring scrutiny of their alignment with human linguistic interpretation for effective learning technologies.

Method: Introduced LUCID dataset with carefully crafted sentence pairs in English and Bengali, evaluated models using RECISE guidelines, standard metrics (Pearson/Spearman correlation, MAE), and novel HCE accuracy metric measuring human-like tolerance.

Result: Compound-Beta performed best as the most balanced model, achieving highest Pearson correlation in English and robust performance on mixed-language data, showing strong alignment with human judgments.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance of evaluating LMs on fine-grained linguistic phenomena, with Compound-Beta showing superior cross-lingual alignment with human interpretation, supporting better deployment in educational technologies.

Abstract: Despite advances in natural language generation and understanding, LM still
struggle with fine grained linguistic phenomena such as tense, negation, voice,
and modality which are the elements central to effective human communication.
In the context of the United Nations SDG 4, where linguistic clarity is
critical, the deployment of LMs in educational technologies demands careful
scrutiny. As LMs are increasingly powering applications like tutoring systems,
automated grading, and translation, their alignment with human linguistic
interpretation becomes essential for effective learning. In this study, we
conduct a evaluation of SOTA language models across these challenging contexts
in both English and Bengali. To ensure a structured assessment, we introduce a
new Route for Evaluation of Cognitive Inference in Systematic Environments
guidelines. Our proposed LUCID dataset, composed of carefully crafted sentence
pairs in English and Bengali, specifically challenges these models on critical
aspects of language comprehension, including negation, tense, voice variations.
We assess the performance of SOTA models including MISTRAL-SABA-24B,
LLaMA-4-Scout-17B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Gemma2-9B, and Compound-Beta using standard
metrics like Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and Mean Absolute
Error, as well as novel, linguistically inspired metric the HCE accuracy. The
HCE accuracy measures how often model predictions fall within one standard
deviation of the mean human rating, thus capturing human like tolerance for
variability in language interpretation. Our findings highlight Compound-Beta as
the most balanced model, consistently achieving high correlations and low MAEs
across diverse language conditions. It records the highest Pearson correlation
in English and demonstrates robust performance on mixed-language data,
indicating a strong alignment with human judgments in cross lingual scenarios.

TL;DR: R2tA is a method that uses refined LLM reasoning traces as supervision to train task-specific reasoning models when human labels are scarce, achieving effective adaptation through two-stage alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training task-specific reasoning models is challenging when direct human supervision or high-quality labels are limited, but LLMs produce abundant reasoning traces that can be refined into effective supervision signals.

Method: Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA) generates initial reasoning from base models, refines traces to fix hallucinations, and performs two-stage alignment (SFT followed by DPO) to calibrate intermediate reasoning with human preferences.

Result: Applied to evaluating EERD diagrams in database design, R2tA effectively handles structurally complex tasks where prompt-only methods fail, using a curated dataset of 600 EERD variants with induced mistakes.

Conclusion: R2tA provides a practical, cost-effective path for scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and specialized applications.

Abstract: Training a task-specific small reasoning model is challenging when direct
human supervision or high-quality labels are scarce. However, LLMs with
reasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can
be systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose
Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into
supervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates
initial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific
inputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies,
to form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to
calibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual
preferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a
case study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams
(EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where
prompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600
EERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes
spanning 11 categories. Empirical evaluation suggests R2tA provides a
practical, cost-effective path to scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce
domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in ASR systems are prone to hallucination, which degrades user experience in real-world applications. Most LLM-based ASR systems perform well on benchmarks but underperform on real industry evaluation sets.

Method: Combines massive data scaling, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement learning. Specifically optimized for practical deployment with streaming capability, noise robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and other real-world requirements.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on real application datasets, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness in practical settings while overcoming the hallucination problem common in LLM-based ASR systems.

Conclusion: FunAudio-ASR successfully addresses the practical deployment challenges of LLM-based ASR systems and shows superior performance in real-world scenarios compared to benchmark-focused approaches.

Abstract: In recent years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has witnessed
transformative advancements driven by three complementary paradigms: data
scaling, model size scaling, and deep integration with large language models
(LLMs). However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, which can significantly
degrade user experience in real-world ASR applications. In this paper, we
present FunAudio-ASR, a large-scale, LLM-based ASR system that synergistically
combines massive data, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement
learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse and complex
speech recognition scenarios. Moreover, FunAudio-ASR is specifically optimized
for practical deployment, with enhancements in streaming capability, noise
robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and satisfying other
real-world application requirements. Experimental results show that while most
LLM-based ASR systems achieve strong performance on open-source benchmarks,
they often underperform on real industry evaluation sets. Thanks to
production-oriented optimizations, FunAudio-ASR achieves SOTA performance on
real application datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in
practical settings.

*Chiara Bonfanti,Michele Colombino,Giulia Coucourde,Faeze Memari,Stefano Pinardi,Rosa Meo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comparison of three transformer-based pipelines for French-to-Bambara machine translation, showing simple transformer outperforms more complex approaches on low-resource language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop effective machine translation systems for Bambara, a low-resource African language spoken by over 14 million people, by comparing different neural network approaches.

Method: Three pipelines: 1) Simple transformer trained from scratch, 2) Fine-tuned LLaMA3 instructor models (3B-8B), 3) Language distillation with student-teacher network integrating Bambara into pre-trained LaBSE model with BERT extension.

Result: Simple transformer achieved best results: 10% BLEU and 21% chrF on Bayelemagaba, 33.81% BLEU and 41% chrF on Yiri dataset. Instructor models performed better on single datasets than aggregated collections.

Conclusion: Simpler transformer architecture outperforms more complex approaches for low-resource Bambara translation, consistent with findings in other low-resource language scenarios.

Abstract: This work compares three pipelines for training transformer-based neural
networks to produce machine translators for Bambara, a Mand\`e language spoken
in Africa by about 14,188,850 people. The first pipeline trains a simple
transformer to translate sentences from French into Bambara. The second
fine-tunes LLaMA3 (3B-8B) instructor models using decoder-only architectures
for French-to-Bambara translation. Models from the first two pipelines were
trained with different hyperparameter combinations to improve BLEU and chrF
scores, evaluated on both test sentences and official Bambara benchmarks. The
third pipeline uses language distillation with a student-teacher dual neural
network to integrate Bambara into a pre-trained LaBSE model, which provides
language-agnostic embeddings. A BERT extension is then applied to LaBSE to
generate translations. All pipelines were tested on Dokotoro (medical) and
Bayelemagaba (mixed domains). Results show that the first pipeline, although
simpler, achieves the best translation accuracy (10% BLEU, 21% chrF on
Bayelemagaba), consistent with low-resource translation results. On the Yiri
dataset, created for this work, it achieves 33.81% BLEU and 41% chrF.
Instructor-based models perform better on single datasets than on aggregated
collections, suggesting they capture dataset-specific patterns more
effectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Zero-shot AAC system using pre-trained audio CLIP and LLM achieves 35% improvement in caption quality without extensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated Audio Captioning faces data scarcity issues compared to image captioning, requiring solutions that don't need large training datasets.

Method: Uses pre-trained audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate structured prompts for LLM caption generation, with MAGIC search refinement instead of greedy decoding.

Result: 35% improvement in NLG mean score (4.7 to 7.3) using MAGIC search with WavCaps model. Performance depends on audio-text matching and keyword selection, with single keyword prompt working best.

Conclusion: Zero-shot approach with pre-trained models effectively addresses AAC data limitations, achieving significant performance gains through proper prompt engineering and audio-content alignment.

Abstract: Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) generates captions for audio clips but faces
challenges due to limited datasets compared to image captioning. To overcome
this, we propose the zero-shot AAC system that leverages pre-trained models,
eliminating the need for extensive training. Our approach uses a pre-trained
audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate a structured prompt,
which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in caption generation. Unlike
traditional greedy decoding, our method refines token selection through the
audio CLIP model, ensuring alignment with the audio content. Experimental
results demonstrate a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) using
MAGIC search with the WavCaps model. The performance is heavily influenced by
the audio-text matching model and keyword selection, with optimal results
achieved using a single keyword prompt, and a 50% performance drop when no
keyword list is used.

*Mukai Li,Linfeng Song,Zhenwen Liang,Jiahao Xu,Shansan Gong,Qi Liu,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EconProver reduces computational costs for automated theorem proving with LLMs by 88% while maintaining performance through dynamic CoT switching and diverse parallel-scaled RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling strategies for LLM-based theorem proving (reflective CoT and increased sampling passes) introduce significant computational overhead, but existing cost analyses neglect the substantial disparities in sampling costs from different scaling approaches.

Method: Proposes two complementary methods: (1) dynamic Chain-of-Thought switching mechanism to reduce unnecessary token consumption, and (2) diverse parallel-scaled reinforcement learning with trainable prefixes to enhance pass rates under constrained sampling passes. These are integrated into a unified EconRL pipeline.

Result: Experiments on miniF2F and ProofNet show EconProver achieves comparable performance to baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost.

Conclusion: Provides actionable insights for deploying lightweight automated theorem proving models without sacrificing performance, demonstrating significant efficiency improvements over current SOTA approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced the field of Automated
Theorem Proving (ATP), attaining substantial performance gains through widely
adopted test-time scaling strategies, notably reflective Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning and increased sampling passes. However, they both introduce
significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost
analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while
neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by
different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the
efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and
demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source
approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage
and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we
propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL
pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching
mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse
parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance
pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and
ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to
baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides
actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing
performance.

*Yu,Wang,Sheng Shen,Rémi Munos,Hongyuan Zhan,Yuandong Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoPE has distance-dependent bias that limits long-context modeling. TAPA introduces learnable phase attention to preserve long-range token interactions with better perplexity than RoPE methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE positional embeddings have intrinsic limitations in modeling long contexts due to distance-dependent bias, and existing extension methods require post-hoc adjustments after pretraining.

Method: Token-Aware Phase Attention (TAPA) incorporates a learnable phase function into the attention mechanism to improve long-range token interactions.

Result: TAPA achieves significantly lower perplexity on long-context tasks compared to RoPE families, extends to longer contexts with light fine-tuning, and extrapolates to unseen lengths.

Conclusion: TAPA provides a superior positional encoding method that overcomes RoPE's limitations for long-context modeling without requiring extensive post-training adjustments.

Abstract: We prove under practical assumptions that Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE)
introduces an intrinsic distance-dependent bias in attention scores that limits
RoPE's ability to model long-context. RoPE extension methods may alleviate this
issue, but they typically require post-hoc adjustments after pretraining, such
as rescaling or hyperparameters retuning. This paper introduces Token-Aware
Phase Attention (TAPA), a new positional encoding method that incorporates a
learnable phase function into the attention mechanism. TAPA preserves token
interactions over long range, extends to longer contexts with direct and light
fine-tuning, extrapolates to unseen lengths, and attains significantly lower
perplexity on long-context than RoPE families.

*Li Fu,Yu Xin,Sunlu Zeng,Lu Fan,Youzheng Wu,Xiaodong He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAC framework improves ASR by better modeling pronunciation and distinguishing homophones through two-stage learning with grapheme-phoneme context modeling and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in LLM-based ASR systems: effective pronunciation modeling and robust homophone discrimination for better raw/long-tail word recognition.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Pronunciation-guided context learning with interleaved grapheme-phoneme modeling and grapheme-only distractors, 2) Pronunciation-discriminative reinforcement learning with perturbed label sampling.

Result: 30.2% and 53.8% relative WER reduction on English Librispeech and Mandarin AISHELL-1 datasets; 31.8% and 60.5% relative reduction in biased WER for long-tail words.

Conclusion: PAC framework effectively enhances pronunciation awareness and homophone discrimination in ASR systems, significantly improving performance on both general and long-tail word recognition.

Abstract: This paper presents a Pronunciation-Aware Contextualized (PAC) framework to
address two key challenges in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems: effective pronunciation modeling and robust
homophone discrimination. Both are essential for raw or long-tail word
recognition. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage learning paradigm. First,
we introduce a pronunciation-guided context learning method. It employs an
interleaved grapheme-phoneme context modeling strategy that incorporates
grapheme-only distractors, encouraging the model to leverage phonemic cues for
accurate recognition. Then, we propose a pronunciation-discriminative
reinforcement learning method with perturbed label sampling to further enhance
the model\'s ability to distinguish contextualized homophones. Experimental
results on the public English Librispeech and Mandarin AISHELL-1 datasets
indicate that PAC: (1) reduces relative Word Error Rate (WER) by 30.2% and
53.8% compared to pre-trained LLM-based ASR models, and (2) achieves 31.8% and
60.5% relative reductions in biased WER for long-tail words compared to strong
baselines, respectively.

*Paul Kröger,Emilio Barkett*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for detecting ideological steering in large language models by analyzing distributional shifts in outputs across related prompts, suitable for auditing black-box systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs influence public opinion, there's a need to detect when they're intentionally steered toward specific ideological positions to prevent disproportionate control over public discourse.

Method: Adapts a statistical method for ideological bias auditing that analyzes distributional shifts in model outputs across thematically related prompts, without requiring access to model internals.

Result: The approach is validated through experiments, demonstrating practical applicability and potential for independent post hoc audits of LLM behavior.

Conclusion: Provides a crucial first step in detecting ideological steering attempts in LLMs, particularly valuable for auditing proprietary black-box systems where internal access is limited.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in products used
by millions, their outputs may influence individual beliefs and, cumulatively,
shape public opinion. If the behavior of LLMs can be intentionally steered
toward specific ideological positions, such as political or religious views,
then those who control these systems could gain disproportionate influence over
public discourse. Although it remains an open question whether LLMs can
reliably be guided toward coherent ideological stances and whether such
steering can be effectively prevented, a crucial first step is to develop
methods for detecting when such steering attempts occur. In this work, we adapt
a previously proposed statistical method to the new context of ideological bias
auditing. Our approach carries over the model-agnostic design of the original
framework, which does not require access to the internals of the language
model. Instead, it identifies potential ideological steering by analyzing
distributional shifts in model outputs across prompts that are thematically
related to a chosen topic. This design makes the method particularly suitable
for auditing proprietary black-box systems. We validate our approach through a
series of experiments, demonstrating its practical applicability and its
potential to support independent post hoc audits of LLM behavior.

*Yougen Zhou,Qin Chen,Ningning Zhou,Jie Zhou,Xingjiao Wu,Liang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses LLMs' preference bias in emotional support conversation strategy planning by identifying knowledge boundaries and using reinforcement learning with dual rewards to improve accuracy and reduce bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges in emotional support conversations due to low accuracy in strategy planning and significant preference bias towards specific strategies, with underlying causes not well studied.

Method: First identify knowledge boundaries of LLMs in strategy planning, then propose reinforcement learning approach with dual reward function that optimizes both accuracy and entropy-based confidence for different knowledge regions.

Result: Experiments on ESCov and ExTES datasets with multiple LLM backbones show the approach outperforms baselines, confirming effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully mitigates preference bias in LLM strategy planning for emotional support conversations by addressing knowledge boundaries through dual-reward reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate distress through
empathetic dialogue, yet large language models (LLMs) face persistent
challenges in delivering effective ESC due to low accuracy in strategy
planning. Moreover, there is a considerable preference bias towards specific
strategies. Prior methods using fine-tuned strategy planners have shown
potential in reducing such bias, while the underlying causes of the preference
bias in LLMs have not well been studied. To address these issues, we first
reveal the fundamental causes of the bias by identifying the knowledge
boundaries of LLMs in strategy planning. Then, we propose an approach to
mitigate the bias by reinforcement learning with a dual reward function, which
optimizes strategy planning via both accuracy and entropy-based confidence for
each region according to the knowledge boundaries. Experiments on the ESCov and
ExTES datasets with multiple LLM backbones show that our approach outperforms
the baselines, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

*Zequn Xie,Chuxin Wang,Sihang Cai,Yeqiang Wang,Shulei Wang,Tao Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel annotation-free framework for text-based person search using multi-turn text generation and interaction modules to eliminate manual caption requirements while improving retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based person search requires labor-intensive manual annotations, limiting scalability and practical deployment. The paper aims to address this by creating an annotation-free system that can handle vague real-world descriptions.

Method: Two complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) uses MLLMs to generate rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues, and Multi-Turn Text Interaction (MTI) refines user queries at inference time through dynamic dialogue-based reasoning.

Result: Extensive evaluations show competitive or superior results compared to methods requiring manual captions, significantly improving retrieval accuracy, robustness, and usability.

Conclusion: The unified annotation-free framework enables scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems by eliminating manual caption requirements while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Text-based person search (TBPS) enables the retrieval of person images from
large-scale databases using natural language descriptions, offering critical
value in surveillance applications. However, a major challenge lies in the
labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations, which
limits scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we introduce two
complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) and Multi-Turn Text
Interaction (MTI). MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues
with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without
manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic,
dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague,
incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in
real-world search scenarios. Together, MTG and MTI form a unified and
annotation-free framework that significantly improves retrieval accuracy,
robustness, and usability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive or superior results while eliminating the need for manual
captions, paving the way for scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems.

*Shaz Furniturewala,Arkaitz Zubiaga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes using mechanistic interpretability to identify and suppress vulnerable circuits in toxicity classifiers, improving robustness against adversarial attacks on LLM-generated content while revealing demographic-specific vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-generated content challenges traditional toxicity classifiers trained on human text, causing misclassifications from distribution shifts and adversarial attacks. Current defenses are reactive rather than proactive.

Method: Uses mechanistic interpretability on fine-tuned BERT/RoBERTa classifiers, identifies vulnerable circuits via adversarial attacks, and suppresses these circuits to improve robustness. Tests on diverse datasets covering minority groups.

Result: Found distinct heads crucial for performance vs vulnerable to attack. Suppressing vulnerable heads improves adversarial performance. Different heads responsible for vulnerabilities across demographic groups.

Conclusion: Approach enhances toxicity classifier robustness and reveals fairness gaps, providing insights for more inclusive model development by understanding demographic-specific vulnerabilities.

Abstract: The volume of machine-generated content online has grown dramatically due to
the widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to new challenges
for content moderation systems. Conventional content moderation classifiers,
which are usually trained on text produced by humans, suffer from
misclassifications due to LLM-generated text deviating from their training data
and adversarial attacks that aim to avoid detection. Present-day defence
tactics are reactive rather than proactive, since they rely on adversarial
training or external detection models to identify attacks. In this work, we aim
to identify the vulnerable components of toxicity classifiers that contribute
to misclassification, proposing a novel strategy based on mechanistic
interpretability techniques. Our study focuses on fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa
classifiers, testing on diverse datasets spanning a variety of minority groups.
We use adversarial attacking techniques to identify vulnerable circuits.
Finally, we suppress these vulnerable circuits, improving performance against
adversarial attacks. We also provide demographic-level insights into these
vulnerable circuits, exposing fairness and robustness gaps in model training.
We find that models have distinct heads that are either crucial for performance
or vulnerable to attack and suppressing the vulnerable heads improves
performance on adversarial input. We also find that different heads are
responsible for vulnerability across different demographic groups, which can
inform more inclusive development of toxicity detection models.

*Hiroyuki Deguchi,Masaaki Nagata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CBDT decoding combines case-based reasoning with decision theory to improve text generation quality, outperforming both MAP and MBR decoding methods across multiple translation and captioning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBR decoding depends on sample texts from the model, making it difficult to capture knowledge from out-of-domain data. The authors aim to address this limitation by incorporating domain-specific examples.

Method: Proposed case-based decision-theoretic (CBDT) decoding, which estimates expected utility using examples of domain data rather than relying solely on model-generated samples.

Result: CBDT decoding generated higher-quality texts than MAP decoding. The combination of MBR and CBDT decoding outperformed MBR alone in seven domain translation tasks (De-En and Ja-En) and image captioning tasks on MSCOCO and nocaps datasets.

Conclusion: CBDT decoding provides an effective alternative to MBR decoding that better handles out-of-domain knowledge by leveraging domain-specific examples, demonstrating improved performance across multiple text generation tasks.

Abstract: Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding is a decision rule of text generation,
which selects the hypothesis that maximizes the expected utility and robustly
generates higher-quality texts than maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding.
However, it depends on sample texts drawn from the text generation model; thus,
it is difficult to find a hypothesis that correctly captures the knowledge or
information of out-of-domain. To tackle this issue, we propose case-based
decision-theoretic (CBDT) decoding, another method to estimate the expected
utility using examples of domain data. CBDT decoding not only generates
higher-quality texts than MAP decoding, but also the combination of MBR and
CBDT decoding outperformed MBR decoding in seven domain De--En and
Ja$\leftrightarrow$En translation tasks and image captioning tasks on MSCOCO
and nocaps datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HistoryBank is a multilingual database of 10M+ historical events from Wikipedia, with a comprehensive QA benchmark for temporal reasoning across 6 tasks and 10 languages, showing GPT4o performs best while Gemma-2 leads among smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing temporal reasoning datasets are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage, and focus more on contemporary events, creating a need for better benchmarking of LLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities.

Method: Extracted 10M+ historical events from Wikipedia timeline pages and article infoboxes across 10 languages, then constructed a comprehensive question answering benchmark covering 6 temporal reasoning tasks.

Result: GPT4o performed best across all answer types and languages; Gemma-2-9B outperformed other small language models (LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, Qwen3-8B) on temporal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: HistoryBank provides unprecedented multilingual historical event coverage and serves as a comprehensive resource for advancing temporally-aware natural language understanding, with code and datasets to be made publicly available.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning about historical events is a critical skill for NLP tasks
like event extraction, historical entity linking, temporal question answering,
timeline summarization, temporal event clustering and temporal natural language
inference. Yet efforts on benchmarking temporal reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) are rather limited. Existing temporal reasoning datasets
are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage and focus more on contemporary
events. To address these limitations, we present HistoryBank, a multilingual
database of 10M+ historical events extracted from Wikipedia timeline pages and
article infoboxes. Our database provides unprecedented coverage in both
historical depth and linguistic breadth with 10 languages. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive question answering benchmark for temporal reasoning
across all languages. This benchmark covers a diverse set of 6 temporal QA
reasoning tasks, and we evaluate a suite of popular language models
(LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9b, Qwen3-8B, GPT4o) to assess their
performance on these tasks. As expected GPT4o performs best across all answer
types and languages; Gemma-2 outperforms the other small language models. Our
work aims to provide a comprehensive resource for advancing multilingual and
temporally-aware natural language understanding of historical events. To
facilitate further research, we will make our code and datasets publicly
available upon acceptance of this paper.

*Omri Suissa,Muhiim Ali,Shengmai Chen,Yinuo Cai,Shekhar Pradhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR GLASS model uses grouped contrastive learning with MAGIC dataset to enable VLMs to recognize abstract concepts beyond object identification, achieving improved concept abstraction capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can recognize images as instances of general concepts beyond object relationships, but current VLMs lack this concept abstraction capability. The paper aims to investigate and enhance this capacity in VLMs.

Method: Introduced MAGIC dataset with grouped image-caption pairs and higher-level conceptual labels. Used novel contrastive loss with outer contrastive loss between text-image groups and inner loss measuring distances within groups. Training forces model to create semantic representations that align with higher-level concepts.

Result: The CLEAR GLASS model demonstrates improved abstract concept recognition compared to state-of-the-art models, with concept abstraction emerging as a capability without direct exposure to higher-level concepts during training.

Conclusion: Grouped contrastive learning enables VLMs to develop concept abstraction capacity by encoding common information across image-caption groups, resulting in emergent higher-level concept recognition capabilities.

Abstract: Humans can recognize an image as an instance of a general concept, beyond
simply identifying its objects and their relationships. In this paper, we
investigate 1. The extent to which VLMs have this concept abstraction capacity,
and 2. Strategies for encoding the sort of higher-concept information in images
that would enable the resulting VLM model (CLEAR GLASS model) to have this
capability to a greater degree. To this end, we introduce a grouped
image-caption dataset (MAGIC), which consists of several groups of image
captions and for each group a set of associated images and higher-level
conceptual labels. We use a novel contrastive loss technique to induce the
model to encode in the representation of each image (caption) in a group the
information that is common to all members of the image-caption group. Our main
contribution is a grouped contrastive loss function based on text-image
contrastive groups (outer contrastive loss) as well as an inner loss which
measures the distances between image-caption instances in the group. Our
training methodology results in the CLEAR GLASS model having the concept
abstraction capacity as an emergent capacity because the model is not exposed
to the higher-level concepts associated with each group. Instead, the training
forces the model to create for each image-caption group a semantic
representation that brings it closer to the semantic representation of the
higher-level concepts in the latent semantic space. Our experiments show that
this training methodology results in a model which shows improvement in
abstract concept recognition compared to SOTA models.

TL;DR: A bottom-up framework that first retrieves and clusters knowledge before generating documents, reducing hallucinations and improving factual accuracy in long-form text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing top-down methods for long-form document generation often create disconnects between generated outlines and available knowledge, leading to factual inaccuracies and fragmented content.

Method: Retrieval-First for Knowledge, Clustering for Structure approach: exhaustive iterative retrieval from knowledge base followed by unsupervised clustering to organize documents into knowledge clusters, which then guide hierarchical outline and document generation.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art baselines on both 14B and 32B parameter models, with particular advantages in knowledge-constrained scenarios requiring high fidelity and structural coherence.

Conclusion: Presents an effective paradigm for generating reliable, structured long-form documents that are strictly constrained by source material, paving the way for robust LLM applications in high-stakes, knowledge-intensive domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable prowess in text
generation, yet producing long-form, factual documents grounded in extensive
external knowledge bases remains a significant challenge. Existing "top-down"
methods, which first generate a hypothesis or outline and then retrieve
evidence, often suffer from a disconnect between the model's plan and the
available knowledge, leading to content fragmentation and factual inaccuracies.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel "bottom-up," data-driven
framework that inverts the conventional generation pipeline. Our approach is
predicated on a "Retrieval-First for Knowledge, Clustering for Structure"
strategy, which first establishes the "knowledge boundaries" of the source
corpus before any generative planning occurs. Specifically, we perform
exhaustive iterative retrieval from the knowledge base and then employ an
unsupervised clustering algorithm to organize the retrieved documents into
distinct "knowledge clusters." These clusters form an objective, data-driven
foundation that directly guides the subsequent generation of a hierarchical
outline and the final document content. This bottom-up process ensures that the
generated text is strictly constrained by and fully traceable to the source
material, proactively adapting to the finite scope of the knowledge base and
fundamentally mitigating the risk of hallucination. Experimental results on
both 14B and 32B parameter models demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art baselines, and is
expected to demonstrate unique advantages in knowledge-constrained scenarios
that demand high fidelity and structural coherence. Our work presents an
effective paradigm for generating reliable, structured, long-form documents,
paving the way for more robust LLM applications in high-stakes,
knowledge-intensive domains.

TL;DR: Arabic-language resources can support Maltese NLP through cross-lingual augmentation using transliteration and machine translation techniques, with novel transliteration systems showing significant benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maltese is a unique Semitic language with Latin script orthography that creates a gap from its Arabic linguistic relatives, making it challenging for NLP despite shared roots.

Method: Investigated multiple strategies including various transliteration schemes, novel transliteration systems for Maltese orthography, and machine translation approaches to align Arabic textual data with Maltese.

Result: Arabic-based augmentation significantly benefits Maltese NLP tasks, as demonstrated through evaluation on monolingual and multilingual models.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual augmentation techniques using Arabic resources are effective for Maltese NLP, with novel transliteration systems providing better representation of Maltese orthography.

Abstract: Maltese is a unique Semitic language that has evolved under extensive
influence from Romance and Germanic languages, particularly Italian and
English. Despite its Semitic roots, its orthography is based on the Latin
script, creating a gap between it and its closest linguistic relatives in
Arabic. In this paper, we explore whether Arabic-language resources can support
Maltese natural language processing (NLP) through cross-lingual augmentation
techniques. We investigate multiple strategies for aligning Arabic textual data
with Maltese, including various transliteration schemes and machine translation
(MT) approaches. As part of this, we also introduce novel transliteration
systems that better represent Maltese orthography. We evaluate the impact of
these augmentations on monolingual and mutlilingual models and demonstrate that
Arabic-based augmentation can significantly benefit Maltese NLP tasks.

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on Multimedia Event Extraction (M2E2) tasks, showing few-shot LVLMs excel at visual tasks but struggle with text, while fine-tuning with LoRA significantly improves performance and cross-modal synergy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of multimedia content requires effective M2E2 systems, but LVLMs' utility for M2E2 tasks remains underexplored despite their strong cross-modal capabilities.

Method: Evaluated representative LVLMs (DeepSeek-VL2, Qwen-VL series) on M2E2 dataset across text-only, image-only, and cross-media subtasks under few-shot prompting and fine-tuning settings.

Result: Few-shot LVLMs perform better on visual tasks but struggle with textual tasks; fine-tuning with LoRA substantially enhances performance; LVLMs show strong synergy in cross-modal settings achieving superior performance.

Conclusion: Detailed error analysis reveals persistent challenges in semantic precision, localization, and cross-modal grounding that remain critical obstacles for advancing M2E2 capabilities.

Abstract: The proliferation of multimedia content necessitates the development of
effective Multimedia Event Extraction (M2E2) systems. Though Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong cross-modal capabilities,
their utility in the M2E2 task remains underexplored. In this paper, we present
the first systematic evaluation of representative LVLMs, including DeepSeek-VL2
and the Qwen-VL series, on the M2E2 dataset. Our evaluations cover text-only,
image-only, and cross-media subtasks, assessed under both few-shot prompting
and fine-tuning settings. Our key findings highlight the following valuable
insights: (1) Few-shot LVLMs perform notably better on visual tasks but
struggle significantly with textual tasks; (2) Fine-tuning LVLMs with LoRA
substantially enhances model performance; and (3) LVLMs exhibit strong synergy
when combining modalities, achieving superior performance in cross-modal
settings. We further provide a detailed error analysis to reveal persistent
challenges in areas such as semantic precision, localization, and cross-modal
grounding, which remain critical obstacles for advancing M2E2 capabilities.

*Yubo Zhu,Dongrui Liu,Zecheng Lin,Wei Tong,Sheng Zhong,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel method for estimating question difficulty for LLMs using only hidden representations, without generating output tokens, achieving better performance and efficiency than existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing difficulty estimation methods for LLMs require repeated sampling, auxiliary models, or fine-tuning, which are computationally expensive and lack generality.

Method: Model token-level generation as a Markov chain and define a value function to estimate expected output quality from hidden states, enabling difficulty estimation without generating tokens.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines in difficulty estimation across textual and multimodal tasks, and enables more efficient adaptive reasoning strategies with fewer generated tokens.

Conclusion: The proposed hidden representation-based approach provides accurate and efficient difficulty estimation for LLMs without computational overhead of token generation, improving inference efficiency.

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of input questions as perceived by large language
models (LLMs) is essential for accurate performance evaluation and adaptive
inference. Existing methods typically rely on repeated response sampling,
auxiliary models, or fine-tuning the target model itself, which may incur
substantial computational costs or compromise generality. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for difficulty estimation that leverages only the
hidden representations produced by the target LLM. We model the token-level
generation process as a Markov chain and define a value function to estimate
the expected output quality given any hidden state. This allows for efficient
and accurate difficulty estimation based solely on the initial hidden state,
without generating any output tokens. Extensive experiments across both textual
and multimodal tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing baselines in difficulty estimation. Moreover, we apply our difficulty
estimates to guide adaptive reasoning strategies, including Self-Consistency,
Best-of-N, and Self-Refine, achieving higher inference efficiency with fewer
generated tokens.

TL;DR: Conan-embedding-v2 is a 1.4B parameter LLM trained from scratch as a text embedder, achieving SOTA performance on MTEB benchmarks by addressing data and training gaps through cross-lingual retrieval data and soft-masking techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous LLM fine-tuning approaches using LoRA are limited by data and training gaps between language models and embedding models, necessitating a specialized solution for text embedding tasks.

Method: Trained a 1.4B parameter LLM from scratch with added news data and multilingual pairs, introduced cross-lingual retrieval dataset, implemented soft-masking mechanism to transition between causal and bidirectional masks, and used dynamic hard negative mining.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on both Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese MTEB as of May 19, 2025, with only 1.4B parameters.

Conclusion: Training LLMs from scratch specifically for embedding tasks with appropriate data and training techniques can overcome limitations of fine-tuning approaches and deliver superior performance in text embedding benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated excellent performance
in text embedding tasks. Previous work usually use LoRA to fine-tune existing
LLMs, which are limited by the data and training gap between LLMs and embedding
models. In this work, we introduce Conan-embedding-v2, a new 1.4B-parameter LLM
trained from scratch and fine-tuned as a text embedder. First, we add news data
and multilingual pairs for LLM pretraining to bridge the data gap. Based on
this, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to
better integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs
use a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional
mask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less
effective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually
transition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more
comprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard
negative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative
examples throughout the training process. Being intuitive and effective, with
only approximately 1.4B parameters, Conan-embedding-v2 achieves SOTA
performance on both the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese
MTEB (May 19, 2025).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing confidence estimation methods for LLMs are designed for factual QA tasks and fail to generalize to reasoning tasks, creating a reliability gap in deployment.

Method: Model reasoning paths as directed graphs and estimate confidence using graph properties like centrality, path convergence, and path weighting without requiring training.

Result: Experiments with two LLMs on three reasoning datasets show improved confidence estimation and enhanced performance on two downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Graph-based approaches provide effective training-free confidence estimation for LLMs in reasoning tasks, addressing the generalization gap from factual QA methods.

Abstract: Confidence estimation is essential for the reliable deployment of large
language models (LLMs). Existing methods are primarily designed for factual QA
tasks and often fail to generalize to reasoning tasks. To address this gap, we
propose a set of training-free, graph-based confidence estimation methods
tailored to reasoning tasks. Our approach models reasoning paths as directed
graphs and estimates confidence by exploiting graph properties such as
centrality, path convergence, and path weighting. Experiments with two LLMs on
three reasoning datasets demonstrate improved confidence estimation and
enhanced performance on two downstream tasks.

*Heng Zhang,Chengzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: End-to-end framework for generating comprehensive research workflows from academic papers using PU learning, Flan-T5, and ChatGPT to identify workflow paragraphs, extract phrases, categorize stages, and create visual flowcharts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated generation of research workflows is essential for improving reproducibility and accelerating AI for Science, but existing methods only extract fragmented components rather than complete workflows.

Method: Paragraph-centric approach using PU Learning with SciBERT to identify workflow paragraphs, Flan-T5 for phrase generation, ChatGPT for stage categorization (data preparation, processing, analysis), and mapping to create visual flowcharts.

Result: Achieved F1-score of 0.9772 for paragraph identification, ROUGE scores of 0.4543/0.2877/0.4427 for phrase generation, and 0.958 precision for stage classification. Successfully analyzed NLP workflows and revealed methodological shifts over two decades.

Conclusion: Provides validated technical framework for automated workflow generation and offers process-oriented perspective for investigating evolving scientific paradigms, with available source code and data.

Abstract: The automated generation of research workflows is essential for improving the
reproducibility of research and accelerating the paradigm of "AI for Science".
However, existing methods typically extract merely fragmented procedural
components and thus fail to capture complete research workflows. To address
this gap, we propose an end-to-end framework that generates comprehensive,
structured research workflows by mining full-text academic papers. As a case
study in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, our paragraph-centric
approach first employs Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning with SciBERT to
identify workflow-descriptive paragraphs, achieving an F1-score of 0.9772.
Subsequently, we utilize Flan-T5 with prompt learning to generate workflow
phrases from these paragraphs, yielding ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of
0.4543, 0.2877, and 0.4427, respectively. These phrases are then systematically
categorized into data preparation, data processing, and data analysis stages
using ChatGPT with few-shot learning, achieving a classification precision of
0.958. By mapping categorized phrases to their document locations in the
documents, we finally generate readable visual flowcharts of the entire
research workflows. This approach facilitates the analysis of workflows derived
from an NLP corpus and reveals key methodological shifts over the past two
decades, including the increasing emphasis on data analysis and the transition
from feature engineering to ablation studies. Our work offers a validated
technical framework for automated workflow generation, along with a novel,
process-oriented perspective for the empirical investigation of evolving
scientific paradigms. Source code and data are available at:

*Yuval Weiss,David Demitri Africa,Paula Buttery,Richard Diehl Martinez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReLoRA underperforms standard training for small language models (11M-66M parameters) in pretraining, with performance gaps widening for larger models and reinforcing rank deficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate ReLoRA's effectiveness for small language model pretraining, given the computational and environmental benefits of SLMs compared to larger models.

Method: Conducted ablation experiments on SLMs (11M-66M parameters) comparing ReLoRA against standard training, evaluating performance on loss, Paloma perplexity, and BLiMP benchmarks, and analyzing learning dynamics.

Result: ReLoRA generally performed worse than standard training across all metrics, with performance gaps increasing for larger models. Analysis revealed ReLoRA reinforces rank deficiencies in smaller models.

Conclusion: Low-rank update strategies like ReLoRA may not transfer well to SLM pretraining, indicating need for more research in low-compute training regimes.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA have revolutionised the fine-tuning
of LLMs. Still, their extension to pretraining via ReLoRA is less well
understood, especially for small language models (SLMs), which offer lower
computational and environmental costs. This work is the first systematic study
of ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters), evaluating both performance and
learning dynamics. Through ablation experiments, we find that ReLoRA generally
performs worse than standard training on loss, Paloma perplexity and BLiMP,
with the gap widening for the larger models. Further analysis of the learning
dynamics of the models indicates that ReLoRA reinforces the rank deficiencies
found in smaller models. These results indicate that low-rank update strategies
may not transfer easily to SLM pretraining, highlighting the need for more
research in the low-compute regime.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces cross-cultural wine review adaptation, creating a parallel corpus and showing current models struggle with cultural nuances in translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adapting wine reviews across Chinese and English cultures, going beyond literal translation to incorporate regional taste preferences and culture-specific flavor descriptors.

Method: Compiled a parallel corpus of 8k Chinese and 16k Anglophone wine reviews, benchmarked neural machine translation and LLMs using automatic metrics and human evaluation with three culture-oriented criteria.

Result: Current models struggle to capture cultural nuances, particularly in translating wine descriptions across different cultures, revealing limitations in handling cultural content.

Conclusion: The study highlights significant challenges in cross-cultural adaptation and the need for improved models that can better handle cultural nuances in translation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to
culture-aware language tasks. We introduce the novel problem of adapting wine
reviews across Chinese and English, which goes beyond literal translation by
incorporating regional taste preferences and culture-specific flavor
descriptors. In a case study on cross-cultural wine review adaptation, we
compile the first parallel corpus of professional reviews, containing 8k
Chinese and 16k Anglophone reviews. We benchmark both
neural-machine-translation baselines and state-of-the-art LLMs with automatic
metrics and human evaluation. For the latter, we propose three culture-oriented
criteria -- Cultural Proximity, Cultural Neutrality, and Cultural Genuineness
-- to assess how naturally a translated review resonates with target-culture
readers. Our analysis shows that current models struggle to capture cultural
nuances, especially in translating wine descriptions across different cultures.
This highlights the challenges and limitations of translation models in
handling cultural content.

*Jian Gao,Fufangchen Zhao,Yiyang Zhang,Danfeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SitLLM is a lightweight multimodal framework that combines pressure sensing with large language models for fine-grained sitting posture monitoring and personalized health feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sitting posture monitoring systems suffer from coarse-grained recognition and lack semantic expressiveness needed for personalized feedback, despite using various sensing modalities.

Method: Three key components: 1) Gaussian-Robust Sensor Embedding Module for robust feature extraction from pressure maps, 2) Prompt-Driven Cross-Modal Alignment Module to reprogram sensor embeddings into LLM's semantic space, 3) Multi-Context Prompt Module that fuses multiple contextual information types for instruction comprehension.

Result: The paper proposes a framework that enables fine-grained posture understanding and personalized health-oriented response generation, though specific quantitative results are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: SitLLM represents an innovative approach to sitting posture monitoring by integrating flexible pressure sensing with large language models, addressing limitations of existing systems through multimodal fusion and semantic alignment.

Abstract: Poor sitting posture is a critical yet often overlooked factor contributing
to long-term musculoskeletal disorders and physiological dysfunctions. Existing
sitting posture monitoring systems, although leveraging visual, IMU, or
pressure-based modalities, often suffer from coarse-grained recognition and
lack the semantic expressiveness necessary for personalized feedback. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SitLLM}, a lightweight multimodal framework that
integrates flexible pressure sensing with large language models (LLMs) to
enable fine-grained posture understanding and personalized health-oriented
response generation. SitLLM comprises three key components: (1) a
\textit{Gaussian-Robust Sensor Embedding Module} that partitions pressure maps
into spatial patches and injects local noise perturbations for robust feature
extraction; (2) a \textit{Prompt-Driven Cross-Modal Alignment Module} that
reprograms sensor embeddings into the LLM's semantic space via multi-head
cross-attention using the pre-trained vocabulary embeddings; and (3) a
\textit{Multi-Context Prompt Module} that fuses feature-level, structure-level,
statistical-level, and semantic-level contextual information to guide
instruction comprehension.

*Nolan Platt,Pragyansmita Nayak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs used as teachers to generate synthetic maritime Q&A data, enabling 261x cost reduction while achieving 75% accuracy with fine-tuned smaller models instead of expensive larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized fields like maritime intelligence face data scarcity and complexity, making direct LLM inference expensive and impractical for domain-specific applications.

Method: Transform 3.2B AIS vessel records into 21,543 synthetic Q&A pairs using GPT-4o and o3-mini, then fine-tune Qwen2.5-7B model on this synthetic data.

Result: Achieved 75% accuracy on maritime tasks with substantial cost reduction (261x cheaper) compared to using larger models directly for inference.

Conclusion: Smaller models fine-tuned on synthetic data can match larger model performance at dramatically lower costs, providing reproducible framework for domains with manual annotation challenges.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
many domains, yet their application to specialized fields remains constrained
by the scarcity and complexity of domain-specific training data. We present a
novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by
using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference.
Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel
tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through
multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing overfitting and
ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves
75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a
larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models -- when fine
tuned properly -- can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that
are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of
synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a
highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is
infeasible. Beyond expanding research in the growing field of specialized small
language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety,
security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various
industries.

*Francesco Pappone,Ruggero Marino Lazzaroni,Federico Califano,Niccolò Gentile,Roberto Marras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using a small encoder transformer as semantic reward model within GRPO framework improves LLM-generated explanations' faithfulness and clarity in medical exam contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to align outputs with complex qualitative goals like pedagogical soundness. Standard RL techniques rely on slow LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or brittle keyword metrics like ROUGE that fail to capture semantic quality.

Method: Introduce small efficient encoder-only transformer as semantic reward model within GRPO framework. Provides dense reward signal based on cosine similarity between generated explanation and ground-truth reference, guiding policy toward structurally and conceptually aligned explanations.

Result: GRPO with semantic reward significantly improves explanation faithfulness and clarity over strong SFT baseline in Italian medical-school entrance exam training task.

Conclusion: Lightweight encoder models are powerful for nuanced reward shaping in complex generation tasks, enabling better alignment with semantic quality goals beyond factual correctness.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like text,
aligning their outputs with complex, qualitative goals like pedagogical
soundness remains a significant challenge. Standard reinforcement learning
techniques often rely on slow and expensive LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or on
brittle, keyword-based metrics like ROUGE, which fail to capture the semantic
essence of a high-quality explanation. In this work, we introduce a novel
approach to reward shaping within the Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO)
framework. Our central contribution is the use of a small, efficient
encoder-only transformer as a semantic reward model. This model provides a
dense, semantically rich reward signal based on the cosine similarity between a
generated explanation and a ground-truth reference, guiding the policy towards
explanations that are not just factually correct but also structurally and
conceptually aligned with expert reasoning. We apply this method to the task of
training a model for the Italian medical-school entrance examinations,
following standard domain-adaptive continued pre-training (CPT) and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Our results demonstrate that GRPO with our proposed semantic
reward significantly improves explanation faithfulness and clarity over a
strong SFT baseline, showcasing the power of using lightweight encoder models
for nuanced reward shaping in complex generation tasks

*Sijia Cui,Shuai Xu,Aiyao He,Yanna Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLAP framework combines LLM planning with parameterized skills to improve agent grounding in long-horizon environments, outperforming baselines in MicroRTS game.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agents struggle with reliable low-level action generation and require expert experience for high-level task translation in complex environments.

Method: PLAP framework with three components: skill library (parameterized skills), LLM-powered skill planner, and skill executor that converts parameterized skills to executable actions.

Result: GPT-4o-driven PLAP outperformed 80% of baseline agents in zero-shot setting; Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP with few-shot examples surpassed top-tier scripted agent CoacAI.

Conclusion: PLAP effectively grounds LLM-based agents in long-horizon environments and provides a framework for evaluating LLM skill planning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have led to the
development of LLM-based AI agents. A key challenge is the creation of agents
that can effectively ground themselves in complex, adversarial long-horizon
environments. Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to
interact with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions,
and (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to
stimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable
actions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate
high-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges,
we introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning
framework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon
environments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill
library containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill
planner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized
skills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a
long-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and
challenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of PLAP. In particular, GPT-4o-driven PLAP in a zero-shot setting
outperforms 80% of baseline agents, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP, with carefully
crafted few-shot examples, surpasses the top-tier scripted agent, CoacAI.
Additionally, we design comprehensive evaluation metrics and test 6
closed-source and 2 open-source LLMs within the PLAP framework, ultimately
releasing an LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability. Our
code is available at https://github.com/AI-Research-TeamX/PLAP.

*Jinxin Li,Gang Tu,ShengYu Cheng,Junjie Hu,Jinting Wang,Rui Chen,Zhilong Zhou,Dongbo Shan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HSAD is a novel hallucination detection framework that analyzes temporal dynamics of hidden representations during LLM generation using frequency-domain analysis, achieving significant improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination detection methods have limitations - factuality checking is constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis fails to capture reasoning dynamics, leading to limited effectiveness and robustness.

Method: HSAD models temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive generation by constructing hidden-layer signals, applying FFT for frequency-domain analysis, extracting strongest non-DC frequency components as spectral features, and identifying optimal observation points.

Result: Across multiple benchmarks including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over 10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: HSAD establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection by integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, providing a more effective solution for reliability-sensitive LLM applications.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models
(LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods
largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally
constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis,
that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their
effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal
Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that
models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive
generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across
layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain
representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as
spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of
LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable
detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over
10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By
integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD
establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.

### [146] [The Few-shot Dilemma: Over-prompting Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13196)
*Yongjian Tang,Doruk Tuncel,Christian Koerner,Thomas Runkler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Over-prompting degrades LLM performance when too many examples are used. The study identifies optimal few-shot example quantities for different LLMs using TF-IDF selection and achieves state-of-the-art requirement classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the over-prompting phenomenon where excessive examples in prompts paradoxically diminish LLM performance, challenging conventional few-shot learning wisdom.

Method: Used three few-shot selection methods (random sampling, semantic embedding, TF-IDF vectors) across multiple LLMs. Gradually increased TF-IDF-selected stratified examples to find optimal quantities for each model on software requirement datasets.

Result: Excessive domain-specific examples degrade performance in certain LLMs. The combined TF-IDF and stratified approach achieved superior performance with fewer examples, surpassing state-of-the-art by 1% in requirement classification.

Conclusion: Optimal few-shot example quantity varies by LLM. Strategic selection with TF-IDF and stratification avoids over-prompting and improves performance, contradicting the assumption that more relevant examples always benefit LLMs.

Abstract: Over-prompting, a phenomenon where excessive examples in prompts lead to
diminished performance in Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges the
conventional wisdom about in-context few-shot learning. To investigate this
few-shot dilemma, we outline a prompting framework that leverages three
standard few-shot selection methods - random sampling, semantic embedding, and
TF-IDF vectors - and evaluate these methods across multiple LLMs, including
GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, DeepSeek-V3, Gemma-3, LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.2, and Mistral.
Our experimental results reveal that incorporating excessive domain-specific
examples into prompts can paradoxically degrade performance in certain LLMs,
which contradicts the prior empirical conclusion that more relevant few-shot
examples universally benefit LLMs. Given the trend of LLM-assisted software
engineering and requirement analysis, we experiment with two real-world
software requirement classification datasets. By gradually increasing the
number of TF-IDF-selected and stratified few-shot examples, we identify their
optimal quantity for each LLM. This combined approach achieves superior
performance with fewer examples, avoiding the over-prompting problem, thus
surpassing the state-of-the-art by 1% in classifying functional and
non-functional requirements.

*Jianfeng Zhu,Julina Maharjan,Xinyu Li,Karin G. Coifman,Ruoming Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show limited ability to accurately infer human personality traits from conversations, with all correlations below 0.26 despite various methods including prompting, fine-tuning, and embedding-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in psychological roles like emotional support and counseling, their ability to understand human personality traits from natural conversations remains unexplored and needs validation against ground-truth assessments.

Method: Created a benchmark with interview transcripts and validated Big Five trait scores. Evaluated three approaches: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA fine-tuning of RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA, (3) regression using BERT and OpenAI text embeddings.

Result: All Pearson correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits remained below 0.26. Chain-of-thought provided minimal improvement over zero-shot, indicating personality inference relies more on latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limited alignment with validated psychological constructs, highlighting challenges in modeling complex human attributes. Future work should focus on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and alignment-oriented fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring
nuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents,
counselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret
human personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains
unexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While
prior work has simulated LLM "personas" using discrete Big Five labels on
social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth
personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely
unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising
semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five
trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance
across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with
GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA
architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT
and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson
correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits
remain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with
validated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal
gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on
latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings
underscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and
motivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and
alignment-oriented fine-tuning.

TL;DR: ChartGaze is an eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during chart reasoning. The paper shows LVLMs often diverge from human attention patterns, and proposes gaze-guided attention refinement to improve accuracy and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models struggle with chart question answering, often attending to irrelevant chart regions. Human gaze patterns during chart reasoning could provide valuable guidance to improve model attention and performance.

Method: Created ChartGaze eye-tracking dataset capturing human gaze during chart reasoning tasks. Proposed gaze-guided attention refinement that aligns model's image-text attention with human fixations.

Result: The approach improved answer accuracy by up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models and enhanced attention alignment with human gaze patterns.

Conclusion: Incorporating human gaze data enhances both reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs, demonstrating the promise of using human attention patterns to guide model behavior.

Abstract: Charts are a crucial visual medium for communicating and representing
information. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on
chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when
models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present
ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during
chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model
attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced
interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided
attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our
approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains
of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results
demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the
reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 6 challenging benchmarks, surpassing frontier proprietary systems. Training data enhances tool-use capabilities even for traditional methods, and enables parallel multi-agent exploration.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges passive knowledge recall and active knowledge construction, demonstrating scalable and effective autonomous research capabilities through iterative deep-research and systematic data synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep-research systems have demonstrated the potential for
AI agents to autonomously discover and synthesize knowledge from external
sources. In this paper, we introduce WebResearcher, a novel framework for
building such agents through two key components: (1) WebResearcher, an
iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates deep research as a Markov
Decision Process, where agents periodically consolidate findings into evolving
reports while maintaining focused workspaces, overcoming the context
suffocation and noise contamination that plague existing mono-contextual
approaches; and (2) WebFrontier, a scalable data synthesis engine that
generates high-quality training data through tool-augmented complexity
escalation, enabling systematic creation of research tasks that bridge the gap
between passive knowledge recall and active knowledge construction. Notably, we
find that the training data from our paradigm significantly enhances tool-use
capabilities even for traditional mono-contextual methods. Furthermore, our
paradigm naturally scales through parallel thinking, enabling concurrent
multi-agent exploration for more comprehensive conclusions. Extensive
experiments across 6 challenging benchmarks demonstrate that WebResearcher
achieves state-of-the-art performance, even surpassing frontier proprietary

Result: AgentFounder-30B achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 benchmarks: 39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE, while retaining strong tool-use ability.

Conclusion: Agentic CPT effectively addresses optimization tensions in agentic task training and enables the development of powerful agentic foundation models that outperform traditional post-training approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of
autonomous tool use and multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation
models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source
implementations. We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic
foundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn
diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby
creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to
propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the
deep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational
models. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named
AgentFounder. We evaluate our AgentFounder-30B on 10 benchmarks and achieve
state-of-the-art performance while retains strong tool-use ability, notably
39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE.

TL;DR: AgentScaler framework scales up simulated environments to train LLMs for better function-calling capabilities, using automated environment construction and two-phase fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications require advanced agentic intelligence with precise function-calling capabilities, which depends on training in diverse environments. Current limitations in environment diversity constrain agent development.

Method: Automated framework for constructing heterogeneous simulated environments, plus two-phase agent fine-tuning: first building fundamental capabilities, then domain-specific specialization.

Result: AgentScaler model significantly enhances function-calling capabilities, demonstrating superior performance on agentic benchmarks including tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench.

Conclusion: Scaling environments through principled automated construction and strategic agent training effectively advances general agentic intelligence and function-calling capabilities for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Advanced agentic intelligence is a prerequisite for deploying Large Language
Models in practical, real-world applications. Diverse real-world APIs demand
precise, robust function-calling intelligence, which needs agents to develop
these capabilities through interaction in varied environments. The breadth of
function-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in
which agents are trained. In this work, we scale up environments as a step
towards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central
challenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how
to effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through
interactions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable
framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are
fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling
scenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first
endowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them
for domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks,
tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model,
AgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models.

TL;DR: WebWeaver introduces a dual-agent framework that iteratively plans and writes research reports, addressing long-context issues and hallucinations through dynamic evidence acquisition and hierarchical writing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI research approaches suffer from static pipelines that separate planning from evidence gathering, and one-shot generation that leads to long-context failures and hallucinations in open-ended deep research tasks.

Method: A dual-agent framework with a planner that iteratively interleaves evidence acquisition with outline optimization, and a writer that performs hierarchical retrieval and section-by-section writing using targeted evidence from a memory bank.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across major OEDR benchmarks including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and DeepResearchGym.

Conclusion: The human-centric iterative methodology with adaptive planning and focused synthesis is crucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured research reports.

Abstract: This paper tackles open-ended deep research (OEDR), a complex challenge where
AI agents must synthesize vast web-scale information into insightful reports.
Current approaches are plagued by dual-fold limitations: static research
pipelines that decouple planning from evidence acquisition and one-shot
generation paradigms that easily suffer from long-context failure issues like
"loss in the middle" and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we
introduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human
research process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively
interleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a
comprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.
The writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,
composing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of
only the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively
mitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art
across major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and
DeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative
methodology, demonstrating that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are
crucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured reports.

TL;DR: ReSum enables LLM web agents to overcome context window limitations through periodic summarization, allowing indefinite exploration while maintaining reasoning state. ReSum-GRPO training further enhances performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based web agents struggle with complex queries requiring extensive search cycles due to context window constraints in paradigms like ReAct.

Method: Introduces ReSum paradigm with periodic context summarization to convert growing interaction histories into compact reasoning states. Proposes ReSum-GRPO integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and advantage broadcasting.

Result: ReSum delivers 4.5% average improvement over ReAct, with up to 8.2% gains after ReSum-GRPO training. WebResummer-30B achieves 33.3% Pass@1 on BrowseComp-zh and 18.3% on BrowseComp-en.

Conclusion: ReSum effectively overcomes context limitations for web agents, enabling indefinite exploration and superior performance with minimal training data.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on
knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in
paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined
relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly
exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this
challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite
exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing
interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of
prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,
we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and
advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned
reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three
benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of
4.5\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\% following ReSum-GRPO
training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a
ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\% Pass@1 on
BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web
agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Activation verbalization methods using a second LLM to interpret target model representations may not provide meaningful insights into internal workings, as they often reflect the verbalizer's parametric knowledge rather than actual target model activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically evaluate whether current activation verbalization methods actually provide privileged knowledge about LLM internal representations or merely convey information about inputs using the verbalizer's existing knowledge.

Method: Evaluated popular verbalization methods across datasets from prior work, conducted controlled experiments to assess whether verbalizations reflect target model activations or the verbalizer LLM's parametric knowledge.

Result: Verbalization methods succeeded at benchmarks without access to target model internals, and controlled experiments revealed verbalizations often reflect the verbalizer LLM's knowledge rather than the target model's actual activations.

Conclusion: There is a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful insights into LLM operations, as current approaches may not reveal actual internal workings.

Abstract: Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal
representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer
LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and
operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually
provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model,
or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate
popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that
they succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals,
suggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization
methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations
often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated
them, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken
together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental
controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful
insights into the operations of LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces DISPLIB - a common problem definition and file format for train re-routing and rescheduling to enable reproducibility and performance comparisons across different optimization algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of reproducibility and standardized problem definitions in train dispatching research, with each study tied to specific industrial cases and no shared code/data preventing fair algorithm comparisons.

Method: Created a common problem definition (DISPLIB) and file format that captures main features of train re-routing/rescheduling, gathered real-world problem instances, and developed a reference solver implementation.

Result: Established an open standard with multiple real-world instances available, enabling researchers to work on train dispatching without industrial connections and perform empirical solver comparisons.

Conclusion: DISPLIB provides a foundation for reproducible research and fair performance assessment in train dispatching optimization, similar to established communities like MILP, SAT, TSP, and VRP.

Abstract: Optimization-based decision support systems have a significant potential to
reduce delays, and thus improve efficiency on the railways, by automatically
re-routing and re-scheduling trains after delays have occurred. The operations
research community has dedicated a lot of effort to developing optimization
algorithms for this problem, but each study is typically tightly connected with
a specific industrial use case. Code and data are seldom shared publicly. This
fact hinders reproducibility, and has led to a proliferation of papers
describing algorithms for more or less compatible problem definitions, without
any real opportunity for readers to assess their relative performance. Inspired
by the successful communities around MILP, SAT, TSP, VRP, etc., we introduce a
common problem definition and file format, DISPLIB, which captures all the main
features of train re-routing and re-scheduling. We have gathered problem
instances from multiple real-world use cases and made them openly available. In
this paper, we describe the problem definition, the industrial instances, and a
reference solver implementation. This allows any researcher or developer to
work on the train dispatching problem without an industrial connection, and
enables the research community to perform empirical comparisons between
solvers. All materials are available online at https://displib.github.io.

### [157] [InPhyRe Discovers: Large Multimodal Models Struggle in Inductive Physical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12263)
*Gautam Sreekumar,Vishnu Naresh Boddeti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InPhyRe is the first benchmark to evaluate inductive physical reasoning in LMMs, showing they struggle with adapting to unseen physical environments and suffer from language bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMMs only encode parametric knowledge from training data and cannot adapt to scenarios that violate known physical laws, which is critical for safety-critical applications where human-like adaptive reasoning is needed.

Method: Proposed InPhyRe benchmark using algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos to test LMMs' ability to predict collision outcomes in unseen physical environments that violate universal physical laws.

Result: Evaluation of 13 LMMs revealed they: (1) struggle to apply parametric knowledge to reasoning, (2) have weak inductive reasoning when demonstrations violate physical laws, and (3) suffer from language bias and ignore visual inputs.

Conclusion: LMMs currently lack trustworthy inductive physical reasoning capabilities, questioning their reliability for visual-based reasoning in safety-critical applications where adaptation to novel physical environments is required.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) encode universal physical laws observed during
training, such as momentum conservation, as parametric knowledge. It allows
LMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential
collision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes
only the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning
when the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans
possess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical
environments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as
inductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace
human agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing
visual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not
inductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual
question answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.
InPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision
events in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting
13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited
parametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive
physical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal
physical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from
language bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the
trustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based route planning approaches struggle with extensive map data and natural language preference understanding, while facing challenges from heterogeneous global user distribution.

Method: Uses LLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language and extract preferences, coupled with Multi-Step Graph construction with iterative Search algorithm for route optimization with adaptive objective weight tuning.

Result: Superior performance with guarantees across multiple constraints demonstrated through 1,000 routing prompts across 14 countries and 27 cities with varying complexity.

Conclusion: The LLMAP system effectively bridges the gap between natural language understanding and optimal route planning, handling complex constraints and achieving high POI quality and task completion rates.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has made natural language-driven
route planning an emerging research area that encompasses rich user objectives.
Current research exhibits two distinct approaches: direct route planning using
LLM-as-Agent and graph-based searching strategies. However, LLMs in the former
approach struggle to handle extensive map data, while the latter shows limited
capability in understanding natural language preferences. Additionally, a more
critical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable
spatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we
introduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an
LLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user
preferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph
construction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver
for optimal route finding. Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively
tunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task
completion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key
constraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies. We
conduct extensive experiments using 1,000 routing prompts sampled with varying
complexity across 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior performance with guarantees across multiple
constraints.

Motivation: To improve crop production through continuous monitoring and control of greenhouse environmental conditions, enabling prompt management decisions using IoT and AI technologies.

Method: Developed an IoT-based platform for environmental monitoring and control, and implemented an AI disease detection framework using VGG-19, InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze plant images after intentional inoculation.

Result: IoT system successfully published real-time data (temperature, humidity, water flow, tank volume) and adjusted parameters for optimal growth. VGG-19 algorithm achieved highest accuracy (92%) in identifying drought stress and rust leaves from healthy leaves.

Conclusion: The integration of IoT and AI technologies provides an effective smart greenhouse solution for continuous environmental monitoring and early disease detection, with VGG-19 showing superior performance in plant health assessment.

Abstract: Controlling environmental conditions and monitoring plant status in
greenhouses is critical to promptly making appropriate management decisions
aimed at promoting crop production. The primary objective of this research
study was to develop and test a smart aeroponic greenhouse on an experimental
scale where the status of Geranium plant and environmental conditions are
continuously monitored through the integration of the internet of things (IoT)
and artificial intelligence (AI). An IoT-based platform was developed to
control the environmental conditions of plants more efficiently and provide
insights to users to make informed management decisions. In addition, we
developed an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19,
InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze the images captured
periodically after an intentional inoculation. The performance of the AI
framework was compared with an expert's evaluation of disease status.
Preliminary results showed that the IoT system implemented in the greenhouse
environment is able to publish data such as temperature, humidity, water flow,
and volume of charge tanks online continuously to users and adjust the
controlled parameters to provide an optimal growth environment for the plants.
Furthermore, the results of the AI framework demonstrate that the VGG-19
algorithm was able to identify drought stress and rust leaves from healthy
leaves with the highest accuracy, 92% among the other algorithms.

TL;DR: AIssistant is an open-source Human-AI collaborative framework that simplifies scientific workflow creation, improving drafting efficiency and thematic consistency while maintaining human oversight for accuracy and rigor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-assisted research tools are fragmented and lack human-centered workflows, creating a need for integrated systems that support end-to-end scientific paper creation with proper human oversight.

Method: Developed an agentic framework with modular tools for literature synthesis, experimentation, citation management, and LaTeX generation. Evaluated through three layers: independent human review (NeurIPS standards), automated LLM review (GPT-5), and program chair oversight.

Result: AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and thematic consistency. However, limitations include hallucinated citations, difficulty adapting to dynamic paper structures, and incomplete multimodal content integration.

Conclusion: Human-AI collaboration remains essential for maintaining factual correctness and ethical compliance. The framework shows promise but requires further development to address current limitations in citation accuracy and structural adaptability.

Abstract: Advances in AI-assisted research have introduced powerful tools for
literature retrieval, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript
preparation. However, systems remain fragmented and lack human-centred
workflows. To address these gaps, we introduce AIssistant, an agentic,
open-source Human-AI collaborative framework designed to simplify the
end-to-end creation of scientific workflows. Since our development is still in
an early stage, we present here the first experiments with AIssistant for
perspective and review research papers in machine learning. Our system
integrates modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise
experimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX paper text
generation, while maintaining human oversight at every stage to ensure
accuracy, coherence, and scholarly rigour. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation across three layers: (1) Independent Human Review, following NeurIPS
double-blind standards; (2) Automated LLM Review, using GPT-5 as a scalable
human review proxy; and (3) Program Chair Oversight, where the chair monitors
the entire review process and makes final validation and acceptance decisions.
The results demonstrate that AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and
thematic consistency. Nonetheless, Human-AI collaboration remains essential for
maintaining factual correctness, methodological soundness, and ethical
compliance. Despite its effectiveness, we identify key limitations, including
hallucinated citations, difficulty adapting to dynamic paper structures, and
incomplete integration of multimodal content.

TL;DR: A decomposed approach for on-device intent inference from UI interactions using structured summarization and fine-tuned models, outperforming large MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small on-device models struggle with accurate intent inference from UI interaction trajectories, while large MLLMs require datacenter resources and lack privacy preservation.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) structured interaction summarization to capture key information from each user action, 2) intent extraction using fine-tuned models on aggregated summaries.

Result: Improved intent understanding in resource-constrained models, surpassing base performance of large multi-modal large language models (MLLMs).

Conclusion: The decomposed approach enables effective on-device intent inference with privacy preservation, low cost, and low latency while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Understanding user intents from UI interaction trajectories remains a
challenging, yet crucial, frontier in intelligent agent development. While
massive, datacenter-based, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess
greater capacity to handle the complexities of such sequences, smaller models
which can run on-device to provide a privacy-preserving, low-cost, and
low-latency user experience, struggle with accurate intent inference. We
address these limitations by introducing a novel decomposed approach: first, we
perform structured interaction summarization, capturing key information from
each user action. Second, we perform intent extraction using a fine-tuned model
operating on the aggregated summaries. This method improves intent
understanding in resource-constrained models, even surpassing the base
performance of large MLLMs.

*Jiahao Yu,Zelei Cheng,Xian Wu,Xinyu Xing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new framework called \sys enhances preference optimization algorithms to preserve output diversity and handle multi-turn interactions for software engineering tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on SWE-bench with models up to 106B parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with complex software engineering tasks that require multi-step reasoning and tool use. Standard alignment methods like DPO and KTO reduce output diversity, limiting test-time scaling effectiveness, and existing algorithms don't handle multi-turn interactions well for coding agents.

Method: \sys framework augments preference objectives to explicitly preserve policy entropy and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than single responses. Uses hybrid best-trajectory selection combining learned verifier with model-free approaches.

Result: Achieved new state-of-the-art results on SWE-bench leaderboard among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranked 1st on Lite and 4th on Verified benchmarks, surpassed only by models with 10x more parameters.

Conclusion: The entropy-enhanced framework successfully bridges the gap in multi-turn preference optimization for software engineering tasks, enabling better test-time scaling and superior performance on real-world coding challenges.

Abstract: Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and
coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by
benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve
real-world issues.
  A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but
its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.
  While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs
with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity,
limiting the effectiveness of TTS.
  Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically
designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of
multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding
agents.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that
adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn,
tool-assisted setting.
  \sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy
and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than
single-turn responses.
  We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different
families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).
  To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid
best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model
free approaches.
  On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art
results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranks
1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed
only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between model size and performance in world models, making accurate physics predictions practical for edge devices.

Method: Physics-Informed BEV World Model with Soft Mask training for dynamic object modeling and Warm Start inference technique for zero-shot quality improvement.

Result: At 400M parameters, PIWM surpasses baseline by 60.6% in weighted overall score. Even the smallest PIWM (130M) outperforms largest baseline (400M) by 7.4% with 28% faster inference.

Conclusion: PIWM demonstrates that compact models can achieve superior performance and efficiency through physics-informed design and specialized training/inference techniques.

Abstract: A major challenge in deploying world models is the trade-off between size and
performance. Large world models can capture rich physical dynamics but require
massive computing resources, making them impractical for edge devices. Small
world models are easier to deploy but often struggle to learn accurate physics,
leading to poor predictions. We propose the Physics-Informed BEV World Model
(PIWM), a compact model designed to efficiently capture physical interactions
in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations. PIWM uses Soft Mask during training
to improve dynamic object modeling and future prediction. We also introduce a
simple yet effective technique, Warm Start, for inference to enhance prediction
quality with a zero-shot model. Experiments show that at the same parameter
scale (400M), PIWM surpasses the baseline by 60.6% in weighted overall score.
Moreover, even when compared with the largest baseline model (400M), the
smallest PIWM (130M Soft Mask) achieves a 7.4% higher weighted overall score
with a 28% faster inference speed.

TL;DR: Reasoning-Aware Compression (RAC) improves pruning for reasoning models by jointly reconstructing input and chain-of-thought traces, preventing performance degradation seen in standard pruning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM pruning methods cause significant performance loss in reasoning models and can even slow them down by making them produce more thinking tokens with worse results, due to focusing only on input reconstruction rather than reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduces Reasoning-Aware Compression (RAC) that during pruning jointly reconstructs activations from both the input and the model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces, integrating seamlessly with existing pruning workflows like SparseGPT.

Result: RAC significantly boosts pruning performance for reasoning models compared to standard compression techniques that cause greater performance loss in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: A simple drop-in fix that makes pruning reasoning-aware by incorporating chain-of-thought reconstruction prevents the performance degradation and slowdown issues seen in traditional pruning methods for reasoning language models.

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as DeepSeek-R1 produce long chain-of-thought
traces during inference time which make them costly to deploy at scale. We show
that using compression techniques such as neural network pruning produces
greater performance loss than in typical language modeling tasks, and in some
cases can make the model slower since they cause the model to produce more
thinking tokens but with worse performance. We show that this is partly due to
the fact that standard LLM pruning methods often focus on input reconstruction,
whereas reasoning is a decode-dominated task. We introduce a simple, drop-in
fix: during pruning we jointly reconstruct activations from the input and the
model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces. This "Reasoning-Aware Compression"
(RAC) integrates seamlessly into existing pruning workflows such as SparseGPT,
and boosts their performance significantly. Code reproducing the results in the

TL;DR: The paper maps computational complexity concepts from the Soma Cube puzzle to cognitive problem-solving strategies, showing how material artifacts and cognitive strategies reduce task difficulty by lowering branching factors and effective time complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge cognitive science and theoretical computer science by classifying task difficulty and explaining how mechanisms of intelligence (both cognitive strategies and material artifacts) reduce complexity in problem-solving.

Method: Analyzed the Soma Cube puzzle's branching factor through search tree outdegree measurements. Systematically layered cognitive strategies including preprocessing (chunking), value ordering (free-sorting), variable ordering (scaffolding), and pruning (inference) onto trial-and-error search.

Result: Demonstrated quantitatively how different cognitive strategies modify complexity. Showed that competent use of artifacts reduces effective time complexity by exploiting physical constraints.

Conclusion: Proposes a model of intelligence as a library of algorithms that recruit both mental capabilities and material resources, with the "Principle of Materiality" connecting computational complexity to cognitive problem-solving through physical constraints.

Abstract: Cognitive science and theoretical computer science both seek to classify and
explain the difficulty of tasks. Mechanisms of intelligence are those that
reduce task difficulty. Here we map concepts from the computational complexity
of a physical puzzle, the Soma Cube, onto cognitive problem-solving strategies
through a ``Principle of Materiality''. By analyzing the puzzle's branching
factor, measured through search tree outdegree, we quantitatively assess task
difficulty and systematically examine how different strategies modify
complexity. We incrementally refine a trial-and-error search by layering
preprocessing (cognitive chunking), value ordering (cognitive free-sorting),
variable ordering (cognitive scaffolding), and pruning (cognitive inference).
We discuss how the competent use of artifacts reduces effective time complexity
by exploiting physical constraints and propose a model of intelligence as a
library of algorithms that recruit the capabilities of both mind and matter.

*Rohit Chakraborty,Subasish Das*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study analyzes Ohio roundabout crashes using a two-step explainable workflow combining Cluster Correspondence Analysis and tree-based severity modeling with SHAP to identify crash patterns and quantify injury risk factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While roundabouts reduce severe crashes overall, risk patterns vary significantly by conditions, requiring better understanding of specific factors that contribute to injury severity in different scenarios.

Method: Two-step explainable workflow: 1) Cluster Correspondence Analysis (CCA) to identify co-occurring factors and four crash patterns, 2) Tree-based severity model interpreted with SHAP to quantify injury drivers within and across patterns.

Result: Higher severity occurs when darkness, wet surfaces, and higher speeds coincide with fixed-object or angle events. Lower severity in clear, low-speed settings. Pattern-specific explanations reveal mechanisms at entries (fail-to-yield), within circulation (improper maneuvers), and during slow-downs (rear-end).

Conclusion: The workflow effectively links pattern discovery with case-level explanations, supporting site screening, countermeasure selection, and audit-ready reporting. Provides a practical template for usable XAI in public safety analytics.

Abstract: Roundabouts reduce severe crashes, yet risk patterns vary by conditions. This
study analyzes 2017-2021 Ohio roundabout crashes using a two-step, explainable
workflow. Cluster Correspondence Analysis (CCA) identifies co-occurring factors
and yields four crash patterns. A tree-based severity model is then interpreted
with SHAP to quantify drivers of injury within and across patterns. Results
show higher severity when darkness, wet surfaces, and higher posted speeds
coincide with fixed-object or angle events, and lower severity in clear,
low-speed settings. Pattern-specific explanations highlight mechanisms at
entries (fail-to-yield, gap acceptance), within multi-lane circulation
(improper maneuvers), and during slow-downs (rear-end). The workflow links
pattern discovery with case-level explanations, supporting site screening,
countermeasure selection, and audit-ready reporting. The contribution to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Customer experience in contact centers suffers from high handling times, low resolution rates, and poor satisfaction due to agent cognitive load from fragmented systems and manual troubleshooting.

Method: Developed Agentic AI - goal-driven, autonomous systems that proactively support agents with real-time transcription, intent/sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval, dynamic profiling, and partial conversation summaries.

Result: Minerva CQ deployed as AI co-pilot in live production, delivering measurable improvements in agent efficiency and customer experience across multiple deployments.

Conclusion: Agentic AI systems like Minerva CQ represent a significant advancement over reactive AI tools by providing proactive, context-aware assistance that addresses core challenges in contact center operations.

Abstract: Despite advances in AI for contact centers, customer experience (CX)
continues to suffer from high average handling time (AHT), low first-call
resolution, and poor customer satisfaction (CSAT). A key driver is the
cognitive load on agents, who must navigate fragmented systems, troubleshoot
manually, and frequently place customers on hold. Existing AI-powered
agent-assist tools are often reactive driven by static rules, simple prompting,
or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) without deeper contextual reasoning. We
introduce Agentic AI goal-driven, autonomous, tool-using systems that
proactively support agents in real time. Unlike conventional approaches,
Agentic AI identifies customer intent, triggers modular workflows, maintains
evolving context, and adapts dynamically to conversation state. This paper
presents a case study of Minerva CQ, a real-time Agent Assist product deployed
in voice-based customer support. Minerva CQ integrates real-time transcription,
intent and sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval,
dynamic customer profiling, and partial conversational summaries enabling
proactive workflows and continuous context-building. Deployed in live
production, Minerva CQ acts as an AI co-pilot, delivering measurable
improvements in agent efficiency and customer experience across multiple

*Minyu Chen,Guoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DaSAThco is a framework that uses LLMs to create adaptive heuristic ensembles for SAT solvers, enabling robust generalization across different problem types without re-optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAT solver performance depends on internal heuristics, but no single configuration works optimally for all problems. Existing automated methods require costly re-optimization for each problem family and lack generalizability.

Method: Uses Large Language Model guided by Problem Archetypes to generate diverse heuristic ensembles, then learns an adaptive selection mechanism to map instance features to appropriate heuristic configurations.

Result: DaSAThco achieves superior performance and demonstrates robust out-of-domain generalization, outperforming non-adaptive methods that show limitations in generalization.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a scalable and practical approach for automated algorithm design in complex, configurable systems, enabling train-once, adapt-broadly capability.

Abstract: The performance of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning solvers hinges on internal
heuristics, yet the heterogeneity of SAT problems makes a single, universally
optimal configuration unattainable. While prior automated methods can find
specialized configurations for specific problem families, this dataset-specific
approach lacks generalizability and requires costly re-optimization for new
problem types. We introduce DaSAThco, a framework that addresses this challenge
by learning a generalizable mapping from instance features to tailored
heuristic ensembles, enabling a train-once, adapt-broadly model. Our framework
uses a Large Language Model, guided by systematically defined Problem
Archetypes, to generate a diverse portfolio of specialized heuristic ensembles
and subsequently learns an adaptive selection mechanism to form the final
mapping. Experiments show that DaSAThco achieves superior performance and, most
notably, demonstrates robust out-of-domain generalization where non-adaptive
methods show limitations. Our work establishes a more scalable and practical
path toward automated algorithm design for complex, configurable systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AD-FCoT is a prompting framework that combines analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought prompting to improve financial news sentiment analysis by drawing parallels between current events and historical scenarios with known outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing financial sentiment analysis methods struggle to capture complex economic context and lack transparent reasoning, undermining reliability. LLMs show strong text understanding but need better frameworks for financial analysis.

Method: AD-FCoT guides LLMs to create structured reasoning chains by drawing analogies between new financial events and relevant historical scenarios with known outcomes, using only prompting without additional training or fine-tuning.

Result: AD-FCoT outperforms baselines in sentiment classification accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns. Generated explanations align with domain expertise and provide interpretable insights.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates analogical reasoning with CoT prompting, demonstrating improved performance and interpretability for financial sentiment analysis without requiring additional training data.

Abstract: Financial news sentiment analysis is crucial for anticipating market
movements. With the rise of AI techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs),
which demonstrate strong text understanding capabilities, there has been
renewed interest in enhancing these systems. Existing methods, however, often
struggle to capture the complex economic context of news and lack transparent
reasoning, which undermines their reliability. We propose Analogy-Driven
Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT), a prompting framework that integrates
analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for sentiment
prediction on historical financial news. AD-FCoT guides LLMs to draw parallels
between new events and relevant historical scenarios with known outcomes,
embedding these analogies into a structured, step-by-step reasoning chain. To
our knowledge, this is among the first approaches to explicitly combine
analogical examples with CoT reasoning in finance. Operating purely through
prompting, AD-FCoT requires no additional training data or fine-tuning and
leverages the model's internal financial knowledge to generate rationales that
mirror human analytical reasoning. Experiments on thousands of news articles
show that AD-FCoT outperforms strong baselines in sentiment classification
accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns. Its
generated explanations also align with domain expertise, providing
interpretable insights suitable for real-world financial analysis.

TL;DR: GBV-SQL is a multi-agent framework that uses SQL2Text back-translation validation to ensure generated SQL queries correctly interpret user intent, while also identifying systemic issues with benchmark quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the semantic gap where syntactically valid SQL queries often misinterpret user intent, and highlight the problem of poor benchmark quality that obscures true model performance.

Method: Multi-agent framework with Guided Generation and SQL2Text Back-translation Validation, where a specialized agent translates generated SQL back to natural language to verify logical alignment with the original question.

Result: Achieves 63.23% execution accuracy on BIRD benchmark (5.8% absolute improvement) and 96.5% (dev) / 97.6% (test) execution accuracy on Spider benchmark after removing flawed examples.

Conclusion: GBV-SQL provides both a robust semantic validation framework and critical insights into benchmark integrity, demonstrating the need for more rigorous dataset curation in Text2SQL evaluation.

Abstract: While Large Language Models have significantly advanced Text2SQL generation,
a critical semantic gap persists where syntactically valid queries often
misinterpret user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose GBV-SQL, a
novel multi-agent framework that introduces Guided Generation with SQL2Text
Back-translation Validation. This mechanism uses a specialized agent to
translate the generated SQL back into natural language, which verifies its
logical alignment with the original question. Critically, our investigation
reveals that current evaluation is undermined by a systemic issue: the poor
quality of the benchmarks themselves. We introduce a formal typology for "Gold
Errors", which are pervasive flaws in the ground-truth data, and demonstrate
how they obscure true model performance. On the challenging BIRD benchmark,
GBV-SQL achieves 63.23% execution accuracy, a 5.8% absolute improvement. After
removing flawed examples, GBV-SQL achieves 96.5% (dev) and 97.6% (test)
execution accuracy on the Spider benchmark. Our work offers both a robust
framework for semantic validation and a critical perspective on benchmark
integrity, highlighting the need for more rigorous dataset curation.

TL;DR: Random Forest model outperforms SVR and LSTM for predicting cattle weight gain, achieving R²=0.973 when including weather and age factors, with an automated preprocessing tool developed for dataset preparation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting mob-based cattle weight gain can help farmers optimize feeding strategies, make better breeding decisions, and mitigate risks from climate variability and market fluctuations.

Method: Used Random Forest model compared against SVR and LSTM models on 756 samples from 108 cattle, incorporating weather data (rainfall, temperature) and age factors for monthly weight gain prediction.

Result: RF model performed best across all datasets with R²=0.973, RMSE=0.040, and MAE=0.033 when both weather and age factors were included, significantly outperforming SVR and LSTM models.

Conclusion: RF is a robust tool for cattle weight gain forecasting, with weather and age factors being crucial for accuracy. An automated preprocessing tool was developed and made publicly available for future research.

Abstract: Forecasting mob based cattle weight gain (MB CWG) may benefit large livestock
farms, allowing farmers to refine their feeding strategies, make educated
breeding choices, and reduce risks linked to climate variability and market
fluctuations. In this paper, a novel technique termed MB CWG is proposed to
forecast the one month advanced weight gain of herd based cattle using
historical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research
employs a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support
Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for monthly
weight gain prediction. Four datasets were used to evaluate the performance of
models, using 756 sample data from 108 herd-based cattle, along with weather
data (rainfall and temperature) influencing CWG. The RF model performs better
than the SVR and LSTM models across all datasets, achieving an R^2 of 0.973,
RMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were
included. The results indicate that including both weather and age factors
significantly improves the accuracy of weight gain predictions, with the RF
model outperforming the SVR and LSTM models in all scenarios. These findings
demonstrate the potential of RF as a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight
gain in variable conditions, highlighting the influence of age and climatic
factors on herd based weight trends. This study has also developed an
innovative automated pre processing tool to generate a benchmark dataset for MB
CWG predictive models. The tool is publicly available on GitHub and can assist
in preparing datasets for current and future analytical research..

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ECG-aBcDe is a novel ECG encoding method that transforms ECG signals into a universal language interpretable by any LLM, enabling direct fine-tuning without architectural changes while improving interpretability and time-scale information capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based ECG analysis methods face challenges with transferability across different LLMs, difficulty capturing time-scale information due to Transformer limitations, and lack of interpretability which hinders clinical adoption.

Method: Developed ECG-aBcDe encoding method that converts ECG signals into a universal ECG language, created hybrid dataset of ECG language and natural language, enabling direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs without architectural modifications.

Result: Achieved competitive performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR, with significant improvements in BLEU-4 scores (2.8x and 3.9x improvements in in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, reaching 42.58 and 30.76 respectively).

Conclusion: ECG-aBcDe presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis with LLMs, providing strong evidence for feasibility through improved performance metrics and enhanced interpretability features.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for electrocardiogram
(ECG) analysis, yet challenges remain regarding transferability, time-scale
information learning, and interpretability. Current methods suffer from
model-specific ECG encoders, hindering transfer across LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs
struggle to capture crucial time-scale information inherent in ECGs due to
Transformer limitations. And their black-box nature limits clinical adoption.
To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-aBcDe, a novel ECG encoding
method that transforms ECG signals into a universal ECG language readily
interpretable by any LLM. By constructing a hybrid dataset of ECG language and
natural language, ECG-aBcDe enables direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs
without architectural modifications, achieving "construct once, use anywhere"
capability. Moreover, the bidirectional convertibility between ECG and ECG
language of ECG-aBcDe allows for extracting attention heatmaps from ECG
signals, significantly enhancing interpretability. Finally, ECG-aBcDe
explicitly represents time-scale information, mitigating Transformer
limitations. This work presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis
with LLMs. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves competitive
performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR. Notably, it delivers significant
improvements in the BLEU-4, with improvements of 2.8 times and 3.9 times in
in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, respectively, reaching scores of
42.58 and 30.76. These results provide strong evidence for the feasibility of
the new paradigm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoCO is an end-to-end automated constraint optimization method that uses LLMs to generate constraint relaxation strategies for nonlinear combinatorial optimization problems, combining evolutionary algorithms and Monte Carlo Tree Search for effective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional constraint relaxation approaches for nonlinear combinatorial optimization problems (NCOPs) lack systematic automation and scalability, while current LLM-based methods only serve as passive constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects.

Method: AutoCO leverages structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies through a unified triple-representation scheme, and employs a bidirectional coevolution mechanism integrating Evolutionary Algorithms for local refinement with Monte Carlo Tree Search for global strategy exploration.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP benchmarks demonstrate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance over baseline methods.

Conclusion: AutoCO represents the first end-to-end automated constraint optimization method that successfully revolutionizes NCOP resolution through learning to relax with LLMs, achieving optimal balance between intensification and diversification in complex solution spaces.

Abstract: Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems (NCOPs) present a formidable
computational hurdle in practice, as their nonconvex nature gives rise to
multi-modal solution spaces that defy efficient optimization. Traditional
constraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterative
design processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability.
While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promise
for autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passive
constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing to
handle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent to NCOPs.To address
these limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated
\textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizes
NCOPs resolution through learning to relax with LLMs.Specifically, we leverage
structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, which
are dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable code
through a unified triple-representation scheme. We further establish a novel
bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically
integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte
Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring
optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented
solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP
benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance
over the baselines.

*Lachlan McGinness,Peter Baumgartner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Longitudinal study shows frontier LLMs improved reasoning accuracy from 2023-2025 through Chain of Thought prompting and thinking models. Neuro-symbolic approach using smaller LLMs with Z3 solver achieves near-perfect performance with significantly reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the evolution of reasoning capabilities in large language models over time and develop a more computationally efficient approach to logical reasoning tasks.

Method: Conducted longitudinal evaluation of three leading models on PrOntoQA true/false questions, measured faithfulness to reasoning strategies. Developed neuro-symbolic architecture using sub-15B parameter LLMs to translate problems into standardized form, then parsed by Z3 SMT solver.

Result: Significant performance improvement from 2023-2024 (attributed to Chain of Thought) and 2024-2025 (thinking models). Neuro-symbolic approach maintained near-perfect accuracy while drastically reducing computational costs. FLOP estimation formula proved accurate within 10%.

Conclusion: Frontier LLMs show continuous reasoning improvement over time. Neuro-symbolic methods enable efficient logical reasoning with smaller models, reducing computational burden while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: We present a longitudinal study which evaluates the reasoning capability of
frontier Large Language Models over an eighteen month period. We measured the
accuracy of three leading models from December 2023, September 2024 and June
2025 on true or false questions from the PrOntoQA dataset and their
faithfulness to reasoning strategies provided through in-context learning. The
improvement in performance from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to hidden Chain
of Thought prompting. The introduction of thinking models allowed for
significant improvement in model performance between 2024 and 2025.
  We then present a neuro-symbolic architecture which uses LLMs of less than 15
billion parameters to translate the problems into a standardised form. We then
parse the standardised forms of the problems into a program to be solved by Z3,
an SMT solver, to determine the satisfiability of the query. We report the
number of prompt and completion tokens as well as the computational cost in
FLOPs for open source models. The neuro-symbolic approach significantly reduces
the computational cost while maintaining near perfect performance. The common
approximation that the number of inference FLOPs is double the product of the
active parameters and total tokens was accurate within 10\% for all
experiments.

*Hanqing Li,Kiran Sheena Jyothi,Henry Liang,Sharika Mahadevan,Diego Klabjan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GRRAF is a training-free method that combines retrieval-augmented generation with LLMs' code-generation capabilities for graph reasoning tasks, achieving near-perfect accuracy on most tasks while scaling to large graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing methods that require extensive finetuning or predefined algorithms for graph reasoning tasks, providing a more flexible and efficient approach.

Method: Stores target graphs in a database and prompts LLMs to generate executable code queries for information retrieval, incorporating an error feedback loop with time-out mechanism for correctness and efficiency.

Result: Achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks (cycle detection, bipartite checks, shortest path, max flow), scales to 10,000 nodes, maintains consistent token costs regardless of graph size, and shows high performance on subgraph matching.

Conclusion: GRRAF provides an effective training-free framework for graph reasoning that leverages RAG and LLM code-generation capabilities, demonstrating strong performance and scalability across various graph tasks.

Abstract: We propose a new, training-free method, Graph Reasoning via Retrieval
Augmented Framework (GRRAF), that harnesses retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) alongside the code-generation capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to address a wide range of graph reasoning tasks. In GRRAF, the target
graph is stored in a graph database, and the LLM is prompted to generate
executable code queries that retrieve the necessary information. This approach
circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive
finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error
feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and
efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that
GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle
detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow,
while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect
but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably,
GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.

### [180] [H$^2$R: Hierarchical Hindsight Reflection for Multi-Task LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12810)
*Shicheng Ye,Chao Yu,Kaiqiang Ke,Chengdong Xu,Yinqi Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: H$^2$R introduces hierarchical memory architecture for LLM-based agents, separating high-level planning from low-level execution memory to enable fine-grained knowledge transfer across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat prior experiences as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained knowledge transfer in multi-task scenarios for LLM-based agents.

Method: Proposes hierarchical memory architecture with Hierarchical Hindsight Reflection (H$^2$R) mechanism that distills reusable hierarchical knowledge from past interactions, enabling separate retrieval of high-level and low-level memories.

Result: Experimental results across two benchmarks show improved generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior baselines like Expel.

Conclusion: H$^2$R enables more efficient and fine-grained knowledge transfer for LLM-based agents through hierarchical memory separation and hindsight reflection.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown strong potential in
multi-task scenarios, owing to their ability to transfer knowledge across
diverse tasks. However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and
knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained
knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical memory
architecture that enables fine-grained knowledge transfer by decoupling
high-level planning memory from low-level execution memory. To construct and
refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight
Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical
knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R
performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing
LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for
new tasks.Experimental results across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R
can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior
baselines such as Expel.

### [181] [LTA-thinker: Latent Thought-Augmented Training Framework for Large Language Models on Complex Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12875)
*Jiaqi Wang,Binquan Ji,Haibo Luo,Yiyang Qi,Ruiting Li,Huiyan Wang,Yuantao Han,Cangyi Yang,jiaxu Zhang,Feiliang Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LTA-Thinker is a novel framework that improves complex reasoning in LLMs by enhancing Latent Thought variance through learnable priors and multi-objective optimization, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck in efficient generation and utilization of high-quality Latent Thoughts for complex reasoning, as larger variance in Latent Thought distribution better approximates the golden truth distribution.

Method: Proposes LTA-Thinker with two key components: 1) Learnable prior architecture to increase Latent Thought variance, and 2) Distribution-based directional optimization with Semantic Alignment Loss (KL divergence) and Reasoning Focus Loss (contrastive learning) combined with SFT.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among various baselines, demonstrating higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.

Conclusion: LTA-Thinker effectively enhances reasoning performance by improving Latent Thought distribution variance through innovative architectural and optimization approaches.

Abstract: Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut,
SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the
core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of
high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger
variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates
the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training
Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances
reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a
Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This
architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent
Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the
performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based
directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution
locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency
and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which
combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses:
Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent
Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus
Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to
focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and
demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.

Motivation: To test whether LLMs can generate realistic random street addresses, which requires understanding of geographic patterns and local conventions.

Method: Evaluating LLMs on their ability to generate random street addresses for European cities, assessing the realism and randomness of the outputs.

Result: LLMs perform poorly at generating random street addresses, indicating limitations in their understanding of geographic and local contextual patterns.

Conclusion: While LLMs excel at many complex tasks, they have specific weaknesses in generating realistic random addresses, highlighting areas for improvement in spatial and local knowledge.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Deep learning approach using satellite imagery and DEM data to estimate urban population with high accuracy (F1-score 0.9936), achieving automated population estimation of 278,954 for Gandhinagar.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional population estimation methods like surveys and censuses are expensive, time-consuming, and resource-intensive, requiring better automated solutions for urban planning and resource allocation.

Method: Combines CNN for building classification (residential vs non-residential) and ANN for population estimation, using high-resolution satellite imagery (0.3m), DEM data (0.5m), and vector boundaries on ~48k building footprints.

Result: Achieved impressive overall F1-score of 0.9936 and estimated Gandhinagar population at 278,954, demonstrating high accuracy and effectiveness on large-scale dataset.

Conclusion: The framework provides municipalities with a scalable, replicable tool for optimized resource management, showcasing AI-driven geospatial analytics' efficiency in enhancing data-driven urban governance.

Abstract: Population estimation is crucial for various applications, from resource
allocation to urban planning. Traditional methods such as surveys and censuses
are expensive, time-consuming and also heavily dependent on human resources,
requiring significant manpower for data collection and processing. In this
study a deep learning solution is proposed to estimate population using high
resolution (0.3 m) satellite imagery, Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of 0.5m
resolution and vector boundaries. Proposed method combines Convolution Neural
Network (CNN) architecture for classification task to classify buildings as
residential and non-residential and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
architecture to estimate the population. Approx. 48k building footprints over
Gandhinagar urban area are utilized containing both residential and
non-residential, with residential categories further used for building-level
population estimation. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving an impressive overall
F1-score of 0.9936. The proposed system employs advanced geospatial analysis
with high spatial resolution to estimate Gandhinagar population at 278,954. By
integrating real-time data updates, standardized metrics, and infrastructure
planning capabilities, this automated approach addresses critical limitations
of conventional census-based methodologies. The framework provides
municipalities with a scalable and replicable tool for optimized resource
management in rapidly urbanizing cities, showcasing the efficiency of AI-driven
geospatial analytics in enhancing data-driven urban governance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HLSMAC is a new StarCraft II benchmark with 12 scenarios based on classical stratagems, designed to evaluate high-level strategic decision-making in MARL beyond micromanagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on micromanagement and lack comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic intelligence, limiting the assessment of agents' strategic decision-making capabilities.

Method: Developed 12 StarCraft II scenarios based on the Thirty-Six Stratagems, each challenging agents with strategic elements like tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception. Proposed novel metrics beyond win rate including ability utilization and advancement efficiency.

Result: Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents demonstrated that HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for evaluating multi-agent strategic decision-making capabilities.

Conclusion: HLSMAC successfully addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks by providing a comprehensive framework for assessing high-level strategic intelligence in cooperative MARL, opening new avenues for evaluating strategic decision-making capabilities.

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven
significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on
micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic
intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL
benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical
stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a
specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic
elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,
thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making
capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond
conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency,
to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We
integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our
benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that
HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic
decision-making.

### [185] [The Anatomy of Alignment: Decomposing Preference Optimization by Steering Sparse Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12934)
*Jeremias Ferrao,Matthijs van der Lende,Ilija Lichkovski,Clement Neo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FSRL is a transparent alignment framework that uses lightweight adapters to steer LLM behavior through interpretable features from Sparse Autoencoders, achieving comparable performance to RLHF while providing mechanistic insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLHF methods induce opaque parameter changes, making it difficult to understand what models internalize during alignment. There's a need for more transparent and interpretable alignment approaches.

Method: Feature Steering with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL) trains lightweight adapters to modulate interpretable features from Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to steer model behavior.

Result: FSRL is comparable to current RLHF methods for preference optimization. Mechanistic analysis reveals the adapter systematically promotes style features over explicit alignment concepts, suggesting preference optimization rewards stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality.

Conclusion: FSRL provides a tool for both interpretable model control and diagnosing the internal mechanisms of alignment, offering a more transparent alternative to traditional RLHF.

Abstract: Aligning large language models is critical for their usability and safety.
However, the prevailing approach of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) induces diffuse, opaque parameter changes, making it difficult to
discern what the model has internalized. Hence, we introduce Feature Steering
with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL), a transparent alignment framework that
trains a lightweight adapter to steer behavior by modulating interpretable
features from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). First, we demonstrate that FSRL is an
effective method for preference optimization and is comparable with current
RLHF methods. We then perform mechanistic analysis on the trained adapter, and
find that its policy systematically promotes style features over explicit
alignment concepts, suggesting that the preference optimization process rewards
stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality. Ultimately, we hope that FSRL
provides a tool for both interpretable model control and diagnosing the
internal mechanisms of alignment.

### [186] [Black-box Model Merging for Language-Model-as-a-Service with Massive Model Repositories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12951)
*Shilian Chen,Jie Zhou,Tianyu Huai,Yujiang Lu,Junsong Li,Bihao Zhan,Qianjun Pan,Yutao Yang,Xin Li,Qin Chen,Hang Yan,Liang He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Evo-Merging: A derivative-free optimization framework using evolutionary algorithms for black-box model merging of large language models via API queries only, without access to model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging approaches require access to model parameters, but large LLMs like GPT-4 are often provided as black-box services through APIs, making their weights unavailable to users. This creates the challenge of black-box model merging (BMM) with massive LLMs.

Method: Proposes Evo-Merging framework with two key components: (1) sparsity-based denoising to filter irrelevant/redundant information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling to dynamically compute optimal combination weights based on model performance. Uses evolutionary algorithm for derivative-free optimization via inference-time API queries only.

Result: Extensive experimental evaluations show the approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of tasks, significantly outperforming existing strong baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed Evo-Merging framework effectively addresses the black-box model merging challenge for massive LLMs, providing a practical solution that works with API-only access and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Model merging refers to the process of integrating multiple distinct models
into a unified model that preserves and combines the strengths and capabilities
of the individual models. Most existing approaches rely on task vectors to
combine models, typically under the assumption that model parameters are
accessible. However, for extremely large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4,
which are often provided solely as black-box services through API interfaces
(Language-Model-as-a-Service), model weights are not available to end users.
This presents a significant challenge, which we refer to as black-box model
merging (BMM) with massive LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a
derivative-free optimization framework based on the evolutionary algorithm
(Evo-Merging) that enables effective model merging using only inference-time
API queries. Our method consists of two key components: (1) sparsity-based
denoising, designed to identify and filter out irrelevant or redundant
information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling, which dynamically
computes optimal combination weights for the relevant models based on their
performance. We also provide a formal justification, along with a theoretical
analysis, for our asymmetric sparsification. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of
tasks, significantly outperforming existing strong baselines.

### [187] [Forget What's Sensitive, Remember What Matters: Token-Level Differential Privacy in Memory Sculpting for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12958)
*Bihao Zhan,Jie Zhou,Junsong Li,Yutao Yang,Shilian Chen,Qianjun Pan,Xin Li,Wen Wu,Xingjiao Wu,Qin Chen,Hang Yan,Liang He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PeCL framework combines token-level dynamic differential privacy and privacy-guided memory sculpting to protect sensitive data while preserving model utility in continual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional uniform DP approaches degrade model utility too much in continual learning scenarios, requiring adaptive privacy protection that distinguishes between sensitive and non-sensitive information.

Method: 1) Token-level dynamic DP that allocates privacy budgets based on semantic sensitivity of individual tokens 2) Privacy-guided memory sculpting module that forgets sensitive information while preserving task-invariant knowledge

Result: Superior balance between privacy preservation and model utility, outperforming baseline models with high accuracy on previous tasks while ensuring robust privacy protection.

Conclusion: The proposed PeCL framework effectively addresses privacy challenges in continual learning by adaptively protecting sensitive information while maintaining model performance through intelligent forgetting and remembering mechanisms.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) models, while adept at sequential knowledge
acquisition, face significant and often overlooked privacy challenges due to
accumulating diverse information. Traditional privacy methods, like a uniform
Differential Privacy (DP) budget, indiscriminately protect all data, leading to
substantial model utility degradation and hindering CL deployment in
privacy-sensitive areas. To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced
continual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers
what matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential
Privacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the
semantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for
private entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general
knowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This
module leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to
intelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and
parameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge
crucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that
PeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility,
outperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks
while ensuring robust privacy.

TL;DR: Planning Copilot integrates planning tools with LLMs via MCP protocol, enabling reliable long-horizon planning without domain-specific fine-tuning, outperforming both base LLMs and GPT-5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack reliable long-horizon planning capabilities despite being used as autonomous agents for complex tasks.

Method: Developed Planning Copilot chatbot that uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect LLMs with external planning tools for syntax checking, planner selection, plan validation, and execution simulation.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows Planning Copilot significantly outperforms base LLMs without planning tools and even outperforms GPT-5 despite using smaller LLMs.

Conclusion: Dedicated planning tools integrated via standards like MCP are effective for enabling LLMs to perform reliable planning tasks without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents
capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to
perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this
gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple
planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural
language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a
recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and
systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without
domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning
tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an
appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and
simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning
Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show
that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the
planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool
against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our
Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much
smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to
enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper tests the Anna Karenina Principle across different media types (novels, Wikipedia, research papers, movies) and finds that structural success patterns vary by medium, with failure taking diverse forms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically test the Anna Karenina Principle (AKP) - which suggests success requires meeting essential conditions while failure has diverse forms - across different textual media and examine whether structural patterns of success are consistent or medium-specific.

Method: Represent texts as sequences of functional blocks and analyze convergence in transition order and position across novels, online encyclopedias, research papers, and movies.

Result: Structural principles vary by medium: novels follow reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia combines AKP with ordered patterns, academic papers show reverse AKP in order but remain noisy in position, and movies diverge by genre.

Conclusion: Success depends on medium-specific structural constraints, while failure assumes different shapes across domains, demonstrating that the AKP pattern is not universal but varies according to the medium's characteristics.

Abstract: The Anna Karenina Principle (AKP) holds that success requires satisfying a
small set of essential conditions, whereas failure takes diverse forms. We test
AKP, its reverse, and two further patterns described as ordered and noisy
across novels, online encyclopedias, research papers, and movies. Texts are
represented as sequences of functional blocks, and convergence is assessed in
transition order and position. Results show that structural principles vary by
medium: novels follow reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia combines AKP with ordered
patterns, academic papers display reverse AKP in order but remain noisy in
position, and movies diverge by genre. Success therefore depends on structural
constraints that are specific to each medium, while failure assumes different
shapes across domains.

Conclusion: MiniAgentPro provides a valuable visualization and testing framework for LLM-based agent societies, successfully addressing gaps in event organization evaluation and physical environment integration while revealing areas for improvement in complex coordination tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the simulation of agent
societies, enabling autonomous planning, memory formation, and social
interactions. However, existing frameworks often overlook systematic

*Marylou Fauchard,Florian Carichon,Margarida Carvalho,Golnoosh Farnadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with matching problems requiring preferential constraints, despite advances in reasoning techniques. A new benchmark for College Admission Problems shows reasoning LLMs outperform traditional models, but no prompt strategy consistently works best and iterative prompting performance is non-monotonic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show strong performance on mathematical tasks, their application to matching problems with preferential and structural constraints remains underexplored. The researchers aim to evaluate LLM performance on canonical matching problems.

Method: Created a benchmark of 369 College Admission Problem instances to evaluate LLMs on feasibility, stability, and optimality. Tested multiple open-weight LLMs using various prompting strategies including Chain-of-Thought, In-Context Learning, and role-based prompting.

Result: LLMs struggle to consistently meet all evaluation criteria. Reasoning LLMs (QwQ, GPT-oss) significantly outperform traditional models (Llama, Qwen, Mistral). Performance varies with prompting strategies, with no consistently best prompt. Iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback shows non-monotonic performance that can peak early then decline.

Conclusion: This work provides new insights into LLM reasoning performance and prompting effectiveness for combinatorial optimization with preferential constraints, highlighting both capabilities and limitations of current models.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including
combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context
Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and
accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However,
applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential
and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,
a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs
across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this
benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results
first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to
meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,
like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as
Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated
reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to
the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,
In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently
offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from
iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not
monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later
attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning
performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial
optimization problems with preferential constraints.

Motivation: Rising costs and complexity of financial crime compliance without measurable effectiveness improvements, coupled with opaque AI solutions that lack regulatory alignment.

Method: Action Design Research (ADR) process with fintech firm and regulatory stakeholders, using artifact-centric modeling to assign bounded roles to autonomous agents with task-specific model routing and audit logging.

Result: Developed a reference architecture and real-world prototype demonstrating how agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows while maintaining transparency and compliance under regulatory constraints.

Conclusion: Agentic AI embedded within accountable governance structures can support transparency and institutional trust in high-stakes regulated environments, extending IS literature on AI-enabled compliance.

Abstract: The cost and complexity of financial crime compliance (FCC) continue to rise,

Using artifact-centric modeling, it assigns clearly bounded roles to autonomous
agents and enables task-specific model routing and audit logging. The
contribution includes a reference architecture, a real-world prototype, and
insights into how Agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows under regulatory
constraints. Our findings extend IS literature on AI-enabled compliance by
demonstrating how automation, when embedded within accountable governance
structures, can support transparency and institutional trust in high-stakes,

### [193] [G-CSEA: A Graph-Based Conflict Set Extraction Algorithm for Identifying Infeasibility in Pseudo-Boolean Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13203)
*Kanishk Garg,Saranya D.,Sanal Kumar,Saurabh Singh,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes G-CSEA, a graph-based algorithm for extracting conflict sets in workforce scheduling models with pseudo-Boolean constraints, addressing limitations of existing IIS extraction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for identifying infeasibility causes in workforce scheduling models (Additive Deletion, QuickXplain) require many solver calls, while dual ray analysis fails for pseudo-Boolean models when the relaxed problem is feasible.

Method: Developed Graph-based Conflict Set Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA) that constructs implication graphs during constraint propagation and traces contributing constraints across decision branches upon conflict detection, optionally minimized with QuickXplain.

Result: The proposed method provides an efficient way to extract conflict sets and Irreducible Infeasible Subsets (IISs) for pseudo-Boolean constraint models used in workforce scheduling.

Conclusion: G-CSEA offers a more effective approach for diagnosing infeasibility in workforce scheduling problems by leveraging graph-based analysis inspired by CDCL SAT solvers, overcoming limitations of traditional IIS extraction methods.

Abstract: Workforce scheduling involves a variety of rule-based constraints-such as
shift limits, staffing policies, working hour restrictions, and many similar
scheduling rules-which can interact in conflicting ways, leading to infeasible
models. Identifying the underlying causes of such infeasibility is critical for
resolving scheduling issues and restoring feasibility. A common diagnostic
approach is to compute Irreducible Infeasible Subsets (IISs): minimal sets of
constraints that are jointly infeasible but become feasible when any one is
removed. We consider models formulated using pseudo-Boolean constraints with
inequality relations over binary variables, which naturally encode scheduling
logic. Existing IIS extraction methods such as Additive Deletion and
QuickXplain rely on repeated feasibility checks, often incurring large numbers
of solver calls. Dual ray analysis, while effective for LP-based models, may
fail when the relaxed problem is feasible but the underlying pseudo-Boolean
model is not. To address these limitations, we propose Graph-based Conflict Set
Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA) to extract a conflict set, an approach inspired
by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) in SAT solvers. Our method constructs
an implication graph during constraint propagation and, upon detecting a
conflict, traces all contributing constraints across both decision branches.
The resulting conflict set can optionally be minimized using QuickXplain to
produce an IIS.

### [194] [Simulating Clinical AI Assistance using Multimodal LLMs: A Case Study in Diabetic Retinopathy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13234)
*Nadim Barakat,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Researchers evaluated multimodal LLMs (GPT-4o and MedGemma) for diabetic retinopathy detection, finding MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o in baseline performance but GPT-4o achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's outputs, suggesting MLLMs can improve DR screening and serve as simulators for studying clinical AI assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FDA-cleared diabetic retinopathy screening systems provide only binary referral outputs, which may limit clinical trust and utility. There's a need to determine the most effective output format to enhance clinician-AI performance, but this is difficult to assess at scale.

Method: Evaluated two MLLMs (GPT-4o and MedGemma) on IDRiD and Messidor-2 datasets through: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs.

Result: MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at baseline with higher sensitivity and AUROC. GPT-4o showed near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. In collaboration, GPT-4o achieved AUROC up to 0.96 when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even without direct image access.

Conclusion: MLLMs may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for studying clinical AI assistance. Open models like MedGemma are valuable in low-resource settings, and descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician trust.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI
systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared
systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output
may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective
output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge
that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI
assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and
Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source
medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI
assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration
where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at
baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed
near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions
based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect
ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o
achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even
without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs
may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for
studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open,
lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource
settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician
trust in clinical workflows.

TL;DR: Proposes COLMA, a cognitive layered memory architecture for AGI systems that addresses limitations in adaptability, multimodal integration, and continuous learning through scenario-driven design principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI memory systems lack robustness, human-like capabilities, and suffer from limited adaptability, insufficient multimodal integration, and inability to support continuous learning - critical gaps for advancing toward AGI.

Method: Scenario-driven methodology that extracts functional requirements from cognitive scenarios to establish design principles, resulting in the COgnitive Layered Memory Architecture (COLMA) framework.

Result: Development of COLMA as a unified framework integrating cognitive scenarios, memory processes, and storage mechanisms into a cohesive design for next-generation AI memory systems.

Conclusion: COLMA provides a structured foundation for AI systems capable of lifelong learning and human-like reasoning, contributing to the pragmatic development of artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence advances toward artificial general intelligence
(AGI), the need for robust and human-like memory systems has become
increasingly evident. Current memory architectures often suffer from limited
adaptability, insufficient multimodal integration, and an inability to support
continuous learning. To address these limitations, we propose a scenario-driven
methodology that extracts essential functional requirements from representative
cognitive scenarios, leading to a unified set of design principles for
next-generation AI memory systems. Based on this approach, we introduce the
\textbf{COgnitive Layered Memory Architecture (COLMA)}, a novel framework that
integrates cognitive scenarios, memory processes, and storage mechanisms into a
cohesive design. COLMA provides a structured foundation for developing AI
systems capable of lifelong learning and human-like reasoning, thereby
contributing to the pragmatic development of AGI.

### [196] [RepIt: Representing Isolated Targets to Steer Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13281)
*Vincent Siu,Nathan W. Henry,Nicholas Crispino,Yang Liu,Dawn Song,Chenguang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RepIt is a simple, data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific representations in LLMs, enabling precise interventions that can selectively suppress refusal on targeted concepts while preserving safety elsewhere.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current activation steering methods in LLMs often have broader effects than desired, motivating the need for purer concept vectors to enable more targeted interventions and granular understanding of LLM behavior.

Method: RepIt framework for isolating concept-specific representations, using corrective signals that localize to just 100-200 neurons and can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a single A6000 GPU.

Result: Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise interventions that selectively suppress refusal on targeted concepts (like WMD-related questions) while preserving refusal elsewhere, maintaining safety on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Targeted interventions can counteract overgeneralization in LLMs, laying foundation for more granular control, but efficiency raises dual-use concerns as manipulations can be performed with modest compute and data to evade existing benchmarks.

Abstract: While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area
of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This
motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions
and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a
simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific
representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise
interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while
preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related
questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show
that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust
target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a
single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be
performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented
data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal
vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can
counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control
of model behavior.

### [197] [Shapes of Cognition for Computational Cognitive Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13288)
*Marjorie McShane,Sergei Nirenburg,Sanjay Oruganti,Jesse English*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Shapes of cognition is a new paradigm for modeling Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents using remembered knowledge constellations that enable efficient pattern recognition, habitual action, and cognitive load minimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a computational cognitive modeling approach that allows agents to handle real-life complexity through typical expectations, pattern recognition, and minimal cognitive effort, while providing explainable and trustworthy systems for critical domains.

Method: Shapes-based modeling involves specific objectives, hypotheses, strategies, knowledge bases, and models implemented within a cognitive architecture, using remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and procedural knowledge.

Result: The approach enables agents to expect typical outcomes, recognize patterns, act by habit, reason by analogy, and minimize cognitive load, with recovery methods for atypical situations like on-the-fly learning or human assistance.

Conclusion: Shapes-based modeling provides a specific yet broadly applicable framework that revitalizes knowledge-based and hybrid AI approaches, enabling the creation of explainable, extensible, and trustworthy agent systems.

Abstract: Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for the computational
cognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are
remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and
procedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real
life the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing
patterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally
minimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes
are treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly,
asking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect,
situational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not
vague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses,
modeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging
phenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such
specificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical
aims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and
worthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA
example of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied
more broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.
