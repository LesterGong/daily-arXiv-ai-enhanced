### [2] [Oracle-RLAIF: An Improved Fine-Tuning Framework for Multi-modal Video Models through Reinforcement Learning from Ranking Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02561)
*Derek Shi,Ruben Glatt,Christine Klymko,Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shashank Kushwaha,Sam Sakla,Felipe Leno da Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Oracle-RLAIF is a novel framework that replaces expensive trained reward models with a general Oracle ranker for video-language models, using rank-based optimization instead of scalar scoring to make reinforcement learning from AI feedback more cost-effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLAIF frameworks for video-language models require expensive specialized reward models trained with video narratives, making fine-tuning costly and restrictive as models scale up in parameter size.

Method: Proposes Oracle-RLAIF framework using a general Oracle ranker to rank candidate responses instead of scoring them, and introduces GRPO_rank - a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy Optimization that optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware advantages.

Result: Oracle-RLAIF consistently outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods across various video comprehension benchmarks.

Conclusion: Oracle-RLAIF enables flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal video models using reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

Abstract: Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive
fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual
comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video
comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of
gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,
recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),
which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks
rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create
calibrated scalar rewards -- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose
Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a
more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate
model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce
$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware
advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently
outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated
across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to
creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal
video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

### [3] [PhysHMR: Learning Humanoid Control Policies from Vision for Physically Plausible Human Motion Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02566)
*Qiao Feng,Yiming Huang,Yufu Wang,Jiatao Gu,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysHMR is a unified framework that learns a visual-to-action policy for physically plausible human motion reconstruction from monocular videos, avoiding the error accumulation of traditional two-stage methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use kinematics-based pose estimation followed by physics post-processing, which causes error accumulation and unrealistic results due to lack of physical constraints.

Method: Uses pixel-as-ray strategy to lift 2D keypoints into 3D spatial rays for global pose guidance, combines with local visual features, and employs distillation from mocap-trained expert with reinforcement learning refinement.

Result: Produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios, outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

Conclusion: PhysHMR successfully integrates physical constraints directly into motion reconstruction, achieving superior results compared to traditional two-stage methods.

Abstract: Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos
remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods
primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to
unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such
artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing
following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this
two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework
that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a
physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically
grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our
approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial
rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as
policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy
3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual
features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both
detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of
reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that
transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the
vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated
reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR
produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,
outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

### [4] [Unlocking the power of partnership: How humans and machines can work together to improve face recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02570)
*P. Jonathon Phillips,Geraldine Jeckeln,Carina A. Hahn,Amy N. Yates,Peter C. Fontana,Alice J. O'Toole*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Human-machine collaboration in face identification improves accuracy when following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR), with intelligent fusion outperforming both solo machine operation and indiscriminate human-machine combinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine when combining human and machine decisions in face identification actually improves accuracy, given individual differences between people and algorithms.

Method: Used data from expert and non-expert face identifiers to examine human-human and human-machine collaborations, established the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR), implemented intelligent human-machine fusion by selecting people who could improve machine accuracy, and used graph theory to analyze human-only partnerships.

Result: Collaboration benefits increased as baseline accuracy differences between collaborators decreased. A surprisingly large critical fusion zone was identified where humans are less accurate than machines but fusion improves system accuracy. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than machines alone and outperformed combining all human-machine judgments.

Conclusion: Both humans and machines play meaningful roles in accurate face identification. The study provides an evidence-based roadmap for intelligent AI use in face identification systems, with intelligent human-machine collaboration effectively minimizing the impact of low-performing humans.

Abstract: Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms
creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between
people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades
accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which
combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.
Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the
benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of
collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between
collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule
predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline
abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using
the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate
than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was
surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by
selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a
high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine
operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine
judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only
partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated
the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration.
However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the
impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results
demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate
face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the
intelligent use of AI in face identification.

### [5] [How Confident are Video Models? Empowering Video Models to Express their Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02571)
*Zhiting Mei,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First framework for uncertainty quantification in generative video models, addressing hallucination risks through calibration metrics and uncertainty decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generation models hallucinate like LLMs but lack uncertainty quantification methods, raising safety concerns for real-world applications.

Method: Proposes S-QUBED framework with: calibration metric using robust rank correlation, black-box UQ method decomposing uncertainty into aleatoric/epistemic components via latent modeling, and dedicated UQ dataset.

Result: S-QUBED computes calibrated uncertainty estimates negatively correlated with task accuracy and effectively separates aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty components.

Conclusion: First successful uncertainty quantification framework for video models that addresses critical safety gaps and enables reliable uncertainty decomposition.

Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,
spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like
large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,
producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although
uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior
work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the
uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty
quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for
evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation
estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method
for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to
rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic
components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in
video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we
disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that
arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total
uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and
effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

### [6] [PEO: Training-Free Aesthetic Quality Enhancement in Pre-Trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Prompt Embedding Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02599)
*Hovhannes Margaryan,Bo Wan,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO) is a training-free method that improves aesthetic quality in text-to-image diffusion models by optimizing text embeddings of simple prompts using a tripartite objective function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the visual quality of images generated from simple, uncurated prompts in pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models without requiring additional training.

Method: PEO optimizes text embeddings using a tripartite objective function that improves aesthetic fidelity, ensures adherence to optimized embeddings, and minimizes divergence from initial prompts through a prompt preservation term.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show PEO exceeds or equals state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt adaptation methods in performance.

Conclusion: PEO effectively improves aesthetic quality in diffusion models through prompt embedding optimization while being training-free and backbone-independent.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our
method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of
a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the
generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that
improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to
the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt.
The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally,
PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or
equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt
adaptation methods.

### [7] [Ego-Exo 3D Hand Tracking in the Wild with a Mobile Multi-Camera Rig](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02601)
*Patrick Rim,Kun He,Kevin Harris,Braden Copple,Shangchen Han,Sizhe An,Ivan Shugurov,Tomas Hodan,He Wen,Xu Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel marker-less multi-camera system for accurate 3D hand tracking in unconstrained settings, combining exocentric and egocentric views to bridge the gap between environmental realism and annotation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for 3D hand tracking are mostly captured in controlled lab environments, limiting environmental diversity and model generalization for real-world applications.

Method: Developed a lightweight back-mounted capture rig with 8 exocentric cameras and a Meta Quest 3 headset providing 2 egocentric views, plus an ego-exo tracking pipeline for generating accurate 3D hand pose ground truth.

Result: Created an annotated dataset with synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand poses, demonstrating significant reduction in the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed system enables nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions while maintaining precise 3D hand tracking capabilities.

Abstract: Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in
unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer
vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in
controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model
generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera
system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for
nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a
lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a
user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We
design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground
truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an
annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand
poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce
the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

### [8] [Input-Aware Sparse Attention for Real-Time Co-Speech Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02617)
*Beijia Lu,Ziyi Chen,Jing Xiao,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a distillation method to accelerate diffusion-based co-speech video generation from audio, achieving real-time performance while maintaining visual quality through input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods for co-speech video generation are too slow for real-time deployment due to numerous denoising steps and costly attention mechanisms.

Method: Distills many-step diffusion video model into few-step student model using input human pose conditioning for attention and loss functions. Proposes input-aware sparse attention guided by pose keypoints and input-aware distillation loss for improved lip sync and hand motion.

Result: Achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods, with better inference efficiency and motion coherence.

Conclusion: The proposed input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss effectively enable real-time co-speech video generation while maintaining high visual quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for
various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However,
existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and
costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we
distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.
Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades
video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these
issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose
conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using
accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention
to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This
input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens
temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and
motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an
input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion
realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,
our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared
to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive
experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

### [9] [Deep Generative Continual Learning using Functional LoRA: FunLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02631)
*Victor Enescu,Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FunLoRA: A novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method using functional LoRA with rank 1 matrices to prevent catastrophic forgetting in continual learning of generative models, achieving better performance with lower memory and time costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in continual adaptation of deep generative models, overcoming limitations of existing approaches like increasing training time and performance degradation from synthetic data reliance.

Method: Design expressive conditioning mechanism using low rank adaptation (LoRA) with exclusively rank 1 matrices, functionally increasing matrix rank through carefully selected functions (FunLoRA). The model is trained only on current task data.

Result: Surpasses prior state-of-the-art diffusion model results, achieving higher classification accuracy while requiring only a fraction of memory cost and sampling time in flow-matching based models.

Conclusion: FunLoRA provides an effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for continual learning that avoids catastrophic forgetting and outperforms existing methods in both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and
critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision
based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging
due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural
networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists
in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to
mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the
continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)
reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance
degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.
In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more
expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank
adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose
reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected
functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic
conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.
Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,
showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching
higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the
memory cost and sampling time.

### [10] [Sequence-Preserving Dual-FoV Defense for Traffic Sign and Light Recognition in Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02642)
*Abhishek Joshi,Jahnavi Krishna Koda,Abhishek Phadke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual FoV, sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic light and sign recognition that addresses temporal continuity and multistatic sensing vulnerabilities to both digital and natural perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic light and sign recognition is critical for AV safety, but current models lack temporal continuity, multistatic FoV sensing, and robustness to both digital attacks and natural degradation like glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti.

Method: Proposes a unified three-layer defense stack with feature squeezing, defensive distillation, entropy-based anomaly detection, and sequence-wise temporal voting. Uses multi-source dataset from aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and self-recorded Texas videos across four ODDs: highway, night, rainy, and urban.

Result: Achieved 79.8mAP, reduced attack success rate to 18.2%, and reduced high-risk misclassification to 32%, outperforming YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and BEVFormer.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides superior robustness for traffic light and sign recognition in AVs by addressing temporal and multistatic sensing vulnerabilities while maintaining high performance across various operational domains.

Abstract: Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In
addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing
perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous
misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal
continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both
digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,
sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the
USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and
self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of
RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):
highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life
application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer
defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive
distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise
temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included
accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,
and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes
for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved
79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and
BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.

### [11] [Smart-GRPO: Smartly Sampling Noise for Efficient RL of Flow-Matching Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02654)
*Benjamin Yu,Jackie Liu,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smart-GRPO is a method that optimizes noise perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models, enabling more efficient and stable training compared to random noise approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-matching models are deterministic and poorly suited for reinforcement learning, which is crucial for improving image quality and human alignment. Existing methods using random noise perturbations are inefficient and unstable.

Method: Smart-GRPO uses an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations, evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution toward higher-reward regions.

Result: Experiments show Smart-GRPO improves both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Smart-GRPO provides a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image
generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes
them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image
quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by
perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient
and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise
perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO
employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,
evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution
toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves
both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our
results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching
frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned
generation.

*Yibin Zhao,Yihan Pan,Jun Nan,Jianjun Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSFSplatter enables fast surface reconstruction from free sparse images using dense Gaussian initialization and geometry-enhanced optimization, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian Splatting methods require dense, calibrated views and perform poorly with sparse images due to limited overlap and overfitting.

Method: Integrates end-to-end dense Gaussian initialization using a large Transformer, self-splitting Gaussian head, contribution-based pruning, and depth/multi-view feature supervision with differentiable camera parameters.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on DTU and Replica datasets.

Conclusion: FSFSplatter effectively addresses sparse image reconstruction challenges through integrated initialization and optimization techniques.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

### [13] [MoGIC: Boosting Motion Generation via Intention Understanding and Visual Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02722)
*Junyu Shi,Yong Sun,Zhiyuan Zhang,Lijiang Liu,Zhengjie Zhang,Yuxin He,Qiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGIC is a unified framework that integrates intention modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis, addressing limitations in existing text-driven motion generation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat motion generation as bidirectional language-motion mapping but fail to capture causal logic of action execution and human intentions, with language alone being insufficient for fine-grained spatiotemporal details.

Method: Jointly optimizes multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction, uses mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope for local alignment, and leverages visual priors. Curated Mo440H benchmark from 21 datasets.

Result: Reduces FID by 38.6% on HumanML3D and 34.6% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based methods in motion captioning, enables intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation.

Conclusion: MoGIC advances controllable motion synthesis and intention understanding by integrating intention modeling and visual priors into a unified multimodal framework.

Abstract: Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a
bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in
capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that
drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and
personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal
details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention
modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly
optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,
MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance
generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further
introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable
effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.
To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21
high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC
reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based
methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables
intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable
motion synthesis and intention understanding. The code is available at

### [14] [From Tokens to Nodes: Semantic-Guided Motion Control for Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02732)
*Jianing Chen,Zehao Li,Yujun Cai,Hao Jiang,Shuqin Gao,Honglong Zhao,Tianlu Mao,Yucheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A motion-adaptive 3D reconstruction framework that dynamically allocates control points based on motion complexity using semantic and motion priors, replacing static geometric allocation with adaptive compression and spline-based trajectory parameterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse control methods for dynamic 3D reconstruction suffer from inefficient control point allocation - they use purely geometric criteria leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency, failing to align control density with actual motion complexity.

Method: Uses semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models to establish patch-token-node correspondences, applies motion-adaptive compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions, and employs iterative voxelization with motion tendency scoring. Replaces MLP-based deformation fields with spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over state-of-the-art methods, with smoother motion representation and more stable optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed motion-adaptive framework successfully addresses the fundamental mismatch between control point allocation and motion complexity, enabling more efficient and higher-quality dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos.

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the
ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Net2Net combines untrained and pre-trained networks using regularization by denoising (RED) for real-world noise removal, achieving superior performance without requiring extensive labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional denoising methods struggle with real noise complexity, while deep learning approaches require extensive labeled data and may not generalize well across diverse noise types and imaging conditions.

Method: Hybrid framework combining unsupervised Deep Image Prior (DIP) with supervised pre-trained DRUNet model using regularization by denoising (RED), where untrained network adapts to input-specific noise and pre-trained network provides robust learned representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance for real-world noise removal, particularly in scenarios with limited training data.

Conclusion: Net2Net effectively addresses real-world denoising challenges by leveraging both unsupervised adaptation and supervised pre-training, enhancing generalization across varying noise patterns.

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on
handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle
to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise
characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require
extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise
types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,
termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained
networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation
of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised
pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained
network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without
requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned
representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising
performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise
patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

*Lanyun Zhu,Deyi Ji,Tianrun Chen,Haiyang Wu,Shiqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Retrv-R1 is the first R1-style MLLM for multimodal universal retrieval, using step-by-step reasoning and novel compression/training methods to achieve SOTA performance with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of DeepSeek-R1 methods to retrieval tasks is infeasible due to high computational costs from large token consumption and instability when applying RL to retrieval training.

Method: Introduces information compression module with details inspection mechanism to reduce tokens while preserving critical information, and a new training paradigm with activation stage using retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset followed by RL with curriculum reward.

Result: Retrv-R1 achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully address computational efficiency and training stability issues, enabling effective application of RL-enhanced reasoning to multimodal retrieval tasks.

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper
introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for
multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing
step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that
directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not
feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large
token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,
and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to
train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an
information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which
enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while
ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.
Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage
using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective
optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both
performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1
achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,
as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

### [17] [Bayesian Test-time Adaptation for Object Recognition and Detection with Vision-language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02750)
*Lihua Zhou,Mao Ye,Shuaifeng Li,Nianxin Li,Jinlin Wu,Xiatian Zhu,Lei Deng,Hongbin Liu,Jiebo Luo,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BCA+ is a training-free test-time adaptation framework for vision-language models that uses Bayesian inference with dynamic cache updates to handle distribution shifts in object recognition and detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptation methods either rely on computationally expensive backpropagation or focus only on likelihood adaptation, ignoring the important role of prior distributions in handling real-world distribution shifts.

Method: BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection), and adaptive class priors from historical predictions. It formulates adaptation as Bayesian inference, fusing initial VLM outputs with cache-based predictions that combine dynamically updated likelihoods and priors.

Result: BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition and detection benchmarks while being highly efficient as a training-free method requiring no backpropagation.

Conclusion: BCA+ provides a unified, efficient framework for test-time adaptation that corrects both semantic understanding and contextual confidence through dual-adaptation mechanism and uncertainty-guided fusion.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved
remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their
performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time
adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during
inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive
backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on
likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our
prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for
object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates
adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class
Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both
object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that
adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),
and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We
formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions
are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.
This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood
(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving
class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with
uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic
understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method
requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition
and detection benchmarks.

*Matthias Perkonigg,Patrick Rockenschaub,Georg Göbel,Adelheid Wöhrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HGCD-BT is a novel hierarchical generalized category discovery method for brain tumor classification that integrates hierarchical clustering with contrastive learning to identify both known and unknown tumor types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing brain tumor classification methods are limited to predefined classes and cannot handle previously unseen tumor types, while unsupervised learning lacks prior knowledge from labeled data.

Method: Extends contrastive learning based GCD by incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss to capture the hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies.

Result: Achieves +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for patch-level classification on OpenSRH dataset, particularly in identifying unseen tumor categories, and demonstrates generalizability on slide-level classification from Digital Brain Tumor Atlas.

Conclusion: HGCD-BT effectively bridges the gap between supervised and unsupervised learning for brain tumor classification, enabling identification of both known and unknown tumor types across different imaging modalities.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision
making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are
restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to
capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised
learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to
incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods
often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data.
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing
both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the
hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce
Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification
(HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with
contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by
incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate
HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,
achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for
patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor
categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on
slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images
from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging
modalities.

*Xian Zhang,Zexi Wu,Zinuo Li,Hongming Xu,Luqi Gong,Farid Boussaid,Naoufel Werghi,Mohammed Bennamoun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaRD-Key is a training-free keyframe sampling module for long-form video understanding that maximizes a unified Relevance-Diversity objective to select informative yet non-redundant frames, with adaptive gating for weak alignment scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with long-form videos due to uniform sampling missing critical moments, while existing keyframe selection methods either impose rigid temporal spacing that misses fine-grained cues or emphasize diversity but neglect query relevance.

Method: Proposes AdaRD-Key that maximizes a unified Relevance-Diversity Max-Volume objective combining query-conditioned relevance scores with log-determinant diversity. Uses lightweight relevance-aware gating to shift to diversity-only mode when weak alignment is detected.

Result: Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form videos. The method is training-free, computationally efficient (real-time on single GPU), and plug-and-play compatible with existing VLMs.

Conclusion: AdaRD-Key effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches for long-form video understanding by balancing relevance and diversity through an adaptive, training-free framework that achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for
vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high
information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely
on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to
incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches
impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window
suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at
limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near
important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect
query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module
for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified
Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a
query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to
yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak
alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating
mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method
seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without
additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally
efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing
VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and
Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form
videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.

*Prahitha Movva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) approach rebus puzzles through explainability analysis, revealing systematic strengths in visual composition but limitations in absence interpretation and cultural symbolism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with complex lateral thinking challenges like rebus puzzles, but the underlying reasoning processes and failure patterns remain unexplored despite recent work showing poor performance.

Method: Created a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles across six cognitive categories, with an evaluation framework separating reasoning quality from answer correctness, and investigated three prompting strategies to elicit different explanatory processes.

Result: Reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural symbolism. Prompting strategy substantially influences both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness.

Conclusion: Explainability should be an integral component of model performance evaluation rather than a post-hoc consideration, as it reveals critical insights into VLM cognitive processes and systematic failure patterns.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their
cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like
rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle
significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and
failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a
comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to
understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our
study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles
across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that
separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three
prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory
processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our
findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle
categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition
while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural
symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences
both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing
explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a
post-hoc consideration.

*Jan Zdenek,Wataru Shimoda,Kota Yamaguchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new synthetic dataset for text removal that addresses limitations in existing benchmarks by using complex backgrounds, object-aware text placement, and vision-language generated content to improve generalization and evaluation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text removal datasets like SCUT-EnsText have limitations including ground truth artifacts from manual editing, simplistic backgrounds, and inadequate evaluation metrics that don't properly assess result quality. These issues hinder out-of-domain generalization and accurate performance evaluation.

Method: The authors developed a synthetic dataset generation approach that renders text on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and vision-language model-generated content. This ensures clean ground truth and creates challenging text removal scenarios across various domains beyond just scene text.

Result: The resulting dataset provides challenging text removal scenarios with clean ground truth, addressing the artifacts and simplicity issues of existing benchmarks. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/cyberagent/OTR.

Conclusion: The proposed synthetic benchmark overcomes key limitations of existing text removal datasets by providing clean ground truth, complex backgrounds, and better evaluation scenarios, enabling more accurate assessment of text removal methods across multiple domains.

Abstract: Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as
privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research
has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in
current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In
particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground
truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and
evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To
address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal
benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features
text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and
vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and
challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at

*Ara Seo,Bryan Sangwoo Kim,Hyungjin Chung,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for aligning DETR-style object queries with modality context to improve medical object detection across mixed modalities (CXR, CT, MRI) without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical object detection suffers when trained on mixed modalities due to heterogeneous statistics and disjoint representation spaces, requiring representation alignment.

Method: Proposes modality tokens (text-derived embeddings) integrated via Multimodality Context Attention (MoCA) and QueryREPA pretraining with contrastive objective to align queries with modality context.

Result: Consistently improves AP across diverse modalities with minimal overhead and no architectural modifications.

Conclusion: Offers a practical path toward robust multimodality medical object detection through modality-aware, class-faithful queries.

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed
medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and
disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to
representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing
features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target
the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,
detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we
define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging
modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate
the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context
Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to
propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style
architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into
object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that
aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific
contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and
QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer
effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained
altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal
overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward
robust multimodality medical object detection. Project page:

*Jingyuan Deng,Yujiu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaskCD is a method that uses image head masking in LVLMs to create contrastive samples for decoding, effectively reducing hallucinations while preserving model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for addressing hallucinations in LVLMs have limitations - contrastive decoding struggles with sample construction and attention manipulation lacks stability.

Method: Proposes Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD) that masks "image heads" in LVLMs to construct contrastive samples for contrastive decoding.

Result: Evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-7b and Qwen-VL-7b using benchmarks like CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME, showing effective hallucination reduction while maintaining general capabilities.

Conclusion: MaskCD successfully alleviates hallucinations in LVLMs and retains their general capabilities, providing a more stable approach compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their
capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those
problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for
the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual
and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,
such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive
decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and
attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this
work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach
utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive
samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and
Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The
results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of
hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding

TL;DR: VERNIER is an open-source phase processing software for nanometric pose estimation using pseudo-periodic patterns, providing robust performance against noise, defocus, and occlusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose estimation at small scales remains challenging, with few solutions achieving nanometric and microradian resolutions over large ranges for microscopy applications.

Method: Uses phase-based local thresholding algorithm with pseudo-periodic patterns, including pattern encoding methods for centimeter ranges and phase processing of periodic frames for nanometer resolutions.

Result: The software provides fast and reliable pose measurement, proven robust to noise, defocus, and occlusion. Implementation demonstrated with synthetic and experimental images.

Conclusion: Guidelines provided for selecting appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses based on desired performance requirements.

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with
synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting
the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a
function of the desired performance.

TL;DR: Med-K2N is a cross-modal medical image synthesis framework that addresses K to N modality reconstruction challenges through adaptive weight learning, quality-driven fusion control, and modality identity consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical need for flexible modality reconstruction where missing imaging modalities need to be synthesized from available ones to support diagnosis, addressing challenges of heterogeneous modality contributions, fusion quality control, and modality identity consistency.

Method: Treats multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with quality-driven selection, using three modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation, plus Causal Modality Identity Module (CMIM) for modality consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance in cross-modal medical image synthesis.

Conclusion: The proposed Med-K2N framework effectively addresses key challenges in K to N medical generation through adaptive weight learning and quality-controlled fusion, providing a robust solution for clinical modality reconstruction needs.

Abstract: Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing
missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis.
Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore
K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we
model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target
tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from
noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in
multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing
inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive
workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal
information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with
quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive
weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns
through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative
modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for
adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.
Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal
Modality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between
generated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language
modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Med-K2N
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple
benchmarks. Source code is available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ELMF4EggQ is an ensemble learning framework that uses multimodal feature fusion (image, shape, weight) to classify egg grade and freshness non-destructively, achieving 86.57% accuracy for grade and 70.83% for freshness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, non-destructive egg quality assessment is critical for food safety and operational efficiency in poultry production, but current methods require invasive internal measurements.

Method: Uses ensemble learning with multimodal features from external attributes (images via CNN models, shape, weight), PCA dimensionality reduction, SMOTE augmentation, and voting mechanism from best classifiers.

Result: Multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only and tabular-only baselines, achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in freshness prediction.

Conclusion: The framework enables accurate internal egg quality assessment using only external features, with publicly available dataset and code to promote transparency and further research.

Abstract: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring
food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in
commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble
learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade
and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A
novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,
with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert
assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and
Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only
external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding
labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from
external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and
weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature
extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,
DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,
SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning
algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the
best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only
and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble
approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in
freshness prediction. All code and data are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patch-ioner is a zero-shot captioning framework that shifts from image-centric to patch-centric paradigm, enabling captioning of arbitrary regions without region-level supervision by treating individual patches as atomic captioning units.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot captioners only use global image representations and produce whole-image captions, limiting their ability to describe specific regions or non-contiguous areas.

Method: Treats individual patches as atomic captioning units and aggregates them to describe arbitrary regions from single patches to non-contiguous areas and entire images, using backbones like DINO that produce meaningful dense visual features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple region-based captioning tasks including zero-shot dense, region-set, and trace captioning, outperforming other baselines and competitors.

Conclusion: Patch-wise semantic representations are effective for scalable caption generation, with dense visual features being key to achieving superior performance in region-based captioning tasks.

Abstract: Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space
vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired
image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a
text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global
representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a
unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to
a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without
the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image
representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and
aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to
non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that
enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.
Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual
features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in
multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and
state-of-the-art competitors, our models achieve better performance on
zero-shot dense, region-set, and a newly introduced trace captioning task,
highlighting the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for
scalable caption generation. Project page at https://paciosoft.com/Patch-ioner/ .

*Bing Li,Jiaxin Chen,Dongming Zhang,Xiuguo Bao,Di Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEACI-Net is a novel framework for compressed video action recognition that enhances motion representation and strengthens RGB-motion modality interaction through selective motion complement and cross-modality augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compressed video action recognition suffers from coarse/noisy dynamics and insufficient fusion of RGB and motion modalities, which limits performance despite reduced storage and computational costs.

Method: Two-stream architecture with RGB and motion streams. Motion stream uses multi-scale block with denoising module. Introduces Selective Motion Complement (SMC) to complement RGB with attentive local motion features, and Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) for selective feature augmentation between modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and efficiency in compressed video action recognition.

Conclusion: MEACI-Net successfully addresses the challenges of noisy motion dynamics and insufficient modality fusion in compressed video action recognition through enhanced motion representation and improved cross-modal interaction.

Abstract: Compressed video action recognition has recently drawn growing attention,
since it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing
raw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g.,
motion vectors and residuals). However, this task severely suffers from the
coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB
and motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a
novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion
Enhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for
the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the
motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to
enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is
then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and
Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality
with spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines
the two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments
on the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.

*Laith Nayal,Hadi Salloum,Ahmad Taha,Yaroslav Kholodov,Alexander Gasnikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation models fine-tuned for segmentation can inherently detect out-of-distribution regions without outlier supervision using a simple training-free clustering approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether vision foundation models can detect unknown objects in semantic segmentation for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, without requiring outlier supervision.

Method: Proposed a training-free approach using InternImage backbone features with K-Means clustering and confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters.

Result: Achieved 50.02 AP on RoadAnomaly and 48.77 AP on ADE-OoD benchmarks with InternImage-L, outperforming supervised and unsupervised baselines.

Conclusion: Foundation models show promising capability for generic OoD segmentation with minimal assumptions and no additional data requirements.

Abstract: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision
foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced
visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well
across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is
established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in
semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate
whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently
distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier
supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features
from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside
confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our
method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77
on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised
and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direction for
generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional
data.

*Xin Zou,Di Lu,Yizhou Wang,Yibo Yan,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Xu Zheng,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloV is a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for MLLMs that addresses limitations of attention-first pruning approaches by adaptively distributing pruning budgets across spatial crops to maintain global visual context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs suffer from computational overhead due to massive visual tokens, and existing attention-first pruning methods preserve semantically similar tokens, causing performance drops under high pruning ratios.

Method: HoloV rethinks token retention holistically by adaptively distributing pruning budget across different spatial crops, ensuring retained tokens capture global visual context rather than isolated salient features.

Result: HoloV achieves superior performance across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios. LLaVA1.5 with HoloV preserves 95.8% of original performance after pruning 88.9% of visual tokens.

Conclusion: HoloV provides an effective solution for efficient MLLM inference by minimizing representational collapse and maintaining task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning, achieving superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on
massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate
this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or
[\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this
work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning
approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting
in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we
propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning
framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first
schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By
adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,
HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather
than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational
collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance
across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA
methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the
original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

*Nikoo Naghavian,Mostafa Tavassolipour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAW (Confidence-Aware Weighting) improves zero-shot robustness in vision-language models through confidence-aware loss and feature alignment regularization, outperforming recent methods with better clean and robust accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models like CLIP show strong zero-shot generalization but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, creating a need for improved robustness without sacrificing generalization.

Method: CAW consists of two components: (1) Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by scaling KL divergence, and (2) feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by minimizing distance between frozen and fine-tuned encoder features.

Result: Extensive experiments on TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show CAW outperforms recent methods like PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while using less memory.

Conclusion: CAW effectively enhances zero-shot robustness in vision-language models by jointly improving clean and robust accuracy without compromising generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot
generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot
robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a
Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by
scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a
feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by
minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on
adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and
robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on
TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent
methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while
using less memory.

*Daphne Tsolissou,Theofanis Ganitidis,Konstantinos Mitsis,Stergios CHristodoulidis,Maria Vakalopoulou,Konstantina Nikita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates large vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by integrating ultrasound imaging with clinical data. While general LVLMs struggle with medical tasks, domain-adapted models show improved stroke risk stratification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging information in a transparent, interpretable way for clinicians.

Method: Proposed a framework using interview-style question sequences to evaluate LVLMs. Adapted LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for ultrasound domain, and integrated multimodal tabular data as text.

Result: Zero-shot LVLMs performed poorly in risk classification. Domain-adapted models showed substantial improvements in stroke risk stratification. Multimodal data integration enhanced specificity and balanced accuracy, achieving competitive performance compared to CNN baselines.

Conclusion: LVLMs show promise but have limitations in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction. Multimodal integration, model calibration, and domain adaptation are crucial for clinical translation.

Abstract: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major
clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging
information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.
This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large
vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by
integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,
laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic
diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,
comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and
medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very
powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,
while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address
this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke
risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of
text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive
performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines
trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,
underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and
domain adaptation for clinical translation.

TL;DR: FDA-VAE is a lightweight variational autoencoder that separates shared and independent features in multi-phase contrast-enhanced MRI synthesis using symmetric latent distributions and bidirectional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis use inefficient deep autoencoders with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable training strategies for feature separation.

Method: Proposes FDA-VAE that encodes input and target images into two latent distributions symmetric to standard normal distribution, using Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy for interpretable feature separation.

Result: FDA-VAE significantly reduces model parameters and inference time while improving synthesis quality compared to existing deep autoencoder-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed FDA-VAE provides an efficient and interpretable solution for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis with better performance and reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase
contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep
autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable
training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment
Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model
for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images
into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal
distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The
Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability
of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep
autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces
model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis
quality. The source code is publicly available at

### [34] [TIT-Score: Evaluating Long-Prompt Based Text-to-Image Alignment via Text-to-Image-to-Text Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02987)
*Juntong Wang,Huiyu Duan,Jiarui Wang,Ziheng Jia,Guangtao Zhai,Xiongkuo Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LPG-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating long-prompt text-to-image generation with 200 detailed prompts, and proposes TIT, a novel zero-shot metric for assessing alignment between prompts and generated images using text-to-image-to-text consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with long and detailed prompts, showing inconsistent generation quality, and existing evaluation metrics don't align well with human preferences for long-prompt scenarios.

Method: Created LPG-Bench with 200 long prompts (avg 250+ words) and generated 2,600 images from 13 models. Proposed TIT metric that compares consistency between original prompts and LMM-generated descriptions of images, with two instantiations: TIT-Score and TIT-Score-LLM.

Result: TIT framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to existing metrics, with TIT-Score-LLM showing 7.31% absolute improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline.

Conclusion: LPG-Bench and TIT methods provide comprehensive tools to benchmark and advance text-to-image model development, particularly for long-prompt scenarios.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent
text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate
great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively
understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench
features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250
words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.
Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models
and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,
we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor
consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To
address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on
text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating
long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I
alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the
LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient
score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based
instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to
CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute
improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT
methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the
development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 3DEditFormer is a new framework for 3D editing that introduces the largest paired 3D editing benchmark (3DEditVerse) and a 3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer model that enables precise edits without requiring manual 3D masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D editing remains challenging due to cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and fine-grained controllability requirements. Existing approaches are slow, prone to geometric distortions, or dependent on error-prone manual 3D masks.

Method: Proposes 3DEditVerse dataset (116K training pairs, 1.5K test pairs) built through pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits. Develops 3DEditFormer transformer with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating to disentangle editable regions from preserved structure.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and scalable 3D editing.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses key challenges in 3D editing by advancing both data (large-scale benchmark) and model (structure-preserving transformer) fronts, enabling precise and consistent edits without auxiliary 3D masks.

Abstract: 3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D
asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital
entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging
due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and
fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to
geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are
error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the
data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest
paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training
pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of
pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,
3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic
alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a
3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D
generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer
disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and
consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both
quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and
scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project:

*Sara Mobsite,Renaud Hostache,Laure Berti Equille,Emmanuel Roux,Joris Guerin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses land cover segmentation challenges in tropical regions by developing cloud injection for realistic testing and proposing NDI injection to preserve spatial features in deep networks, showing improved performance with radar-optical fusion under cloud cover.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Sentinel-2 datasets are mostly cloud-free, limiting their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are common. There's also a problem of losing spatial/spectral details during encoder downsampling in deep networks.

Method: Developed a cloud injection algorithm to simulate realistic cloud cover, and proposed a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs) into final decoding layers to retain key spatial features with minimal computation.

Result: NDI injection enhanced land cover segmentation on DFC2020 dataset with improvements of 1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone.

Conclusion: Radar-optical fusion is highly effective in challenging atmospheric scenarios, and the proposed methods successfully address cloud cover limitations and feature preservation issues in land cover semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on
labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are
cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are
common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud
injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test
how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed
optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral
details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we
propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)
into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial
features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land
cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of
1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under
cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant
performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging
atmospheric scenarios.

TL;DR: PocketSR is an ultra-lightweight single-step model for real-world image super-resolution that achieves high performance while being practical for edge deployment through efficient architecture design and pruning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RealSR methods using large generative models have high computational costs and latency, making them impractical for edge devices. There's a need for lightweight yet high-fidelity solutions.

Method: Designed LiteED as an efficient VAE alternative (97.5% parameter reduction), used online annealing pruning for U-Net to shift generative priors to lightweight modules, and incorporated multi-layer feature distillation loss to preserve knowledge during pruning.

Result: PocketSR achieves 0.8 seconds processing time for 4K images with only 146M parameters, delivering performance comparable to state-of-the-art single-step and multi-step RealSR models.

Conclusion: PocketSR provides a highly practical solution for edge-device RealSR applications, demonstrating that lightweight models can achieve performance on par with much larger models through careful architectural design and optimization.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality
of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing
methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the
high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment.
In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model
that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high
fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to
the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5%
while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose
online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative
priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective
knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of
prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature
distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we
provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of
146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a
remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on
par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making
it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

Motivation: Existing multi-event text-to-video generation methods overlook intrinsic factors in event shifting, particularly the timing and location of control during event transitions.

Method: Developed MEve (a self-curated prompt suite) and conducted extensive experiments on OpenSora and CogVideoX model families to analyze multi-event generation control mechanisms.

Result: Experiments revealed the importance of early intervention in denoising steps and block-wise model layers for controlling event transitions in multi-event video generation.

Conclusion: The study identifies essential factors for multi-event video generation and highlights possibilities for future multi-event conditioning models.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has surged in response to challenging
questions, especially when a long video must depict multiple sequential events
with temporal coherence and controllable content. Existing methods that extend
to multi-event generation omit an inspection of the intrinsic factor in event

introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event
text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two

TL;DR: The paper studies how design choices affect compositional generalization in visual generative models, finding that training objective type (discrete vs continuous) and conditioning information are key factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand mechanisms that enable or inhibit compositional generalization in visual generative models, as this ability is crucial for generating novel combinations of known concepts.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments to analyze how different design choices influence compositional generalization, focusing on training objective type and conditioning information.

Result: Identified two key factors: (1) whether training objective operates on discrete vs continuous distribution, and (2) extent of conditioning information about constituent concepts during training. Showed that relaxing MaskGIT discrete loss with auxiliary continuous JEPA-based objective improves compositional performance.

Conclusion: Design choices significantly impact compositional generalization, and combining discrete and continuous objectives can enhance compositional capabilities in visual generative models.

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of
known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all
mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence
compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or
negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i)
whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous
distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about
the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show
that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based
objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like
MaskGIT.

TL;DR: Proposes a latent space perturbation method for diffusion models to create 'unlearnable' training samples that resist unauthorized personalization while maintaining visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about data privacy, intellectual property protection, and unauthorized usage of personalization techniques in text-to-image diffusion models by creating imperceptible unlearnable samples.

Method: A model-based perturbation strategy operating in the latent space of diffusion models, alternating between denoising and inversion while modifying the starting point of the denoising trajectory (trajectory-shifted sampling).

Result: Achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility (~8-10% on PSNR, SSIM, FID) and robustness (~10% on average across five adversarial settings) against state-of-the-art inversion attacks on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates unlearnability into Latent Diffusion Models framework, providing practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation while safeguarding sensitive data.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few
user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead
to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and
unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,
the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image
poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited
imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images
with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based
perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion
models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying
the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This
trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high
visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and
personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates
unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a
practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We
validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness
against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on
perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$
on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in
safeguarding sensitive data.

*Zhiting Mei,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geometry-grounded semantic features in radiance fields provide finer structural details but surprisingly decrease pose estimation accuracy, while visual-only features offer greater versatility for downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether geometry-grounded semantic features offer advantages over visual-only features in distilled radiance fields for spatial tasks like pose estimation.

Method: Proposed SPINE framework with two components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics and fine inversion using photometric-based optimization. Compared geometry-grounded vs visual-only features across three critical questions about spatial-grounding fidelity, semantic localization, and radiance field inversion accuracy.

Result: Geometry-grounded features contain finer structural details but show no significant improvement in semantic object localization and surprisingly decrease pose estimation accuracy compared to visual-only features.

Conclusion: Visual-only features offer greater versatility for broader downstream tasks, highlighting the need for future research on effective geometry-grounding strategies that enhance both geometric detail and versatility of pretrained semantic features.

Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

### [43] [GeoComplete: Geometry-Aware Diffusion for Reference-Driven Image Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03110)
*Beibei Lin,Tingting Chen,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoComplete is a novel framework for reference-driven image completion that uses explicit 3D structural guidance and a dual-branch diffusion architecture to ensure geometric consistency, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative methods for reference-driven image completion rely solely on diffusion priors without geometric cues, leading to misaligned or implausible content when target views differ significantly from references.

Method: Uses a dual-branch diffusion architecture: one branch synthesizes missing regions from masked target, while the other extracts geometric features from projected point clouds. Incorporates target-aware masking to detect occluded areas and focus on relevant reference cues.

Result: Achieves 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

Conclusion: GeoComplete provides a unified and robust solution for geometry-conditioned image completion by integrating geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion with target-aware masking.

Abstract: Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target
view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view
differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely
solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or
depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,
a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce
geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior
image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the
diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,
and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference
cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch
synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other
extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint
self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To
address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the
target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked
during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful
cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a
geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking
strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for
geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete
achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly
boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

*Kaisi Guan,Xihua Wang,Zhengfeng Lai,Xin Cheng,Peng Zhang,XiaoJiang Liu,Ruihua Song,Meng Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework for Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation that addresses modal interference and cross-modal interaction challenges through hierarchical captioning and a dual-tower diffusion transformer with bidirectional attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve two key challenges in T2SV generation: (1) modal interference caused by shared text captions confusing pretrained backbones, and (2) unclear optimal mechanisms for cross-modal feature interaction between audio and video.

Method: The method includes: (1) Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC) framework that generates disentangled video and audio captions to eliminate interference, and (2) BridgeDiT, a dual-tower diffusion transformer with Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism for symmetric bidirectional information exchange between modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with human evaluations show state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed contributions.

Conclusion: The proposed HVGC and BridgeDiT framework successfully addresses T2SV challenges, achieving semantic and temporal synchronization between audio and video modalities, with codes and checkpoints to be publicly released.

Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task,
Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with
synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are
aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical
challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where
the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal
interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism
for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these
challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)
framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and
an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on
HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,
which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust
``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,
achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive
ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions,
offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints
will be publicly released.

*Shiyi Zhang,Dong Liang,Hairong Zheng,Yihang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAVIR model reconstructs visual information from brain activity by separating visual cortex into hierarchical regions, extracting structural and semantic features separately, and integrating them via Versatile Diffusion for improved image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to accurately reconstruct complex visual stimuli due to heterogeneous low-level features and semantically entangled high-level features in natural scenes.

Method: Separates visual cortex into hierarchical regions: Structural Generator extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels as latent diffusion priors, and Semantic Extractor converts semantic processing voxels into CLIP embeddings, then integrates via Versatile Diffusion model.

Result: HAVIR enhances both structural and semantic quality of reconstructions in complex scenes and outperforms existing models.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach inspired by visual cortex representation theory successfully improves visual information reconstruction from brain activity.

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters
interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision.
However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly
complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of
natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level
features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the
hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR
model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and
extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator
extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it
into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic
processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the
Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results
demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of
reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

*Gen Li,Bo Zhao,Jianfei Yang,Laura Sevilla-Lara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mask2IV is a two-stage framework for generating interaction-centric videos without requiring dense mask annotations, using motion trajectory prediction and video generation with versatile control options.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to model complex human/robot-object interactions, and obtaining dense mask annotations for real-world use is challenging.

Method: Decoupled two-stage pipeline: first predicts motion trajectories for actor and object, then generates video conditioned on these trajectories. Supports control via target object specification, action descriptions, or spatial position cues.

Result: Achieves superior visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines across human-object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios.

Conclusion: Mask2IV provides an effective solution for interaction-centric video generation without dense mask inputs, offering flexible control and high-quality results.

Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning,
epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb
Graphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that
preserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining
individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic

TL;DR: SpineMed introduces the first large-scale vertebral-level multimodal dataset (SpineMed-450k) and evaluation framework (SpineBench) for AI-assisted spine diagnosis, addressing limitations in current datasets and enabling fine-grained reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of disability, but AI-assisted diagnosis is limited by the lack of level-aware, multimodal datasets that support clinical decision-making requiring reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific vertebral levels.

Method: Developed SpineMed ecosystem co-designed with spine surgeons, featuring SpineMed-450k dataset curated from diverse sources using clinician-in-the-loop pipeline with two-stage LLM generation (draft and revision), and SpineBench evaluation framework for clinically salient axes including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.

Result: Evaluation of advanced LVLMs on SpineBench revealed systematic weaknesses in fine-grained, level-specific reasoning. The model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k demonstrated consistent and significant improvements across all tasks, with clinician assessments confirming diagnostic clarity and practical utility.

Conclusion: SpineMed addresses critical gaps in spine AI by providing traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized benchmarks, enabling improved AI-assisted diagnosis through vertebral-level reasoning across multiple imaging modalities.

Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of
disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of
level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders
requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific
vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of
traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized,
spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem
co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the
first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning
across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and
SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is
curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets,
and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline
with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure
high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations,
and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes,
including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.
Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language
models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained,
level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks.
Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of
our model's outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing domain-specific forgery detection methods, which have poor cross-domain generalization and lack integrated adaptive frameworks, especially given the increasing realism of synthetic images posing societal risks.

Method: Proposes UniShield with two agents: a perception agent that analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection models, and a detection agent that consolidates various expert detectors into a unified framework and generates interpretable reports.

Result: Extensive experiments show UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing unified approaches and domain-specific detectors.

Conclusion: UniShield demonstrates superior practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability for detecting and localizing image forgeries across diverse domains including image manipulation, document manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become
increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as
misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus
emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal
security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection
methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their
narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an
integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,
the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing
image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document
manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively
integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent
intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection
models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a
unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments
show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing
unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior
practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.

Method: Samples object appearance under multiple lighting environments, trains a lighting-conditioned NeRF with dual-branch architecture to encode general lighting effects and specularities separately.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets on most metrics, demonstrates effectiveness on real-world object captures.

Conclusion: ROGR enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,
where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our
approach on real-world object captures.

Abstract: Interactive 3D biomedical image segmentation requires efficient models that

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PQGAN integrates product quantization into VQGAN framework, achieving significant improvements in image reconstruction quality and enabling faster/higher-resolution generation with diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Product quantization has been underutilized for latent representations in high-fidelity image generation despite its scalability, while VQGAN has shown success but has limitations.

Method: Integrates product quantization into VQGAN framework, analyzing interaction between codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorization. Uses vector and scalar quantization as special cases.

Result: Achieves PSNR of 37dB (vs 27dB prior), reduces FID, LPIPS, and CMMD scores by up to 96%. Enables faster generation or doubled output resolution with diffusion models at no additional cost.

Conclusion: PQGAN demonstrates product quantization as a strong extension for discrete latent representations in image synthesis, with novel findings about scaling behavior and optimal hyperparameter selection.

Abstract: Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding,
yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image
generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder
that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of
VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and
their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior
work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up
to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between
codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with
vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such
that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the
embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ
that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that
PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This
enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or
a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a
strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.

TL;DR: Memory Forcing is a learning framework that combines temporal and spatial memory to improve long-term spatial consistency in autoregressive video diffusion models for Minecraft gameplay simulation, while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive video diffusion models need to generate natural content during exploration while preserving spatial consistency when revisiting areas, but face a trade-off between temporal-only memory (lacking consistency) and spatial memory (potentially degrading new scene generation quality).

Method: Uses Memory Forcing framework with: 1) Hybrid Training for different gameplay regimes, 2) Chained Forward Training with model rollouts, 3) Point-to-Frame Retrieval for efficient history access, and 4) Incremental 3D Reconstruction for maintaining an explicit 3D cache.

Result: Achieves superior long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse environments while maintaining computational efficiency for extended sequences.

Conclusion: Memory Forcing effectively balances the trade-off between temporal and spatial memory, enabling faithful simulation of gameplay with both natural exploration and consistent revisits.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world
modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a
representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate
natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency
when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must
compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which
exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,
whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene
generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.
We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols
with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct
gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during
exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward
Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained
predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial
memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently
retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,
while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior
long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse
environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended
sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks tools to evaluate alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text), and surrounding context (scene), despite the intuitive relationship between these modalities in human movement.

Method: MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging unimodal and cross-modal representations, inspired by modeling higher-order relations to capture intricate dependencies between modalities.

Result: MonSTeR outperforms trimodal models relying solely on unimodal representations and demonstrates versatility through zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning tasks.

Conclusion: The model successfully enables robust cross-modal retrieval across various tasks, with retrieval scores validated to align with human preferences through user studies.

Abstract: Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement
can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive
nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to
evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text),
and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the
first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of
higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging
unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the
intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust
retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms
trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we
validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a
dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space
on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and

TL;DR: A training-free, architecture-agnostic test-time defense that uses stochastic resonance by introducing small translational perturbations to combat adversarial attacks without information loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To defend against adversarial attacks without relying on feature filtering or smoothing that causes information loss, and to create a generic defense applicable to various tasks.

Method: Introduces small translational perturbations to input images, aligns transformed feature embeddings, aggregates them, and maps back to original reference using a closed-form formula.

Result: Recovers up to 68.1% accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9% on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The method provides state-of-the-art robustness as a training-free, attack-agnostic defense that works across diverse network architectures and tasks including dense prediction.

Abstract: We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:
imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a
model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,
which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by
leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing
information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to
the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them
before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a
closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network
architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for
specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,
architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show
state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,
establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including
stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and
practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our
method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%
on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of
adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing randomized neural networks for texture recognition have focused mainly on cross-information prediction without significant architectural improvements, leaving room for better texture representation learning.

Method: The method uses hyperspherical random embeddings with a dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel relationships, enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for building rich texture representations.

Result: Experimental results show interesting performance across several pure texture benchmarks with distinct characteristics and challenges.

Conclusion: Mixer demonstrates promising results for texture representation learning through its novel randomized network architecture combining hyperspherical embeddings and dual-branch learning.

Abstract: Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently
achieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining
the advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches.
However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving
cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to
the overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a
novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its
core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a
dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel
relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for
building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the
interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture
benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. The source code

### [57] [Improving GUI Grounding with Explicit Position-to-Coordinate Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03230)
*Suyuchen Wang,Tianyu Zhang,Ahmed Masry,Christopher Pal,Spandana Gella,Bang Liu,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RULER tokens and Interleaved MRoPE to improve GUI grounding accuracy by providing explicit spatial guidance instead of relying on implicit coordinate generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with GUI grounding due to unreliable patch-to-pixel mapping, especially when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training. Text-based coordinate generation forces implicit learning of complex mappings, leading to accuracy degradation.

Method: Two innovations: 1) RULER tokens as explicit coordinate markers for position referencing, and 2) Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) for improved spatial encoding that ensures equal representation of width and height dimensions.

Result: Experiments on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in grounding accuracy, with largest improvements on high-resolution interfaces.

Conclusion: By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on implicit learning, the approach enables more reliable GUI automation across diverse resolutions and platforms.

Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel
coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for
current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which
breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.
Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual
features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings
implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new
resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER
tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference
positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate
coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial
encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,
addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on
ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in
grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution
interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on
implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across
diverse resolutions and platforms.

TL;DR: LEAML is a label-efficient adaptation framework for MLLMs that uses pseudo question-answer pairs and selective neuron updates to improve performance on specialized domains with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with out-of-distribution tasks in specialized domains like medical imaging where labeled data is scarce and expensive to obtain.

Method: Generates domain-relevant pseudo QA pairs for unlabeled data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation, and selectively updates only neurons relevant to question-answering.

Result: Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA show LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under minimal supervision.

Conclusion: LEAML framework effectively adapts MLLMs to specialized domains with limited labeled data through pseudo QA generation and selective neuron updates.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in
specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and
expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that
leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our
approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled
data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we
selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,
enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge
during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA
demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under
minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML
framework.

*Wannan Yang,Xinchi Qiu,Lei Yu,Yuchen Zhang,Oliver Aobo Yang,Narine Kokhlikyan,Nicola Cancedda,Diego Garcia-Olano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASAL is an efficient algorithm that bakes activation steering benefits into model weights, reducing hallucinations by 30-40% while being highly compute and data efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate by providing incorrect answers instead of admitting ignorance, and existing activation steering methods require real-time intervention during inference.

Method: Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning (CASAL) - trains only a submodule of a single transformer layer to directly incorporate activation steering benefits into model weights.

Result: Reduces hallucination by 30-40% across multiple QA benchmarks, 30x more compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than LoRA baselines, and generalizes to OOD domains and both dense/MoE models.

Conclusion: CASAL represents a promising step for applying interpretability-inspired methods in practical deployment systems, effectively mitigating hallucinations in both text-only and vision-language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often
hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting
ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of
their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations.
These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during
inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning
(CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized
optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into
model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining
from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training
only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by
30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more
compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines
such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce
domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in
both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first
steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both
dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step
forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment
in production systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RA-FSM is a modular GPT-based research assistant that uses a finite-state control loop (Relevance → Confidence → Knowledge) with vector retrieval and deterministic citation to provide well-cited, transparent answers for technical domains like photonics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models accelerate literature synthesis but often hallucinate and mis-cite, limiting their usefulness in expert workflows where accuracy and proper citation are critical.

Method: A finite-state control loop with three stages: Relevance filtering, Confidence scoring, and Knowledge retrieval. Uses vector retrieval and deterministic citation pipeline with ranked-tier ingestion from journals, conferences, preprints, and patents. Includes question decomposition and selective retrieval triggering.

Result: In blinded A/B reviews, domain experts preferred RA-FSM over Notebook LM and vanilla GPT API, citing better boundary-condition handling and more defensible evidence use. System explores beyond Notebook LM while maintaining tunable latency and cost overheads.

Conclusion: RA-FSM provides transparent, well-cited answers for high-stakes technical work and is generalizable to other scientific domains, addressing key limitations of current LLMs in expert workflows.

Abstract: Large language models accelerate literature synthesis but can hallucinate and
mis-cite, limiting their usefulness in expert workflows. We present RA-FSM
(Research Assistant - Finite State Machine), a modular GPT-based research
assistant that wraps generation in a finite-state control loop: Relevance ->
Confidence -> Knowledge. The system is grounded in vector retrieval and a
deterministic citation pipeline. The controller filters out-of-scope queries,
scores answerability, decomposes questions, and triggers retrieval only when
needed, and emits answers with confidence labels and in-corpus, de-duplicated
references. A ranked-tier ingestion workflow constructs a domain knowledge base
from journals, conferences, indices, preprints, and patents, writing both to a
dense vector index and to a relational store of normalized metrics. We
implement the system for photonics and evaluate it on six task categories:
analytical reasoning, numerical analysis, methodological critique, comparative
synthesis, factual extraction, and application design. In blinded A/B reviews,
domain experts prefer RA-FSM to both a strong Notebook LM (NLM) and a vanilla
Default GPT API call single-pass baseline, citing stronger boundary-condition
handling and more defensible evidence use. Coverage and novelty analyses
indicate that RA-FSM explores beyond the NLM while incurring tunable latency
and cost overheads. The design emphasizes transparent, well-cited answers for
high-stakes technical work and is generalizable to other scientific domains.

*So Kuroki,Yotaro Kubo,Takuya Akiba,Yujin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid speech-to-speech system that combines real-time S2S responsiveness with LLM knowledge injection to achieve both low latency and semantic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between low-latency but knowledge-poor real-time S2S models and high-latency but knowledge-rich cascaded systems (ASR+LLM+TTS).

Method: Process speech through S2S transformer for immediate response while concurrently sending query to back-end LLM, then inject LLM's text response to guide S2S speech generation in real time.

Result: Substantially outperforms baseline S2S in correctness, approaching cascaded system performance, while maintaining baseline-level latency.

Conclusion: Hybrid architecture successfully combines benefits of both paradigms - real-time responsiveness with enhanced knowledge representation.

Abstract: Real-time speech-to-speech (S2S) models excel at generating natural,
low-latency conversational responses but often lack deep knowledge and semantic
understanding. Conversely, cascaded systems combining automatic speech
recognition, a text-based Large Language Model (LLM), and text-to-speech
synthesis offer superior knowledge representation at the cost of high latency,
which disrupts the flow of natural interaction. This paper introduces a novel
hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Our
framework processes user speech through an S2S transformer for immediate
responsiveness while concurrently relaying the query to a powerful back-end
LLM. The LLM's text-based response is then injected in real time to guide the
S2S model's speech generation, effectively infusing its output with rich
knowledge without the full latency penalty of a cascaded system. We evaluated
our method using a speech-synthesized variant of the MT-Bench benchmark that
consists of multi-turn question-answering sessions. The results demonstrate
that our system substantially outperforms a baseline S2S model in response
correctness, approaching that of a cascaded system, while maintaining a latency
on par with the baseline.

TL;DR: AMANDA is a training-free agentic framework that enhances medical multimodal LLMs by addressing reasoning bottlenecks through intrinsic question decomposition and extrinsic knowledge graph retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Med-MLLMs fail in low-resource settings due to two reasoning bottlenecks: ignoring medical image details and lacking specialized medical knowledge integration.

Method: Proposes AMANDA framework with intrinsic medical knowledge augmentation (coarse-to-fine question decomposition) and extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation (biomedical knowledge graph retrieval).

Result: Extensive experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks show substantial improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot medical visual question answering settings.

Conclusion: AMANDA effectively addresses medical reasoning bottlenecks and demonstrates strong performance in low-resource medical VQA scenarios without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) have shown great promise
in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA). However, when deployed in
low-resource settings where abundant labeled data are unavailable, existing
Med-MLLMs commonly fail due to their medical reasoning capability bottlenecks:
(i) the intrinsic reasoning bottleneck that ignores the details from the
medical image; (ii) the extrinsic reasoning bottleneck that fails to
incorporate specialized medical knowledge. To address those limitations, we
propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical
knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical
knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for
comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds
the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive
experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial
improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings. The code is

TL;DR: SelfJudge enables faster LLM inference through self-supervised judge decoding that verifies draft tokens based on semantic preservation rather than exact matches, achieving better speed-accuracy trade-offs than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing judge decoding methods for speculative LLM inference rely on human annotations or tasks with verifiable ground truths, limiting their generalizability across diverse NLP tasks.

Method: SelfJudge trains judge verifiers via self-supervision of the target model by measuring semantic preservation - assessing whether token-substituted responses maintain the meaning of original responses, enabling automatic training across diverse tasks.

Result: Experiments show SelfJudge achieves superior inference-accuracy trade-offs compared to judge decoding baselines.

Conclusion: SelfJudge offers a broadly applicable solution for faster LLM inference that works across diverse NLP tasks without requiring human annotations or verifiable ground truths.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by verifying candidate tokens
from a draft model against a larger target model. Recent judge decoding boosts
this process by relaxing verification criteria by accepting draft tokens that
may exhibit minor discrepancies from target model output, but existing methods
are restricted by their reliance on human annotations or tasks with verifiable
ground truths, limiting generalizability across diverse NLP tasks. We propose
SelfJudge, which trains judge verifiers via self-supervision of the target
model. Our method measures semantic preservation by assessing whether
token-substituted responses preserve the meaning of original responses,
enabling automatic verifier training across diverse NLP tasks. Our experiments
show SelfJudge achieves superior inference-accuracy trade-offs than judge
decoding baselines, offering a broadly applicable solution for faster LLM
inference.

*Junlong Jia,Ziyang Chen,Xing Wu,Chaochen Gao,Zijia Lin,Debing Zhang,Songlin Hu,Binghui Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EntropyLong is a novel data construction method that uses predictive uncertainty to verify genuine long-range dependencies for training long-context language models, outperforming existing approaches on benchmark tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for training long-context models fail to guarantee genuine long-range dependencies, often relying on generic text concatenation or heuristics that may create spurious correlations.

Method: The approach identifies high-entropy positions in documents, retrieves semantically relevant contexts from large corpora, and verifies their utility by assessing whether they reduce prediction entropy through model-in-the-loop verification.

Result: Models trained on EntropyLong data show significant improvements on RULER benchmarks, especially in tasks requiring distant information, and achieve substantial gains on LongBenchv2 after instruction fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Extensive ablation studies validate the necessity and effectiveness of entropy-based verification for long-context training, demonstrating that verified dependencies provide measurable information gain.

Abstract: Training long-context language models to capture long-range dependencies
requires specialized data construction. Current approaches, such as generic
text concatenation or heuristic-based variants, frequently fail to guarantee
genuine long-range dependencies. We propose EntropyLong, a novel data
construction method that leverages predictive uncertainty to verify dependency
quality. Our approach identifies high-entropy positions in documents, retrieves
semantically relevant contexts from large corpora, and verifies their utility
by assessing whether they reduce prediction entropy. This model-in-the-loop
verification ensures each dependency represents measurable information gain
rather than spurious correlation. We construct training samples with long-range
dependencies by combining original documents with these verified contextual
supplements. Using FineWebEdu and Cosmopedia, we generate a dataset of
128K-length sequences with verified dependencies. Models trained on this data
demonstrate significant improvements on RULER benchmarks, particularly in tasks
requiring distant information. Following instruction fine-tuning, our models
also achieve substantial gains on LongBenchv2, demonstrating enhanced
long-context understanding. Extensive ablation studies further validate the
necessity and effectiveness of entropybased verification for long-context
training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the lack of public conversational recommender system (CRS) data by developing a methodology to generate natural, consistent dialogues using behavior simulators and language model prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of public CRS data makes fine-tuning language models for conversational recommender systems challenging, and existing user simulators often lack behavioral consistency.

Method: Developed a methodology combining behavior simulators with LM-prompting to generate natural dialogues consistent with users' underlying states, applied to create a large open-source CRS dataset with preference elicitation and example critiquing.

Result: Generated a large, open-source CRS dataset, with rater evaluation showing the dialogues exhibit considerable consistency, factuality, and naturalness.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology successfully generates high-quality CRS dialogues that address data scarcity issues while maintaining behavioral consistency and naturalness.

Abstract: While language models (LMs) offer great potential for conversational
recommender systems (CRSs), the paucity of public CRS data makes fine-tuning
LMs for CRSs challenging. In response, LMs as user simulators qua data
generators can be used to train LM-based CRSs, but often lack behavioral
consistency, generating utterance sequences inconsistent with those of any real
user. To address this, we develop a methodology for generating natural
dialogues that are consistent with a user's underlying state using behavior
simulators together with LM-prompting. We illustrate our approach by generating
a large, open-source CRS data set with both preference elicitation and example
critiquing. Rater evaluation on some of these dialogues shows them to exhibit
considerable consistency, factuality and naturalness.

TL;DR: The paper proposes look-ahead Sync, a neural linguistic steganography method that overcomes capacity limitations of SyncPool while maintaining provable security by performing minimal synchronization only on truly indistinguishable token sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental challenge of tokenization ambiguity in neural linguistic steganography, which causes catastrophic decoding failures, and overcome the capacity sacrifice in SyncPool that uses entire Shannon entropy for synchronization rather than payload embedding.

Method: Look-ahead Sync method that performs minimal synchronized sampling only on truly indistinguishable token sequences while strategically preserving all other discernible paths to maximize embedding capacity. Theoretical proofs for security and analysis of capacity gap from theoretical upper bound.

Result: Experiments on English (Llama 3) and Chinese (Qwen 2.5) benchmarks show the method consistently approaches theoretical capacity upper bound, significantly outperforming SyncPool with embedding rate improvements exceeding 160% in English and 25% in Chinese, especially with larger candidate pools.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant step toward practical high-capacity provably secure linguistic steganography by overcoming capacity limitations while retaining security guarantees.

Abstract: Neural linguistic steganography aims to embed information
  into natural text while preserving statistical undetectability. A fundamental
challenge in this ffeld stems from tokenization ambiguity in modern tokenizers,
which can lead to catastrophic decoding failures. The recent method, SyncPool,
addresses this ambiguity
  by employing a coarse-grained synchronization mechanism over groups of
ambiguous candidates. However, SyncPool sacriffces embedding capacity, as it
utilizes the entire Shannon entropy of an ambiguous group solely for
synchronization rather than for payload embedding. We propose a method named
look-ahead Sync, which overcomes the capacity limitation of SyncPool while
retaining its provable security guarantees. Our approach performs minimal
synchronized sampling only on truly indistinguishable token sequences, while
strategically preserving all other discernible paths to maximize embedding
capacity. We provide theoretical proofs for the security of our method and
analyze the gap between its achievable embedding capacity and the theoretical
upper bound. Experiments on English (using Llama 3) and Chinese (using Qwen
2.5) benchmarks show that our method consistently approaches the theoretical
capacity upper bound and signiffcantly outperforms SyncPool. The improvement in
embedding rate exceeds 160% in English and 25% in Chinese, particularly in
settings with larger candidate pools. This work represents a signiffcant step
toward practical high-capacity provably secure linguistic steganography.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attribution methods based on parameter gradients are often noisy and computationally complex, making it difficult to diagnose root causes of LLM failures like harmful content generation, factual inaccuracies, and societal biases.

Method: Proposes a framework that analyzes representation and its gradients directly in the model's activation space, providing semantically meaningful signals linking outputs to training data through representation-based attribution.

Result: The method excels at sample-level attribution and enables fine-grained token-level analysis, precisely identifying specific samples and phrases that causally influence model behavior across tasks including tracking harmful content, detecting backdoor poisoning, and identifying knowledge contamination.

Conclusion: This work provides a powerful diagnostic tool to understand, audit, and mitigate risks associated with LLMs by enabling efficient and precise attribution of undesirable behaviors to their training data sources.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their deployment is frequently undermined by undesirable behaviors such as
generating harmful content, factual inaccuracies, and societal biases.
Diagnosing the root causes of these failures poses a critical challenge for AI
safety. Existing attribution methods, particularly those based on parameter
gradients, often fall short due to prohibitive noisy signals and computational
complexity. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient framework that
diagnoses a range of undesirable LLM behaviors by analyzing representation and
its gradients, which operates directly in the model's activation space to
provide a semantically meaningful signal linking outputs to their training
data. We systematically evaluate our method for tasks that include tracking
harmful content, detecting backdoor poisoning, and identifying knowledge
contamination. The results demonstrate that our approach not only excels at
sample-level attribution but also enables fine-grained token-level analysis,
precisely identifying the specific samples and phrases that causally influence
model behavior. This work provides a powerful diagnostic tool to understand,
audit, and ultimately mitigate the risks associated with LLMs. The code is

Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can serve as practical assistants for mathematicians by filling in missing steps in complex proofs, addressing the underexplored challenge of subgoal completion.

Method: Created FormalML benchmark using Lean 4, built from foundational machine learning theories. Used translation tactic to convert procedural proofs into declarative form, extracting 4937 problems spanning optimization and probability inequalities.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art provers revealed persistent limitations in accuracy and efficiency for subgoal completion tasks.

Conclusion: There is a need for more capable LLM-based theorem provers to effectively handle subgoal completion in complex mathematical contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in formal theorem proving. Yet their ability to serve as practical assistants
for mathematicians, filling in missing steps within complex proofs, remains
underexplored. We identify this challenge as the task of subgoal completion,
where an LLM must discharge short but nontrivial proof obligations left
unresolved in a human-provided sketch. To study this problem, we introduce
FormalML, a Lean 4 benchmark built from foundational theories of machine
learning. Using a translation tactic that converts procedural proofs into
declarative form, we extract 4937 problems spanning optimization and
probability inequalities, with varying levels of difficulty. FormalML is the
first subgoal completion benchmark to combine premise retrieval and complex

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive evaluation framework that goes beyond single-score approaches and expands automated assessment from essays to diverse machine-generated text, addressing the need for interpretable trait-level analysis.

Method: Built on trait-based Automated Essay Scoring principles, CRACQ integrates linguistic, semantic, and structural signals into a cumulative assessment. It was trained on 500 synthetic grant proposals and benchmarked against LLM-as-a-judge approaches.

Result: CRACQ produces more stable and interpretable trait-level judgments than direct LLM evaluation, though challenges in reliability and domain scope remain.

Conclusion: CRACQ provides a promising rubric-driven methodology for multi-dimensional document evaluation that enables both holistic and trait-level analysis, offering advantages over single-score approaches despite some remaining limitations.

Abstract: This paper presents CRACQ, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework tailored

### [72] [Optimizing Long-Form Clinical Text Generation with Claim-Based Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02338)
*Samyak Jhaveri,Praphul Singh,Jangwon Kim,Tara Taghavi,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An evaluation-integrated reinforcement learning framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with DocLens evaluator for automated clinical documentation, improving factuality and completeness without separate reward models or human references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating clinical documentation requires precise alignment with priorities like completeness and factual grounding, addressing the need for accurate and comprehensive medical notes.

Method: Uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) coupled with DocLens, a claim-level evaluator providing deterministic, dialogue-grounded rewards. Includes reward-gating strategy to reduce training costs.

Result: Improves clinical note quality, reduces training cost. GPT-5 evaluation shows higher preference for GRPO outputs in factuality, completeness, brevity, with fewer omissions and hallucinations.

Conclusion: The framework is scalable to real-world settings, can incorporate custom objectives like guideline adherence or billing preferences, and improvements likely represent conservative lower bounds due to clean benchmarks and well-aligned base model.

Abstract: Automating clinical documentation with large language models requires precise
alignment with priorities such as completeness and factual grounding. We
present an evaluation-integrated reinforcement learning framework for long-form
clinical text generation that couples Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with DocLens, a claim-level evaluator that provides deterministic,
dialogue-grounded rewards. Our method directly optimizes factual grounding and
completeness without training a separate reward model or relying on
human-authored references. Empirically, the approach improves clinical note
quality and reduces training cost via a simple reward-gating strategy. An
independent GPT-5 qualitative evaluation further supports these gains, showing
higher preference for GRPO outputs in factuality, completeness, and brevity,
with fewer omissions and hallucinations. Because the benchmarks are relatively
clean and the base model already well aligned, these improvements likely
represent a conservative lower bound. The framework is scalable to real-world
settings and can incorporate custom objectives such as guideline adherence or
billing preferences.

### [73] [Evaluating Uncertainty Quantification Methods in Argumentative Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02339)
*Kevin Zhou,Adam Dejl,Gabriel Freedman,Lihu Chen,Antonio Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs) in claim verification tasks, finding that simple direct prompting outperforms more complex UQ approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure reliability of LLMs by integrating uncertainty quantification methods in argumentative LLMs for decision-making, where UQ plays a critical role in explainable AI frameworks.

Method: Experimental evaluation of ArgLLMs' performance on claim verification tasks using different LLM UQ methods, with the experimental procedure serving as a novel way to assess UQ effectiveness.

Result: Direct prompting, despite its simplicity, proved to be an effective UQ strategy in ArgLLMs, outperforming considerably more complex approaches.

Conclusion: Simple UQ methods like direct prompting can be highly effective in argumentative LLM frameworks, challenging the assumption that more complex approaches are necessarily better for uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Research in uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs)
is increasingly important towards guaranteeing the reliability of this
groundbreaking technology. We explore the integration of LLM UQ methods in
argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), an explainable LLM framework for decision-making
based on computational argumentation in which UQ plays a critical role. We
conduct experiments to evaluate ArgLLMs' performance on claim verification
tasks when using different LLM UQ methods, inherently performing an assessment
of the UQ methods' effectiveness. Moreover, the experimental procedure itself
is a novel way of evaluating the effectiveness of UQ methods, especially when
intricate and potentially contentious statements are present. Our results
demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, direct prompting is an effective UQ
strategy in ArgLLMs, outperforming considerably more complex approaches.

*Xin Gao,Ruiyi Zhang,Daniel Du,Saurabh Mahindre,Sai Ashish Somayajula,Pengtao Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether LLMs can simulate earlier knowledge cutoffs through prompting, finding they can forget direct factual knowledge but struggle with causally related information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address contamination concerns in LLM temporal prediction, where accurate predictions on pre-cutoff data may reflect memorization rather than reasoning, leading to overestimated generalization capability.

Method: Constructed three evaluation datasets to assess LLM forgetting capabilities: (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge, using prompting-based unlearning techniques.

Result: Prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs are effective for directly queried information after the cutoff date, but struggle to induce forgetting when the forgotten content is causally related to the query rather than directly asked.

Conclusion: Findings highlight the need for more rigorous evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks, as current prompting methods have limitations in simulating true knowledge forgetting.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for temporal prediction, but
their reliance on pretraining data raises contamination concerns, as accurate
predictions on pre-cutoff test data may reflect memorization rather than
reasoning, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capability.
With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural
question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff?
In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier
knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the
extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic
shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while
prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly
queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce
forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally
related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous
evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks. The full

### [75] [DRIFT: Learning from Abundant User Dissatisfaction in Real-World Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02341)
*Yifan Wang,Bolian Li,Junlin Wu,Zhaoxuan Tan,Zheli Liu,Ruqi Zhang,Ananth Grama,Qingkai Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRIFT is a new preference training method that uses abundant implicit user dissatisfaction signals from real-world LLM deployments instead of scarce explicit satisfaction feedback, achieving significant performance improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world LLM deployments generate abundant implicit user dissatisfaction signals (through refinements, corrections, preferences) while explicit satisfaction feedback is scarce, but existing preference learning methods rely on costly human annotations or assume plentiful positive responses.

Method: DRIFT anchors training on real-world DSAT (dissatisfaction) signals and samples positives dynamically from the evolving policy, preserving preference margins and avoiding gradient degeneration.

Result: DRIFT models achieve up to +6.23% (7B) / +7.61% (14B) on WildBench Task Score and up to +8.95% (7B) / +12.29% (14B) on AlpacaEval2 win rate over base models, outperforming DPO and SPIN. 14B models surpass GPT-4o-mini on WildBench.

Conclusion: DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training that leverages the most abundant and informative signal while preserving exploratory capacity and avoiding collapse to narrow solution subsets.

Abstract: Real-world large language model deployments (e.g., conversational AI systems,
code generation assistants) naturally generate abundant implicit user
dissatisfaction (DSAT) signals, as users iterate toward better answers through
refinements, corrections, and expressed preferences, while explicit
satisfaction (SAT) feedback is scarce. Existing preference learning approaches
are poorly aligned with this data profile, as they rely on costly human
annotations or assume plentiful positive responses. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{DRIFT} (\textbf{D}issatisfaction-\textbf{R}efined \textbf{I}terative
pre\textbf{F}erence \textbf{T}raining), which anchors training on real-world
DSAT signals and samples positives dynamically from the evolving policy.
Empirically, DRIFT models trained on real-world \textit{WildFeedback} datasets
and synthetic \textit{UltraFeedback} datasets achieve up to +6.23\% (7B) /
+7.61\% (14B) on WildBench Task Score and up to +8.95\% (7B) / +12.29\% (14B)
on AlpacaEval2 win rate over base models, outperforming strong baseline methods
such as iterative DPO and SPIN. At larger scales, the improvements are
particularly pronounced: 14B models trained with DRIFT surpass GPT-4o-mini on
WildBench. Further analysis shows that DRIFT also preserves exploratory
capacity, yielding more diverse high-reward solutions rather than collapsing to
narrow subsets. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this design preserves
preference margins and avoids the gradient degeneration. These results show
that DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training
that leverages the most abundant and informative signal. The code and data are

TL;DR: SIMPACT is a framework for creating privacy-respecting social media datasets to train LLM agents, with BluePrint as a political discourse dataset from Bluesky data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of standardized data for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs as realistic social media agents, enabling ethical studies of social media dynamics.

Method: Formulates next-action prediction as training task, uses clustering to create behavioral personas from anonymized data, includes 12 interaction types with contextual dependencies.

Result: Created BluePrint dataset with authentic engagement patterns while preserving privacy through pseudonymization and PII removal.

Conclusion: SIMPACT provides standardized data and evaluation protocols for rigorous, ethically responsible social media simulations, with BluePrint serving as benchmark for political discourse modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for simulating
social media dynamics at scale, enabling studies that would be ethically or
logistically challenging with human subjects. However, the field lacks
standardized data resources for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs as realistic
social media agents. We address this gap by introducing SIMPACT, the
SIMulation-oriented Persona and Action Capture Toolkit, a privacy respecting
framework for constructing behaviorally-grounded social media datasets suitable
for training agent models. We formulate next-action prediction as a task for
training and evaluating LLM-based agents and introduce metrics at both the
cluster and population levels to assess behavioral fidelity and stylistic
realism. As a concrete implementation, we release BluePrint, a large-scale
dataset built from public Bluesky data focused on political discourse.
BluePrint clusters anonymized users into personas of aggregated behaviours,
capturing authentic engagement patterns while safeguarding privacy through
pseudonymization and removal of personally identifiable information. The
dataset includes a sizable action set of 12 social media interaction types
(likes, replies, reposts, etc.), each instance tied to the posting activity
preceding it. This supports the development of agents that use
context-dependence, not only in the language, but also in the interaction
behaviours of social media to model social media users. By standardizing data
and evaluation protocols, SIMPACT provides a foundation for advancing rigorous,
ethically responsible social media simulations. BluePrint serves as both an
evaluation benchmark for political discourse modeling and a template for
building domain specific datasets to study challenges such as misinformation
and polarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified framework for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs that addresses load imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead through dynamic expert clustering, structured compression, and hierarchical routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the trilemma of load imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs.

Method: Uses dynamic expert clustering based on parameter and activation similarity, decomposes expert weights into shared base matrices and low-rank residual adapters, implements two-stage hierarchical routing, and employs heterogeneous precision with FP16 for shared bases and INT4 for residuals.

Result: Achieves 80% parameter reduction, 10-20% throughput improvement, and over 3x reduction in expert load variance while matching standard MoE model quality on GLUE and WikiText-103 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient, and memory-effective MoE LLMs.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load
imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a
unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression
to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering
procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter
and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic
embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's
architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each
cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely
low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per
group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage
hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to
specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and
the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision
scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled
with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption
to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our
framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total
parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and
lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates
that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient,
and memory-effective MoE LLMs.

TL;DR: Small language models (SLMs) with 7-17B parameters can match GPT-4o's performance as AI teaching assistants when using retrieval-augmented generation and proper prompting, while offering sustainability benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the development of AI teaching assistants using smaller, more sustainable language models that can provide curriculum-based guidance without relying on cloud infrastructure.

Method: Used retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline with eight SLMs (LLaMA 3.1, IBM Granite 3.3, Gemma 3) benchmarked against GPT-4o, employing proper prompting and targeted retrieval techniques.

Result: SLMs matched LLMs in delivering accurate, pedagogically aligned responses while offering significant sustainability benefits with lower computational and energy requirements.

Conclusion: SLMs are viable AI teaching assistants that enable cost-effective, privacy-preserving, and environmentally responsible personalized learning at scale on consumer-grade hardware.

Abstract: The adoption of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) in education
is still emerging. In this study, we explore the development and evaluation of
AI teaching assistants that provide curriculum-based guidance using a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline applied to selected open-source
small language models (SLMs). We benchmarked eight SLMs, including LLaMA 3.1,
IBM Granite 3.3, and Gemma 3 (7-17B parameters), against GPT-4o. Our findings
show that with proper prompting and targeted retrieval, SLMs can match LLMs in
delivering accurate, pedagogically aligned responses. Importantly, SLMs offer
significant sustainability benefits due to their lower computational and energy
requirements, enabling real-time use on consumer-grade hardware without
depending on cloud infrastructure. This makes them not only cost-effective and
privacy-preserving but also environmentally responsible, positioning them as
viable AI teaching assistants for educational institutions aiming to scale
personalized learning in a sustainable and energy-efficient manner.

TL;DR: mini-vec2vec is an efficient and robust linear alternative to vec2vec for aligning text embedding spaces without parallel data, offering orders of magnitude better efficiency while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: vec2vec provides near-perfect alignment but is expensive and unstable, creating a need for a simpler, more efficient, and robust alternative.

Method: Three-stage approach: tentative matching of pseudo-parallel embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement to learn a linear transformation mapping.

Result: Exceeds vec2vec by orders of magnitude in efficiency while matching or exceeding its alignment results, with high stability and interpretable algorithmic steps.

Conclusion: mini-vec2vec's stability, efficiency, and interpretability facilitate scaling and enable adoption in new domains and fields for text embedding alignment.

Abstract: We build upon vec2vec, a procedure designed to align text embedding spaces
without parallel data. vec2vec finds a near-perfect alignment, but it is
expensive and unstable. We present mini-vec2vec, a simple and efficient
alternative that requires substantially lower computational cost and is highly
robust. Moreover, the learned mapping is a linear transformation. Our method
consists of three main stages: a tentative matching of pseudo-parallel
embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement. Our linear
alternative exceeds the original instantiation of vec2vec by orders of
magnitude in efficiency, while matching or exceeding their results. The
method's stability and interpretable algorithmic steps facilitate scaling and
unlock new opportunities for adoption in new domains and fields.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMSQL is a cleaned and improved version of WikiSQL designed for modern LLMs, addressing structural and annotation issues in the original dataset to create a better benchmark for Text-to-SQL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WikiSQL had declined in usage due to various issues including case sensitivity inconsistencies, data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions, making it unsuitable for modern LLM-based Text-to-SQL research.

Method: Systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL through error classification and automated cleaning/re-annotation methods, creating a dataset with clean natural language questions and full SQL queries as plain text.

Result: Multiple LLMs (including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral 7B, gpt-oss 20B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen 2.5, OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1) were evaluated on the improved benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness for modern Text-to-SQL evaluation.

Conclusion: LLMSQL serves as an LLM-ready benchmark that provides clean data suitable for straightforward generation and evaluation of modern natural language-to-SQL models, unlike the original WikiSQL which was tailored for pointer-network models.

Abstract: Converting natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL) enables
non-expert users to interact with relational databases and has long been a
central task for natural language interfaces to data. While the WikiSQL dataset
played a key role in early NL2SQL research, its usage has declined due to
structural and annotation issues, including case sensitivity inconsistencies,
data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions. We present
LLMSQL, a systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL designed for the
LLM era. We classify these errors and implement automated methods for cleaning
and re-annotation. To assess the impact of these improvements, we evaluated
multiple large language models (LLMs), including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral
7B, gpt-oss 20B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen 2.5, OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1 and
others. Rather than serving as an update, LLMSQL is introduced as an LLM-ready
benchmark: unlike the original WikiSQL, tailored for pointer-network models
selecting tokens from input, LLMSQL provides clean natural language questions
and full SQL queries as plain text, enabling straightforward generation and
evaluation for modern natural language-to-SQL models.

*Dzmitry Pihulski,Jan Kocoń*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs with reasoning capabilities are more consistent and sensitive to ideological and cultural variations in assessing political offensiveness, while smaller models struggle with subtle distinctions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs assess offensiveness in political discourse when adopting specific political and cultural perspectives across different languages and contexts.

Method: Evaluated several LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3, Gemma, Mistral) using multilingual MD-Agreement dataset from 2020 US elections, prompting them to judge tweets as offensive/non-offensive from various political personas across English, Polish, and Russian contexts.

Result: Larger models with explicit reasoning abilities showed greater consistency and sensitivity to ideological and cultural variation, while smaller models often failed to capture subtle distinctions.

Conclusion: Reasoning capabilities significantly improve personalization and interpretability of offensiveness judgments, making them key for adapting LLMs to nuanced sociopolitical text classification across languages and ideologies.

Abstract: We explore how large language models (LLMs) assess offensiveness in political
discourse when prompted to adopt specific political and cultural perspectives.
Using a multilingual subset of the MD-Agreement dataset centered on tweets from
the 2020 US elections, we evaluate several recent LLMs - including DeepSeek-R1,
o4-mini, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3, Gemma, and Mistral - tasked with judging tweets
as offensive or non-offensive from the viewpoints of varied political personas
(far-right, conservative, centrist, progressive) across English, Polish, and
Russian contexts. Our results show that larger models with explicit reasoning
abilities (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini) are more consistent and sensitive to
ideological and cultural variation, while smaller models often fail to capture
subtle distinctions. We find that reasoning capabilities significantly improve
both the personalization and interpretability of offensiveness judgments,
suggesting that such mechanisms are key to adapting LLMs for nuanced
sociopolitical text classification across languages and ideologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic study of biases in spoken dialogue models (SDMs), examining how paralinguistic features like age, gender, and accent affect model outputs, particularly in multi-turn conversations with negative feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biases in spoken dialogue models remain largely unexplored despite known issues in text-based LLMs. Paralinguistic features combined with multi-turn conversations may exacerbate biases, with implications for fairness in decision-making and recommendation tasks.

Method: Systematically evaluated biases in speech LLMs using Group Unfairness Score (GUS) for decisions and similarity-based normalized statistics rate (SNSR) for recommendations. Tested both open-source (Qwen2.5-Omni, GLM-4-Voice) and closed-source models (GPT-4o Audio, Gemini-2.5-Flash) with multi-turn dialogues involving repeated negative feedback.

Result: Closed-source models generally exhibit lower bias, while open-source models are more sensitive to age and gender. Recommendation tasks tend to amplify cross-group disparities. Biased decisions may persist in multi-turn conversations.

Conclusion: This work provides foundational insights into biases in end-to-end spoken dialogue models and releases the FairDialogue dataset and evaluation code to facilitate further research towards fair and reliable audio-based interactive systems.

Abstract: While biases in large language models (LLMs), such as stereotypes and
cultural tendencies in outputs, have been examined and identified, their
presence and characteristics in spoken dialogue models (SDMs) with audio input
and output remain largely unexplored. Paralinguistic features, such as age,
gender, and accent, can affect model outputs; when compounded by multi-turn
conversations, these effects may exacerbate biases, with potential implications
for fairness in decision-making and recommendation tasks. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate biases in speech LLMs and study the impact of
multi-turn dialogues with repeated negative feedback. Bias is measured using
Group Unfairness Score (GUS) for decisions and similarity-based normalized
statistics rate (SNSR) for recommendations, across both open-source models like
Qwen2.5-Omni and GLM-4-Voice, as well as closed-source APIs such as GPT-4o
Audio and Gemini-2.5-Flash. Our analysis reveals that closed-source models
generally exhibit lower bias, while open-source models are more sensitive to
age and gender, and recommendation tasks tend to amplify cross-group
disparities. We found that biased decisions may persist in multi-turn
conversations. This work provides the first systematic study of biases in
end-to-end spoken dialogue models, offering insights towards fair and reliable
audio-based interactive systems. To facilitate further research, we release the
FairDialogue dataset and evaluation code.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study shows that abstract meaning representations exist in the language cortex, demonstrated by improved neural response predictions using aggregated vision embeddings from multiple generated images and enriched paraphrases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the human language system maintains abstract, form-independent meaning representations, addressing debates about the abstractness of semantic representations in the brain.

Method: Modeled neural responses to sentences using embeddings from vision and language models, aggregating across multiple generated images and paraphrases, and enriching paraphrases with contextual details.

Result: Aggregating across multiple generated images and paraphrases improved prediction accuracy of language cortex responses, with enriched paraphrases sometimes surpassing predictions based on original sentences.

Conclusion: The language cortex contains highly abstract, form-independent meaning representations that are richer and broader than those in language models.

Abstract: The human language system represents both linguistic forms and meanings, but
the abstractness of the meaning representations remains debated. Here, we
searched for abstract representations of meaning in the language cortex by
modeling neural responses to sentences using representations from vision and
language models. When we generate images corresponding to sentences and extract
vision model embeddings, we find that aggregating across multiple generated
images yields increasingly accurate predictions of language cortex responses,
sometimes rivaling large language models. Similarly, averaging embeddings
across multiple paraphrases of a sentence improves prediction accuracy compared
to any single paraphrase. Enriching paraphrases with contextual details that
may be implicit (e.g., augmenting "I had a pancake" to include details like
"maple syrup") further increases prediction accuracy, even surpassing
predictions based on the embedding of the original sentence, suggesting that
the language system maintains richer and broader semantic representations than
language models. Together, these results demonstrate the existence of highly
abstract, form-independent meaning representations within the language cortex.

*Guanghao Li,Zhihui Fu,Min Fang,Qibin Zhao,Ming Tang,Chun Yuan,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiffuSpec is a training-free framework that uses diffusion language models to generate multi-token drafts in a single forward pass for speculative decoding, achieving up to 3x speedup over autoregressive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive decoding in large language models increases latency due to serial token generation, and existing speculative decoding methods still rely on autoregressive drafters that limit wall-clock gains.

Method: Uses pretrained diffusion language models to produce multi-token drafts in one forward pass, with causal-consistency path search to extract left-to-right paths from token lattices and adaptive draft-length controller to adjust proposal sizes.

Result: Achieves up to 3x wall-clock speedup across benchmarks compared to autoregressive drafters.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based drafting presents a robust alternative to autoregressive drafters for speculative decoding, significantly improving inference speed without requiring training.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale up, accuracy improves, but the
autoregressive (AR) nature of decoding increases latency since each token
requires a serial forward pass. Speculative decoding addresses this by
employing a fast drafter to propose multi-token drafts, which are then verified
in parallel by the target model. However, many deployments still rely on AR
drafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the
drafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that
uses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts
in a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR
verifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning,
parallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally
highest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right
path. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a
speed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two
practical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this
lattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and
(ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size
based on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length. Across
benchmarks, DiffuSpec yields up to 3x wall-clock speedup, establishing
diffusion-based drafting as a robust alternative to autoregressive drafters for

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emission-GPT is a knowledge-enhanced LLM agent for atmospheric emissions domain, built on 10,000+ documents, enabling natural language interaction for emissions data analysis, querying, visualization, and emission factor recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current emission knowledge is fragmented and specialized, making it difficult for non-experts to access and interpret emissions data efficiently, hindering research and management efforts.

Method: Built on curated knowledge base with prompt engineering and question completion; supports interactive natural language analysis of emissions data, including querying inventories, source contribution analysis, and emission factor recommendations.

Result: Case study in Guangdong Province showed successful extraction of key insights like point source distributions and sectoral trends directly from raw data using simple prompts.

Conclusion: Emission-GPT's modular architecture enables automation of manual workflows and serves as a foundational tool for next-generation emission inventory development and scenario-based assessment.

Abstract: Improving air quality and addressing climate change relies on accurate
understanding and analysis of air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions.
However, emission-related knowledge is often fragmented and highly specialized,
while existing methods for accessing and compiling emissions data remain
inefficient. These issues hinder the ability of non-experts to interpret
emissions information, posing challenges to research and management. To address
this, we present Emission-GPT, a knowledge-enhanced large language model agent
tailored for the atmospheric emissions domain. Built on a curated knowledge
base of over 10,000 documents (including standards, reports, guidebooks, and
peer-reviewed literature), Emission-GPT integrates prompt engineering and
question completion to support accurate domain-specific question answering.
Emission-GPT also enables users to interactively analyze emissions data via
natural language, such as querying and visualizing inventories, analyzing
source contributions, and recommending emission factors for user-defined
scenarios. A case study in Guangdong Province demonstrates that Emission-GPT
can extract key insights--such as point source distributions and sectoral
trends--directly from raw data with simple prompts. Its modular and extensible
architecture facilitates automation of traditionally manual workflows,
positioning Emission-GPT as a foundational tool for next-generation emission
inventory development and scenario-based assessment.

*Mingze Zhong,Meng Fang,Zijing Shi,Yuxuan Huang,Shunfeng Zheng,Yali Du,Ling Chen,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether Spiral of Silence dynamics can emerge in LLM collectives through statistical language generation, finding that history and persona signals together create strong majority dominance similar to human SoS patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if Spiral of Silence theory, originally developed for human societies, can manifest in LLM collectives despite the absence of human psychological mechanisms.

Method: Proposed an evaluation framework with four controlled conditions varying History and Persona signals, using trend tests (Mann-Kendall, Spearman's rank) and concentration measures (kurtosis, interquartile range) to assess opinion dynamics.

Result: Experiments showed: history+persona together produce strong majority dominance replicating SoS patterns; history alone induces strong anchoring; persona alone fosters diverse but uncorrelated opinions without SoS dynamics.

Conclusion: SoS dynamics can emerge in LLM collectives through statistical language generation, bridging computational sociology and responsible AI design, highlighting the need to monitor emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.

Abstract: The Spiral of Silence (SoS) theory holds that individuals with minority views
often refrain from speaking out for fear of social isolation, enabling majority
positions to dominate public discourse. When the 'agents' are large language
models (LLMs), however, the classical psychological explanation is not directly
applicable, since SoS was developed for human societies. This raises a central
question: can SoS-like dynamics nevertheless emerge from purely statistical
language generation in LLM collectives? We propose an evaluation framework for
examining SoS in LLM agents. Specifically, we consider four controlled
conditions that systematically vary the availability of 'History' and 'Persona'
signals. Opinion dynamics are assessed using trend tests such as Mann-Kendall
and Spearman's rank, along with concentration measures including kurtosis and
interquartile range. Experiments across open-source and closed-source models
show that history and persona together produce strong majority dominance and
replicate SoS patterns; history signals alone induce strong anchoring; and
persona signals alone foster diverse but uncorrelated opinions, indicating that
without historical anchoring, SoS dynamics cannot emerge. The work bridges
computational sociology and responsible AI design, highlighting the need to
monitor and mitigate emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.

### [88] [ChunkLLM: A Lightweight Pluggable Framework for Accelerating LLMs Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02361)
*Haojie Ouyang,Jianwei Lv,Lei Ren,Chen Wei,Xiaojie Wang,Fangxiang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChunkLLM is a lightweight training framework that addresses Transformer's quadratic complexity by using QK Adapters for feature compression and chunk attention, and Chunk Adapter for boundary detection, achieving significant speedup while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models suffer from computational inefficiency due to quadratic self-attention complexity. Existing methods have issues with semantic incompleteness or poor training-inference efficiency.

Method: Proposes ChunkLLM with two components: QK Adapter (feature compression and chunk attention) and Chunk Adapter (chunk boundary detection). Uses attention distillation for training QK Adapter and freezes backbone parameters during training.

Result: Achieves comparable performance on short-text benchmarks, maintains 98.64% performance on long-context benchmarks with 48.58% KV cache retention, and achieves 4.48x speedup on 120K long texts.

Conclusion: ChunkLLM effectively addresses computational inefficiency in Transformers while preserving performance, making it suitable for both short and long text processing.

Abstract: Transformer-based large models excel in natural language processing and
computer vision, but face severe computational inefficiencies due to the
self-attention's quadratic complexity with input tokens. Recently, researchers
have proposed a series of methods based on block selection and compression to
alleviate this problem, but they either have issues with semantic
incompleteness or poor training-inference efficiency. To comprehensively
address these challenges, we propose ChunkLLM, a lightweight and pluggable
training framework. Specifically, we introduce two components: QK Adapter
(Q-Adapter and K-Adapter) and Chunk Adapter. The former is attached to each
Transformer layer, serving dual purposes of feature compression and chunk
attention acquisition. The latter operates at the bottommost layer of the
model, functioning to detect chunk boundaries by leveraging contextual semantic
information. During the training phase, the parameters of the backbone remain
frozen, with only the QK Adapter and Chunk Adapter undergoing training.
Notably, we design an attention distillation method for training the QK
Adapter, which enhances the recall rate of key chunks. During the inference
phase, chunk selection is triggered exclusively when the current token is
detected as a chunk boundary, thereby accelerating model inference.
Experimental evaluations are conducted on a diverse set of long-text and
short-text benchmark datasets spanning multiple tasks. ChunkLLM not only
attains comparable performance on short-text benchmarks but also maintains
98.64% of the performance on long-context benchmarks while preserving a 48.58%
key-value cache retention rate. Particularly, ChunkLLM attains a maximum
speedup of 4.48x in comparison to the vanilla Transformer in the processing of
120K long texts.

### [89] [A Cross-Lingual Analysis of Bias in Large Language Models Using Romanian History](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02362)
*Matei-Iulian Cocu,Răzvan-Cosmin Cristia,Adrian Marius Dumitran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines biases in Large Language Models by testing their responses to controversial Romanian historical questions across languages and response formats, revealing significant inconsistencies in model outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLM biases in historical contexts, recognizing that history is often presented through altered cultural perspectives and that LLMs trained on potentially biased datasets may lack neutrality.

Method: Three-stage research process testing LLMs on controversial Romanian historical questions across languages and contexts, comparing binary responses with numeric scale responses to examine response stability.

Result: Binary response stability is relatively high but varies by language; models often flip stance across languages or formats; numeric ratings frequently diverge from initial binary choices; most consistent models are not always the most accurate or neutral.

Conclusion: LLMs show predisposition to inconsistencies in historical responses, with variations influenced by language context and response format, highlighting the need for awareness of model biases in historical applications.

Abstract: In this case study, we select a set of controversial Romanian historical
questions and ask multiple Large Language Models to answer them across
languages and contexts, in order to assess their biases. Besides being a study
mainly performed for educational purposes, the motivation also lies in the
recognition that history is often presented through altered perspectives,
primarily influenced by the culture and ideals of a state, even through large
language models. Since they are often trained on certain data sets that may
present certain ambiguities, the lack of neutrality is subsequently instilled
in users. The research process was carried out in three stages, to confirm the
idea that the type of response expected can influence, to a certain extent, the
response itself; after providing an affirmative answer to some given question,
an LLM could shift its way of thinking after being asked the same question
again, but being told to respond with a numerical value of a scale. Results
show that binary response stability is relatively high but far from perfect and
varies by language. Models often flip stance across languages or between
formats; numeric ratings frequently diverge from the initial binary choice, and
the most consistent models are not always those judged most accurate or
neutral. Our research brings to light the predisposition of models to such
inconsistencies, within a specific contextualization of the language for the
question asked.

### [90] [Beyond Manuals and Tasks: Instance-Level Context Learning for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02369)
*Kuntai Cai,Juncheng Liu,Xianglin Yang,Zhaojie Niu,Xiaokui Xiao,Xing Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) to address the gap in LLM agents' context by capturing verifiable, reusable facts about specific environment instances, improving task success rates significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents rely on environment manuals and task guidance but lack instance-level context (e.g., object locations, recipes), leading to failures in complex tasks where precise, persistent facts are crucial.

Method: Proposes a task-agnostic ILCL method using guided exploration with a TODO forest for action prioritization and a plan-act-extract loop to efficiently gather and validate facts, producing reusable context documents.

Result: Experiments in TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter show substantial improvements: ReAct's success rate in TextWorld increased from 37% to 95%, and IGE improved from 81% to 95%, with enhanced efficiency.

Conclusion: ILCL transforms one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, complementing existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM agents.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents typically receive two kinds of context: (i)
environment-level manuals that define interaction interfaces and global rules,
and (ii) task-level guidance or demonstrations tied to specific goals. In this
work, we identify a crucial but overlooked third type of context,
instance-level context, which consists of verifiable and reusable facts tied to
a specific environment instance, such as object locations, crafting recipes,
and local rules. We argue that the absence of instance-level context is a
common source of failure for LLM agents in complex tasks, as success often
depends not only on reasoning over global rules or task prompts but also on
making decisions based on precise and persistent facts. Acquiring such context
requires more than memorization: the challenge lies in efficiently exploring,
validating, and formatting these facts under tight interaction budgets. We
formalize this problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduce
our task-agnostic method to solve it. Our method performs a guided exploration,
using a compact TODO forest to intelligently prioritize its next actions and a
lightweight plan-act-extract loop to execute them. This process automatically
produces a high-precision context document that is reusable across many
downstream tasks and agents, thereby amortizing the initial exploration cost.
Experiments across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter demonstrate consistent
gains in both success and efficiency: for instance, ReAct's mean success rate
in TextWorld rises from 37% to 95%, while IGE improves from 81% to 95%. By
transforming one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, our
method complements existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM
agents.

### [91] [Training Dynamics of Parametric and In-Context Knowledge Utilization in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02370)
*Minsung Kim,Dong-Kyum Kim,Jea Kwon,Nakyeong Yang,Kyomin Jung,Meeyoung Cha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a controlled study on how training conditions affect language models' ability to arbitrate between parametric knowledge (from pretraining) and in-context knowledge (from retrieval). The research shows that certain "non-ideal" training properties like intra-document repetition, inconsistent information, and distributional skew actually help models develop robust knowledge arbitration strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face conflicts between in-context knowledge from retrieval and parametric knowledge from pretraining. Current models either accept external knowledge uncritically (making them vulnerable to misinformation) or adhere rigidly to parametric knowledge (missing retrieval benefits). There's a lack of systematic understanding of what shapes knowledge-arbitration strategies during training, risking wasted computational resources.

Method: The authors conducted the first controlled study by training transformer-based language models on a synthetic biographies corpus while systematically controlling various training conditions. They examined how different training conditions influence models' use of parametric and in-context knowledge and their arbitration strategies.

Result: Experiments revealed that intra-document repetition of facts fosters development of both parametric and in-context capabilities. Training on corpora containing inconsistent information or distributional skew encourages models to develop robust strategies for leveraging both types of knowledge. These "non-ideal" properties are actually important for learning robust arbitration.

Conclusion: Rather than viewing properties like repetition, inconsistency, and distributional skew as artifacts to remove, they are important for learning robust knowledge arbitration. These insights provide concrete, empirical guidance for pretraining models that can harmoniously integrate parametric and in-context knowledge.

Abstract: Large language models often encounter conflicts between in-context knowledge
retrieved at inference time and parametric knowledge acquired during
pretraining. Models that accept external knowledge uncritically are vulnerable
to misinformation, whereas models that adhere rigidly to parametric knowledge
fail to benefit from retrieval. Despite the widespread adoption of
retrieval-augmented generation, we still lack a systematic understanding of
what shapes knowledge-arbitration strategies during training. This gap risks
producing pretrained models with undesirable arbitration behaviors and,
consequently, wasting substantial computational resources after the pretraining
budget has already been spent. To address this problem, we present the first
controlled study of how training conditions influence models' use of in-context
and parametric knowledge, and how they arbitrate between them. We train
transformer-based language models on a synthetic biographies corpus while
systematically controlling various conditions. Our experiments reveal that
intra-document repetition of facts fosters the development of both parametric
and in-context capabilities. Moreover, training on a corpus that contains
inconsistent information or distributional skew encourages models to develop
robust strategies for leveraging parametric and in-context knowledge. Rather
than viewing these non-ideal properties as artifacts to remove, our results
indicate that they are important for learning robust arbitration. These
insights offer concrete, empirical guidance for pretraining models that
harmoniously integrate parametric and in-context knowledge.

*Hadi Pouransari,David Grangier,C Thomas,Michael Kirchhof,Oncel Tuzel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small language models augmented with hierarchical parametric memory banks achieve comparable performance to larger models by storing world knowledge in memory parameters while keeping the core model small for reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models require scaling parameters to store all world knowledge, which is inefficient as only a fraction is used per prompt and impractical for edge devices with limited memory and compute.

Method: Memory-augmented architecture with small language models that access large hierarchical parametric memory banks. During pretraining and inference, fetch context-dependent memory blocks and add them to the model.

Result: A 160M-parameter model with 18M-parameter memory from a 4.6B memory bank performs comparably to regular models with over 2x parameters. Hierarchical feed-forward memories work robustly across transformer architectures.

Conclusion: Memory-augmented architectures enable efficient knowledge storage and retrieval, allowing small models to achieve performance comparable to much larger models while being practical for edge devices.

Abstract: The impressive performance gains of modern language models currently rely on
scaling parameters: larger models store more world knowledge and reason better.
Yet compressing all world knowledge into parameters is unnecessary, as only a
fraction is used per prompt, and impractical for edge devices with limited
inference-time memory and compute. We address this shortcoming by a
memory-augmented architecture and a pretraining strategy aligned with existing
hardware paradigms. We introduce small language models that access large
hierarchical parametric memory banks encoding world knowledge. During
pretraining and inference, we fetch a small, context-dependent memory block and
add it to the model. Our pretraining learns to store long-tail world knowledge
in the memory parameters, while the small language model acts as an anchor
capturing common knowledge and general reasoning abilities. Through
trillion-token-scale experiments, we show significant gains: a 160M-parameters
model augmented with an 18M-parameters memory fetched from a 4.6B memory bank
obtains comparable performance to a regular model with more than 2x the
parameters. Through extensive experiments, we study the optimal type and size
of parametric memories in transformers, scaling them to over 21B parameters. We
find that our proposed hierarchical feed-forward memories work robustly across
transformer architectures, whether added during pretraining or post-hoc.

TL;DR: A novel method for selecting the best response from multiple LLMs using calibrated log-likelihood scores, improving performance by 3-5% across various benchmarks without requiring costly external verifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for selecting reliable LLM responses depend on costly external verifiers, human evaluators, or self-consistency techniques that require multiple samples from a single model. Multi-LLM systems produce diverse responses but often underperform compared to single LLM self-consistency.

Method: A principled and computationally efficient method that selects the best response from multiple different LLMs using a calibrated log-likelihood score, implicitly leveraging the inherent knowledge and confidence of these models.

Result: Improvements of approximately 4%, 3%, and 5% across both debate (multi-round LLM discussions) and non-debate (Best-of-N with multiple LLMs) settings on GSM8K, MMLU (6 subsets), and ARC datasets respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed calibrated log-likelihood method effectively selects the best responses from multiple LLMs, outperforming existing approaches while being computationally efficient and not requiring external verification resources.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities, yet
selecting the most reliable response from multiple LLMs remains a challenge,
particularly in resource-constrained settings. Existing approaches often depend
on costly external verifiers, human evaluators, or self-consistency techniques
that require multiple samples from a single model. While multi-LLM systems
produce more diverse responses than single models and thus have greater
potential, they often underperform compared to single LLM self-consistency. We
propose a principled, novel and computationally efficient method to select the
best response from multiple different LLMs using a calibrated log-likelihood
score, implicitly leveraging the inherent knowledge and confidence of these
models. Our method demonstrates improvements of approx. 4%, 3%, and 5% across
both debate (multi-round LLM discussions) and non-debate (Best-of-N with

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A rule-driven routing framework that intelligently selects between database and document retrieval for LLM question answering, achieving better accuracy with moderate computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with domain-specific QA requiring accurate, up-to-date information. While RAG helps, existing systems focus on unstructured documents and overlook relational databases which provide precise, timely, and efficiently queryable factual information.

Method: Proposes a rule-driven routing framework with: routing agent scoring augmentation paths using explicit rules, rule-making expert agent refining rules using QA feedback, and path-level meta-cache reusing routing decisions for similar queries.

Result: Experiments on three QA benchmarks show the framework consistently outperforms static strategies and learned routing baselines, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining moderate computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed rule-driven routing framework effectively balances database and document retrieval for LLM question answering, demonstrating superior performance through intelligent source selection and adaptive rule refinement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on general
Question Answering (QA), yet they often struggle in domain-specific scenarios
where accurate and up-to-date information is required. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by enriching LLMs with external
knowledge, but existing systems primarily rely on unstructured documents, while
largely overlooking relational databases, which provide precise, timely, and
efficiently queryable factual information, serving as indispensable
infrastructure in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific research.
Motivated by this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis that reveals three
central observations: (i) databases and documents offer complementary strengths
across queries, (ii) naively combining both sources introduces noise and cost
without consistent accuracy gains, and (iii) selecting the most suitable source
for each query is crucial to balance effectiveness and efficiency. We further
observe that query types show consistent regularities in their alignment with
retrieval paths, suggesting that routing decisions can be effectively guided by
systematic rules that capture these patterns. Building on these insights, we
propose a rule-driven routing framework. A routing agent scores candidate
augmentation paths based on explicit rules and selects the most suitable one; a
rule-making expert agent refines the rules over time using QA feedback to
maintain adaptability; and a path-level meta-cache reuses past routing
decisions for semantically similar queries to reduce latency and cost.
Experiments on three QA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms static strategies and learned routing baselines, achieving higher
accuracy while maintaining moderate computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the knowledge updating mechanism of LLMs, which remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and small-scale evaluation. The paper aims to investigate whether LLMs update knowledge similarly to humans and how editing differs from unlearning as training data increases.

Method: Proposes KnowledgeSmith framework that casts editing and unlearning as instances of constrained optimization problems. Uses an automatic dataset generator providing structured interventions across multiple graph levels and data scales to study how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal nuanced insights: LLMs do not exhibit similar updating patterns as humans for different knowledge levels, and there exists a consistency-capacity trade-off in knowledge updating mechanisms.

Conclusion: The findings offer suggestions for designing more reliable and scalable knowledge updating strategies for LLMs, highlighting the importance of understanding knowledge propagation and consistency mechanisms.

Abstract: Knowledge editing and machine unlearning are two popular approaches for large
language models (LLMs) to stay up-to-date. However, the knowledge updating
mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and
small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying
certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data
increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to
systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing
and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we
propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions
across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of
how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge.
Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation,
plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show
that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of
knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our
findings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable
strategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM performance for NL-to-SQL translation varies significantly across databases due to domain-specific vocabulary, and existing benchmarks rely on unrealistic ad-hoc query-specific textual hints.

Method: Systematic framework for associating structured domain statements at database level, using substring-level match for retrieving relevant domain statements given user queries.

Result: Evaluation on 11 realistic DB schemas across 5 LLMs shows DB-level structured domain statements are more practical and accurate than ad-hoc query-specific textual statements, and substring-based retrieval provides significantly higher accuracy than other approaches.

Conclusion: Database-level structured domain statements with substring-based retrieval offer a more effective approach for improving LLM performance in NL-to-SQL translation across diverse domains.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) for translating Natural
Language (NL) queries into SQL varies significantly across databases (DBs). NL
queries are often expressed using a domain specific vocabulary, and mapping
these to the correct SQL requires an understanding of the embedded domain
expressions, their relationship to the DB schema structure. Existing benchmarks
rely on unrealistic, ad-hoc query specific textual hints for expressing domain
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for associating
structured domain statements at the database level. We present retrieval of
relevant structured domain statements given a user query using sub-string level
match. We evaluate on eleven realistic DB schemas covering diverse domains
across five open-source and proprietary LLMs and demonstrate that (1) DB level
structured domain statements are more practical and accurate than existing
ad-hoc query specific textual domain statements, and (2) Our sub-string match
based retrieval of relevant domain statements provides significantly higher
accuracy than other retrieval approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether explicit sensory prompting can surface latent multimodal structure in text-only LLMs and bring them into closer representational alignment with specialist vision and audio encoders.

Method: Using sensory prompts (e.g., 'see' or 'hear') to cue text-only LLMs to resolve next-token predictions as if conditioned on latent visual or auditory evidence, without actually supplying such evidence.

Result: Lightweight prompt engineering reliably activates modality-appropriate representations in purely text-trained LLMs, demonstrating latent multimodal structure.

Conclusion: Text-only LLMs contain implicit multimodal representations that can be surfaced through simple sensory prompting, enabling closer alignment with specialist encoders.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained purely on text ostensibly lack any
direct perceptual experience, yet their internal representations are implicitly
shaped by multimodal regularities encoded in language. We test the hypothesis
that explicit sensory prompting can surface this latent structure, bringing a
text-only LLM into closer representational alignment with specialist vision and
audio encoders. When a sensory prompt tells the model to 'see' or 'hear', it
cues the model to resolve its next-token predictions as if they were
conditioned on latent visual or auditory evidence that is never actually
supplied. Our findings reveal that lightweight prompt engineering can reliably
activate modality-appropriate representations in purely text-trained LLMs.

Result: Transformers learn all subgrammars in parallel (unlike children), subgrammar pretraining helps smaller models, pretrained models develop grammar-aligned representations, and models struggle with deep recursion.

Conclusion: PCFGs provide a versatile testbed for studying language model learning dynamics, revealing fundamental challenges in neural network representation of hierarchical syntax.

Abstract: We introduce a new framework for understanding how language models acquire
syntax. While large models achieve impressive results, little is known about
their learning dynamics. Our approach starts with the observation that most
domains of interest, such as natural language syntax, coding languages,
arithmetic problems, are captured by probabilistic context-free grammars
(PCFGs). We study the learning dynamics of small models trained on synthetic
languages generated from PCFGs, enabling precise control over grammar
complexity, recursion depth, and subgrammar structure. We prove several
general, recursive formulae for the training loss and Kullback-Leibler
divergence over the subgrammar structure of a PCFG. Empirically, we find that
unlike children, who first master simple substructures before progressing to
more complex constructions, transformers reduce loss across all subgrammars in
parallel. We further show that subgrammar pretraining can improve the final
loss for smaller models, and that pretrained models develop internal
representations more aligned with the grammar's substructure. Finally, we
demonstrate that models struggle with deeper recursive structures (a limitation
even of large language models), revealing fundamental challenges in how neural
networks represent hierarchical syntax. Overall, our work initiates the study
of the learning dynamics of transformers on PCFGs as a versatile testbed for
probing learning in language models, opening a research direction with many
open questions.

### [100] [Hierarchical Semantic Retrieval with Cobweb](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02539)
*Anant Gupta,Karthik Singaravadivelan,Zekun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cobweb organizes sentence embeddings into a hierarchical prototype tree for document retrieval, providing multi-granular relevance signals and transparent retrieval paths while maintaining competitive performance and improved robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural document retrieval treats corpora as flat vector clouds, underusing corpus structure and providing opaque explanations. The paper aims to leverage hierarchical organization for better retrieval with interpretability.

Method: Uses Cobweb framework to organize sentence embeddings into prototype trees, with internal nodes as concept prototypes. Implements two inference approaches: generalized best-first search and lightweight path-sum ranker. Evaluates with encoder (BERT/T5) and decoder (GPT-2) representations on MS MARCO and QQP datasets.

Result: Cobweb matches dot product search performance on strong encoder embeddings while remaining robust when kNN degrades. With GPT-2 vectors, dot product performance collapses but Cobweb still retrieves relevant results. Provides competitive effectiveness, improved robustness to embedding quality, scalability, and interpretable retrieval.

Conclusion: Cobweb provides a hierarchical approach to document retrieval that maintains competitive performance while offering improved robustness and interpretability through hierarchical prototypes and transparent retrieval paths.

Abstract: Neural document retrieval often treats a corpus as a flat cloud of vectors
scored at a single granularity, leaving corpus structure underused and
explanations opaque. We use Cobweb--a hierarchy-aware framework--to organize
sentence embeddings into a prototype tree and rank documents via coarse-to-fine
traversal. Internal nodes act as concept prototypes, providing multi-granular
relevance signals and a transparent rationale through retrieval paths. We
instantiate two inference approaches: a generalized best-first search and a
lightweight path-sum ranker. We evaluate our approaches on MS MARCO and QQP
with encoder (e.g., BERT/T5) and decoder (GPT-2) representations. Our results
show that our retrieval approaches match the dot product search on strong
encoder embeddings while remaining robust when kNN degrades: with GPT-2
vectors, dot product performance collapses whereas our approaches still
retrieve relevant results. Overall, our experiments suggest that Cobweb
provides competitive effectiveness, improved robustness to embedding quality,
scalability, and interpretable retrieval via hierarchical prototypes.

### [101] [Knowledge-Graph Based RAG System Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02549)
*Sicheng Dong,Vahid Zolfaghari,Nenad Petrovic,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a knowledge graph (KG)-based evaluation framework for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, extending the RAGAS tool to enable multi-hop reasoning and semantic community clustering for more comprehensive scoring metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluation metrics struggle to effectively capture key features of modern LLM-generated content that exhibits high fluency and naturalness, making RAG system evaluation challenging.

Method: Extended the RAGAS framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm that incorporates multi-hop reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive scoring metrics.

Result: The KG-based evaluation method shows better correlation with human judgments compared to RAGAS scores and demonstrates higher sensitivity to subtle semantic differences in generated outputs.

Conclusion: The proposed KG-based evaluation framework provides deeper understanding of RAG systems and more nuanced performance assessment, with identified challenges and future research directions for RAG evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) has become a significant research focus and is
utilized in various fields, such as text generation and dialog systems. One of
the most essential applications of LLM is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),
which greatly enhances generated content's reliability and relevance. However,
evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation
metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern
LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness.
Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended
this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop
reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive
scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we
gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on
their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare
its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to
assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In
addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based
evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated
outputs. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in evaluating RAG systems and
highlight potential directions for future research.

*Tolúl\d{o}pé Ògúnrèmí,Christopher D. Manning,Dan Jurafsky,Karen Livescu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how modality adapters in spoken language models transform speech representations, finding two strategies: meaning-based interlingua for Whisper-based models and phonetic-based representation for other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how modality adapters transform speech encoder outputs into representations that large language models can process, as this crucial component is poorly understood despite its importance in spoken language models.

Method: Examined modality adapter outputs in three SLMs (SALMONN, Qwen2-Audio, Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct) by finding the nearest decoder LM token to each MA representation to analyze the transformation strategy.

Result: Found two distinct strategies: Whisper-based models use an English-based interlingua representing meaning, enabling cross-lingual understanding, while other models represent phonetics using English words.

Conclusion: The representation strategy depends on the speech encoder's training objective - speech recognition-only encoders produce phonetic representations, while translation-trained encoders produce meaning-based interlingua.

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) that integrate speech with large language
models (LMs) rely on modality adapters (MAs) to map the output of speech
encoders to a representation that is understandable to the decoder LM. Yet we
know very little about how these crucial MAs transform representations. Here we
examine the MA output representation in three SLMs (SALMONN, Qwen2-Audio and
Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct). By finding the nearest decoder LM token to an MA
representation, we uncover two strategies for MA representations. For models
using a Whisper encoder, MAs appear to represent the meaning of the input using
an English-based interlingua, allowing them to handle languages unseen in
instruction tuning. For models that don't, like Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct, MAs
instead represent the phonetics of the input, but expressed with English words.
We hypothesise that which arises depends on whether the speech encoder is
trained only for speech recognition or also for translation.

### [103] [Evaluation Framework for Highlight Explanations of Context Utilisation in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02629)
*Jingyi Sun,Pepa Atanasova,Sagnik Ray Choudhury,Sekh Mainul Islam,Isabelle Augenstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first gold standard evaluation framework for highlight explanations (HEs) in assessing context utilization by language models, evaluating four HE methods across various scenarios and finding MechLight performs best but all methods struggle with long contexts and positional biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models lack transparency in context utilization - users cannot determine whether models use parametric memory or provided context, nor identify which specific context pieces inform responses. Highlight explanations offer a solution but no existing work evaluates their effectiveness in accurately explaining context attribution.

Method: Introduced a gold standard HE evaluation framework using controlled test cases with known ground-truth context usage. Evaluated four HE methods (three established techniques and MechLight, a mechanistic interpretability approach adapted for this task) across four context scenarios, four datasets, and five language models.

Result: MechLight performed best across all context scenarios. However, all methods struggled with longer contexts and exhibited positional biases, revealing fundamental challenges in explanation accuracy.

Conclusion: There are significant challenges in delivering reliable context utilization explanations at scale, requiring new approaches to address limitations with long contexts and positional biases in highlight explanation methods.

Abstract: Context utilisation, the ability of Language Models (LMs) to incorporate
relevant information from the provided context when generating responses,
remains largely opaque to users, who cannot determine whether models draw from
parametric memory or provided context, nor identify which specific context
pieces inform the response. Highlight explanations (HEs) offer a natural
solution as they can point the exact context pieces and tokens that influenced
model outputs. However, no existing work evaluates their effectiveness in
accurately explaining context utilisation. We address this gap by introducing
the first gold standard HE evaluation framework for context attribution, using
controlled test cases with known ground-truth context usage, which avoids the
limitations of existing indirect proxy evaluations. To demonstrate the
framework's broad applicability, we evaluate four HE methods -- three
established techniques and MechLight, a mechanistic interpretability approach
we adapt for this task -- across four context scenarios, four datasets, and
five LMs. Overall, we find that MechLight performs best across all context
scenarios. However, all methods struggle with longer contexts and exhibit
positional biases, pointing to fundamental challenges in explanation accuracy
that require new approaches to deliver reliable context utilisation
explanations at scale.

### [104] [Mind the Gap: Linguistic Divergence and Adaptation Strategies in Human-LLM Assistant vs. Human-Human Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02645)
*Fulei Zhang,Zhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Users communicate differently with LLM chatbots vs human agents, showing differences in grammar, politeness, and vocabulary. Training on human-human data alone is insufficient, but data augmentation helps models adapt better than inference-time reformulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how user communication styles differ between LLM chatbots and human agents, and address the gap where models trained on human-human data may not work well with actual chatbot deployment.

Method: Analyzed user communication differences, then tested two strategies: data augmentation during post-training and inference-time message reformulation.

Result: Found significant differences in grammatical fluency, politeness, and lexical diversity. Data augmentation with stylistically diverse datasets worked better than inference-time reformulation.

Conclusion: Models need training on diverse communication styles to handle post-launch user behavior changes, improving LLM-user interaction experiences.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in customer-facing
applications, a critical yet underexplored question is how users communicate
differently with LLM chatbots compared to human agent. In this study, we
present empirical evidence that users adopt distinct communication styles when
users interact with chatbots versus human agents. Our analysis reveals
significant differences in grammatical fluency, politeness, and lexical
diversity in user language between the two settings. These findings suggest
that models trained exclusively on human-human interaction data may not
adequately accommodate the communication style shift that occurs once an LLM
chatbot is deployed. To enhance LLM robustness to post-launch communication
style changes, we experimented with two strategies: (1) data augmentation
during the post-training phase and (2) inference-time user message
reformulation. Our results indicate that models trained on stylistically
diverse datasets significantly outperform those trained exclusively on original
or stylistically uniform datasets, while inference-time reformulation proved
less effective. These insights help us to better adapt our models for improved
LLM-user interaction experiences.

*Rui Qi,Zhibo Man,Yufeng Chen,Fengran Mo,Jinan Xu,Kaiyu Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SoT is a training-free method that improves multilingual reasoning by converting language-specific semantics into language-agnostic structured representations through multi-step transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with multilingual reasoning tasks due to resource constraints that prevent effective reasoning transfer to non-high-resource languages.

Method: Structured-of-Thought (SoT) uses Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge Transformation to convert semantic information into structured representations, guiding LLMs toward consistent reasoning across languages.

Result: SoT outperforms strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks across various LLM backbones and can be integrated with other training-free strategies for further improvements.

Conclusion: SoT effectively enhances multilingual reasoning by transforming language-specific information into structured representations, enabling more sophisticated understanding and consistent reasoning across different languages.

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to engage in
complex reasoning tasks through deep thinking. However, the capacity of
reasoning has not been successfully transferred to non-high-resource languages
due to resource constraints, which struggles with multilingual reasoning tasks.
To this end, we propose Structured-of-Thought (SoT), a training-free method
that improves the performance on multilingual reasoning through a multi-step
transformation: Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge
Transformation. The SoT method converts language-specific semantic information
into language-agnostic structured representations, enabling the models to
understand the query in different languages more sophisticated. Besides, SoT
effectively guides LLMs toward more concentrated reasoning to maintain
consistent underlying reasoning pathways when handling cross-lingual variations
in expression. Experimental results demonstrate that SoT outperforms several
strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks when adapting to
various backbones of LLMs. It can also be integrated with other training-free
strategies for further improvements. Our code is available at

*Yavuz Bakman,Sungmin Kang,Zhiqi Huang,Duygu Nur Yaldiz,Catarina G. Belém,Chenyang Zhu,Anoop Kumar,Alfy Samuel,Salman Avestimehr,Daben Liu,Sai Praneeth Karimireddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a theoretically grounded approach for uncertainty quantification in contextual question answering, focusing on epistemic uncertainty through semantic feature gaps between the given model and an idealized model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current uncertainty quantification research has focused on closed-book factual QA, while contextual QA remains unexplored despite its importance in real-world applications.

Method: The authors introduce a token-level uncertainty measure based on cross-entropy, decompose it to isolate epistemic uncertainty, and approximate the true distribution using an idealized model. They identify three key semantic features (context-reliance, context comprehension, and honesty) and extract them using a top-down interpretability approach with minimal labeled data.

Result: Experiments on multiple QA benchmarks show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to 13-point PRR improvement with negligible inference overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively quantifies epistemic uncertainty in contextual QA by identifying semantic feature gaps and outperforms existing approaches across various settings.

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) research has primarily focused on closed-book
factual question answering (QA), while contextual QA remains unexplored,
despite its importance in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on UQ
for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to
quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic,
token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the
predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution.
By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate
the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive
an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as
semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to
the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA
task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance
(using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context
comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty
(avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we
extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and
ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA
benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that
our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised
(sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a
13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead.

*Yubo Li,Ramayya Krishnan,Rema Padman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first survival analysis of conversational AI robustness, analyzing 36,951 conversation turns across 9 LLMs to model failure as a time-to-event process, revealing that abrupt semantic drift increases failure risk while gradual drift is protective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments, failing to capture temporal dynamics of conversational degradation in real-world multi-turn dialogues.

Method: Employed survival modeling framework with Cox proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest approaches to analyze conversation failure as time-to-event process across 9 state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: Abrupt prompt-to-prompt semantic drift dramatically increases conversational failure hazard, while gradual cumulative drift significantly reduces failure risk and enables longer dialogues. AFT models with interactions showed superior performance with excellent discrimination and calibration.

Conclusion: Survival analysis is established as a powerful paradigm for evaluating LLM robustness, offering insights for designing resilient conversational agents and challenging assumptions about semantic consistency necessity in conversational AI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their
robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing
evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments,
failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that
characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive survival analysis of conversational AI robustness, analyzing
36,951 conversation turns across 9 state-of-the-art LLMs to model failure as a
time-to-event process. Our survival modeling framework-employing Cox
proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest
approaches-reveals extraordinary temporal dynamics. We find that abrupt,
prompt-to-prompt(P2P) semantic drift is catastrophic, dramatically increasing
the hazard of conversational failure. In stark contrast, gradual, cumulative
drift is highly protective, vastly reducing the failure hazard and enabling
significantly longer dialogues. AFT models with interactions demonstrate
superior performance, achieving excellent discrimination and exceptional
calibration. These findings establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm
for evaluating LLM robustness, offer concrete insights for designing resilient
conversational agents, and challenge prevailing assumptions about the necessity
of semantic consistency in conversational AI Systems.

*Srinivas Billa,Xiaonan Jing*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Existing LLM benchmarks fail to assess performance in low-resource tasks. The authors created 14 travel-domain datasets from real-world data and found that general benchmarks don't reflect model capabilities in domain-specific scenarios, with reasoning being particularly beneficial for smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks provide limited insight into model performance for low-resource tasks, making it difficult to develop effective solutions in specialized domains like travel.

Method: Curated 14 travel-domain datasets spanning 7 common NLP tasks using anonymized real-world data, then analyzed LLM performance across accuracy, scaling behavior, and reasoning capabilities.

Result: General benchmarking results are insufficient for understanding model performance in low-resource tasks. LLMs hit performance bottlenecks in complex domain-specific scenarios regardless of training FLOPs. Reasoning provides significant performance boost for smaller LLMs.

Conclusion: Domain-specific evaluation is crucial for understanding LLM capabilities in low-resource scenarios, and reasoning capabilities are particularly important for smaller models in specialized domains.

Abstract: Results on existing LLM benchmarks capture little information over the model
capabilities in low-resource tasks, making it difficult to develop effective
solutions in these domains. To address these challenges, we curated 14
travel-domain datasets spanning 7 common NLP tasks using anonymised data from
real-world scenarios, and analysed the performance across LLMs. We report on
the accuracy, scaling behaviour, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a
variety of tasks. Our results confirm that general benchmarking results are
insufficient for understanding model performance in low-resource tasks. Despite
the amount of training FLOPs, out-of-the-box LLMs hit performance bottlenecks
in complex, domain-specific scenarios. Furthermore, reasoning provides a more
significant boost for smaller LLMs by making the model a better judge on
certain tasks.

*KM Pooja,Cheng Long,Aixin Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes PGMEL, a generative adversarial network using policy gradient for multimodal entity linking that generates high-quality negative samples to improve representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal entity linking methods don't explore the potential of high-quality negative sample selection, which is crucial for metric learning.

Method: Uses generative adversarial setting with generator creating negative samples and discriminator handling metric learning, optimized via policy gradient for discrete sample generation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets by learning meaningful representations through challenging negative samples.

Conclusion: PGMEL effectively addresses the gap in negative sample selection for multimodal entity linking and demonstrates superior performance through adversarial learning with policy gradient optimization.

Abstract: The task of entity linking, which involves associating mentions with their
respective entities in a knowledge graph, has received significant attention
due to its numerous potential applications. Recently, various multimodal entity
linking (MEL) techniques have been proposed, targeted to learn comprehensive
embeddings by leveraging both text and vision modalities. The selection of
high-quality negative samples can potentially play a crucial role in
metric/representation learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, this
possibility remains unexplored in existing literature within the framework of
MEL. To fill this gap, we address the multimodal entity linking problem in a
generative adversarial setting where the generator is responsible for
generating high-quality negative samples, and the discriminator is assigned the
responsibility for the metric learning tasks. Since the generator is involved
in generating samples, which is a discrete process, we optimize it using policy
gradient techniques and propose a policy gradient-based generative adversarial
network for multimodal entity linking (PGMEL). Experimental results based on
Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets demonstrate that PGMEL learns
meaningful representation by selecting challenging negative samples and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An evaluation framework using contrastive learning-based encoder to assess nuanced stereotypical biases in LLMs for Indian cultural contexts, revealing persistent biases across demographic axes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias assessment methods fall short in capturing nuanced stereotypes in culturally diverse contexts like India, necessitating rigorous evaluation of LLMs deployed in high-stakes applications.

Method: Proposed an evaluation framework with encoder trained using contrastive learning to capture fine-grained bias through embedding similarity, and introduced IndiCASA dataset with 2,575 human-validated sentences across five demographic axes.

Result: All evaluated open-weight LLMs exhibited stereotypical bias, with disability-related biases being notably persistent and religion bias generally lower due to global debiasing efforts.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the need for fairer model development as current LLMs show embedded biases across multiple demographic dimensions in Indian context.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across critical
domains owing to their impressive contextual understanding and generative
capabilities. However, their increasing deployment in high stakes applications
necessitates rigorous evaluation of embedded biases, particularly in culturally
diverse contexts like India where existing embedding-based bias assessment
methods often fall short in capturing nuanced stereotypes. We propose an
evaluation framework based on a encoder trained using contrastive learning that
captures fine-grained bias through embedding similarity. We also introduce a
novel dataset - IndiCASA (IndiBias-based Contextually Aligned Stereotypes and
Anti-stereotypes) comprising 2,575 human-validated sentences spanning five
demographic axes: caste, gender, religion, disability, and socioeconomic
status. Our evaluation of multiple open-weight LLMs reveals that all models
exhibit some degree of stereotypical bias, with disability related biases being
notably persistent, and religion bias generally lower likely due to global
debiasing efforts demonstrating the need for fairer model development.

TL;DR: Self-aware reinforcement learning enables LLMs to improve reasoning with minimal data by predicting task difficulty and recognizing capability limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL training for LLMs requires substantial data annotation efforts, which is resource-intensive. This work aims to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities through RL while minimizing data dependency.

Method: Alternates between LLM proposing tasks and solving them. Uses self-aware difficulty prediction to prioritize challenging but solvable tasks, and self-aware limit breaking to recognize when tasks exceed capabilities and request external data.

Result: Achieved 53.8% relative improvement on nine benchmarks with less than 1.2% extra data, demonstrating significant performance gains with minimal additional data requirements.

Conclusion: Self-aware RL is effective for improving LLMs with minimal data, showing promise for self-evolving agent training approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but such training
typically demands substantial efforts in creating and annotating data. In this
work, we explore improving LLMs through RL with minimal data. Our approach
alternates between the LLM proposing a task and then attempting to solve it. To
minimize data dependency, we introduce two novel mechanisms grounded in
self-awareness: (1) self-aware difficulty prediction, where the model learns to
assess task difficulty relative to its own abilities and prioritize challenging
yet solvable tasks, and (2) self-aware limit breaking, where the model
recognizes when a task is beyond its capability boundary and proactively
requests external data to break through that limit. Extensive experiments on
nine benchmarks showing a 53.8% relative improvement with less than 1.2% extra
data demonstrate the efficacy of self-aware RL and underscore the promise of
self-evolving agent training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XTRA is a cross-lingual topic modeling framework that combines Bag-of-Words modeling with multilingual embeddings through representation and topic alignments to achieve better topic coherence, diversity, and cross-lingual consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-lingual topic modeling methods struggle with ensuring high topic coherence and consistent alignment across languages, despite achieving some improvements in topic diversity.

Method: XTRA unifies Bag-of-Words modeling with multilingual embeddings using two core components: (1) representation alignment via contrastive learning to align document-topic distributions in a shared semantic space, and (2) topic alignment to project topic-word distributions into the same space for cross-lingual consistency.

Result: Experiments on multilingual corpora show that XTRA significantly outperforms strong baselines in topic coherence, diversity, and alignment quality.

Conclusion: XTRA effectively learns interpretable topics that are both coherent and diverse while maintaining strong cross-lingual alignment through its dual alignment mechanism.

Abstract: Cross-lingual topic modeling aims to uncover shared semantic themes across
languages. Several methods have been proposed to address this problem,
leveraging both traditional and neural approaches. While previous methods have
achieved some improvements in topic diversity, they often struggle to ensure
high topic coherence and consistent alignment across languages. We propose XTRA
(Cross-Lingual Topic Modeling with Topic and Representation Alignments), a
novel framework that unifies Bag-of-Words modeling with multilingual
embeddings. XTRA introduces two core components: (1) representation alignment,
aligning document-topic distributions via contrastive learning in a shared
semantic space; and (2) topic alignment, projecting topic-word distributions
into the same space to enforce crosslingual consistency. This dual mechanism
enables XTRA to learn topics that are interpretable (coherent and diverse) and
well-aligned across languages. Experiments on multilingual corpora confirm that
XTRA significantly outperforms strong baselines in topic coherence, diversity,
and alignment quality. Code and reproducible scripts are available at https:

TL;DR: This thesis addresses challenges in automated personality assessment from social media text by creating large datasets (MBTI9k and PANDORA) and developing the SIMPA framework for interpretable personality assessment using semantic similarity matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the scarcity of personality-labeled datasets and bridge the gap between personality psychology and NLP, enabling more valid and interpretable automated personality assessment from digital footprints.

Method: Created two Reddit-based datasets (MBTI9k and PANDORA) with personality labels and demographic information, then developed the SIMPA framework that uses machine learning and semantic similarity to match user statements with validated questionnaire items.

Result: Experiments showed demographic variables influence model validity. SIMPA achieved personality assessments comparable to human evaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency.

Conclusion: SIMPA provides an effective framework for interpretable personality assessment that extends beyond personality to various applications with complex label taxonomies, offering model-agnostic design and scalability.

Abstract: Personality refers to individual differences in behavior, thinking, and
feeling. With the growing availability of digital footprints, especially from
social media, automated methods for personality assessment have become
increasingly important. Natural language processing (NLP) enables the analysis
of unstructured text data to identify personality indicators. However, two main
challenges remain central to this thesis: the scarcity of large,
personality-labeled datasets and the disconnect between personality psychology
and NLP, which restricts model validity and interpretability. To address these
challenges, this thesis presents two datasets -- MBTI9k and PANDORA --
collected from Reddit, a platform known for user anonymity and diverse
discussions. The PANDORA dataset contains 17 million comments from over 10,000
users and integrates the MBTI and Big Five personality models with demographic
information, overcoming limitations in data size, quality, and label coverage.
Experiments on these datasets show that demographic variables influence model
validity. In response, the SIMPA (Statement-to-Item Matching Personality
Assessment) framework was developed - a computational framework for
interpretable personality assessment that matches user-generated statements
with validated questionnaire items. By using machine learning and semantic
similarity, SIMPA delivers personality assessments comparable to human
evaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency. Although
focused on personality assessment, SIMPA's versatility extends beyond this
domain. Its model-agnostic design, layered cue detection, and scalability make
it suitable for various research and practical applications involving complex
label taxonomies and variable cue associations with target concepts.

*Tengjun Ni,Xin Yuan,Shenghong Li,Kai Wu,Ren Ping Liu,Wei Ni,Wenjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StepChain GraphRAG improves multi-hop QA by combining question decomposition with BFS reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results while enhancing explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in integrating iterative reasoning with external knowledge retrieval for more accurate and interpretable multi-hop question answering.

Method: Builds global corpus index, parses retrieved passages into knowledge graphs, splits queries into sub-questions, and uses BFS-based traversal to assemble explicit evidence chains without overwhelming the language model.

Result: Achieves SOTA on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA with average EM improvement of 2.57% and F1 improvement of 2.13%, largest gains on HotpotQA (+4.70% EM, +3.44% F1).

Conclusion: Framework enhances explainability through chain-of-thought preservation; future work should address computational overhead and potential LLM hallucinations for improved efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: Recent progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has led to more
accurate and interpretable multi-hop question answering (QA). Yet, challenges
persist in integrating iterative reasoning steps with external knowledge
retrieval. To address this, we introduce StepChain GraphRAG, a framework that
unites question decomposition with a Breadth-First Search (BFS) Reasoning Flow
for enhanced multi-hop QA. Our approach first builds a global index over the
corpus; at inference time, only retrieved passages are parsed on-the-fly into a
knowledge graph, and the complex query is split into sub-questions. For each
sub-question, a BFS-based traversal dynamically expands along relevant edges,
assembling explicit evidence chains without overwhelming the language model
with superfluous context. Experiments on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA
show that StepChain GraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art Exact Match and F1
scores. StepChain GraphRAG lifts average EM by 2.57% and F1 by 2.13% over the
SOTA method, achieving the largest gain on HotpotQA (+4.70% EM, +3.44% F1).
StepChain GraphRAG also fosters enhanced explainability by preserving the
chain-of-thought across intermediate retrieval steps. We conclude by discussing
how future work can mitigate the computational overhead and address potential
hallucinations from large language models to refine efficiency and reliability
in multi-hop QA.

### [116] [Evaluating Large Language Models for IUCN Red List Species Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02830)
*Shinya Uryu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show high accuracy for taxonomic classification (94.9%) but poor performance for conservation reasoning (27.2%), revealing a knowledge-reasoning gap and systematic biases favoring charismatic vertebrates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically validate the reliability of LLMs for species evaluation in conservation, given their rapid adoption to address the biodiversity crisis.

Method: Systematic validation of five leading LLM models on 21,955 species across four core IUCN Red List assessment components: taxonomy, conservation status, distribution, and threats.

Result: Models excelled at taxonomic classification but consistently failed at conservation reasoning, showing a knowledge-reasoning gap across all models. Models also exhibited systematic biases favoring charismatic vertebrates.

Conclusion: LLMs are powerful for information retrieval but require human oversight for judgment-based decisions. A hybrid approach is recommended where LLMs augment expert capacity while human experts retain authority over risk assessment and policy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted in conservation to
address the biodiversity crisis, yet their reliability for species evaluation
is uncertain. This study systematically validates five leading models on 21,955
species across four core IUCN Red List assessment components: taxonomy,
conservation status, distribution, and threats. A critical paradox was
revealed: models excelled at taxonomic classification (94.9%) but consistently
failed at conservation reasoning (27.2% for status assessment). This
knowledge-reasoning gap, evident across all models, suggests inherent
architectural constraints, not just data limitations. Furthermore, models
exhibited systematic biases favoring charismatic vertebrates, potentially
amplifying existing conservation inequities. These findings delineate clear
boundaries for responsible LLM deployment: they are powerful tools for
information retrieval but require human oversight for judgment-based decisions.
A hybrid approach is recommended, where LLMs augment expert capacity while
human experts retain sole authority over risk assessment and policy.

### [117] [Constraint Satisfaction Approaches to Wordle: Novel Heuristics and Cross-Lexicon Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02855)
*Jahidul Arafat,Fariha Tasmin,Sanjaya Poudel,Kamrujjaman,Eftakhar Ahmed Arnob,Ahsan Habib Tareq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with novel constraint-aware solving strategies, achieving significant performance improvements over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Wordle solvers rely on information-theoretic entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint treatment, creating a need for principled CSP approaches.

Method: Introduces CSP-Aware Entropy (computing information gain after constraint propagation) and Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian word-frequency priors with logical constraints.

Result: CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9% success rate, 1.7% improvement over Forward Checking with 46% faster runtime. Maintains 5.3 percentage point advantage under 10% noise, and Probabilistic CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels.

Conclusion: Principled constraint satisfaction techniques outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for structured puzzle-solving domains, with core CSP principles transferring across languages.

Abstract: Wordle presents an algorithmically rich testbed for constraint satisfaction
problem (CSP) solving. While existing solvers rely on information-theoretic
entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint
treatment, we present the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with
novel constraint-aware solving strategies. We introduce CSP-Aware Entropy,
computing information gain after constraint propagation rather than on raw
candidate sets, and a Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian
word-frequency priors with logical constraints. Through evaluation on 2,315
English words, CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9%
success rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward
Checking (t=-4.82, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms
versus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3
percentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic
CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint
recovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates
88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP
principles transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from
linguistic differences (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source
implementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides
reproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP
treatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration,
robustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance
benchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques
outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for
structured puzzle-solving domains.

### [118] [Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02919)
*Jian Mu,Qixin Zhang,Zhiyong Wang,Menglin Yang,Shuang Qiu,Chengwei Qin,Zhongxiang Dai,Yao Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SRGen is a test-time framework that enables LLMs to self-reflect before generating uncertain tokens, using dynamic entropy thresholding to identify high-uncertainty points and applying corrective vectors to improve reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM self-reflection methods are reactive (revising full drafts) or require expensive training, making them inefficient for addressing error cascades in chain-of-thought reasoning.

Method: Uses dynamic entropy thresholding to detect uncertain tokens during generation, then applies specific corrective vectors that exploit generated context to self-reflect and correct token probability distributions.

Result: Significantly improves reasoning performance: +12.0% Pass@1 and +13.3% Cons@5 on AIME2024 with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, with consistent gains across mathematical reasoning benchmarks and various LLMs.

Conclusion: SRGen provides a plug-and-play method for integrating reflection into generation, achieving reliable reasoning improvements with bounded overhead and broad compatibility with other techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve complex reasoning tasks via
long chain-of-thought, but their forward-only autoregressive generation process
is fragile; early token errors can cascade, which creates a clear need for
self-reflection mechanisms. However, existing self-reflection either performs
revisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training,
both fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose
Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time
framework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token
generation, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify
high-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific
corrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a
self-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By
retrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more
trustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors
at highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model
reasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger
self-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on
Pass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5. Moreover, our findings position SRGen as a
plug-and-play method that integrates reflection into the generation process for
reliable LLM reasoning, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and
broad composability with other training-time (e.g., RLHF) and test-time (e.g.,
SLOT) techniques.

TL;DR: The CDR benchmark is the first comprehensive test set for evaluating conversational data retrieval systems, revealing significant performance gaps in existing embedding models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized evaluation for conversational data retrieval systems and understand the unique challenges in retrieving product insights from conversation data.

Method: Created a benchmark with 1.6k queries across five analytical tasks and 9.1k conversations, then evaluated 16 popular embedding models on this benchmark.

Result: Even the best models achieved only around NDCG@10 of 0.51, showing substantial performance gap compared to document retrieval. Identified unique challenges including implicit state recognition, turn dynamics, and contextual references.

Conclusion: Conversational data retrieval presents distinct challenges that current models struggle with, highlighting the need for specialized approaches and providing a standardized benchmark for future research.

Abstract: We present the Conversational Data Retrieval (CDR) benchmark, the first
comprehensive test set for evaluating systems that retrieve conversation data
for product insights. With 1.6k queries across five analytical tasks and 9.1k
conversations, our benchmark provides a reliable standard for measuring
conversational data retrieval performance. Our evaluation of 16 popular
embedding models shows that even the best models reach only around NDCG@10 of
0.51, revealing a substantial gap between document and conversational data
retrieval capabilities. Our work identifies unique challenges in conversational
data retrieval (implicit state recognition, turn dynamics, contextual
references) while providing practical query templates and detailed error
analysis across different task categories. The benchmark dataset and code are

*Jingqi Zhang,Ruibo Chen,Yingqing Yang,Peihua Mai,Heng Huang,Yan Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRACE is a black-box framework for detecting copyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning using distortion-free watermarks and entropy-gated detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable safeguards against unauthorized use of proprietary/copyrighted material in LLM fine-tuning, as existing methods require internal model access or have practical limitations.

Method: Rewrites datasets with distortion-free watermarks using private key, then uses entropy-gated procedure to selectively score high-uncertainty tokens for detection.

Result: Achieves significant detections (p<0.05) across diverse datasets and model families, supports multi-dataset attribution, and remains robust after continued pretraining.

Conclusion: TRACE provides practical black-box verification of copyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning while maintaining text quality and utility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on smaller,
domain-specific datasets to improve downstream performance. These datasets
often contain proprietary or copyrighted material, raising the need for
reliable safeguards against unauthorized use. Existing membership inference
attacks (MIAs) and dataset-inference methods typically require access to
internal signals such as logits, while current black-box approaches often rely
on handcrafted prompts or a clean reference dataset for calibration, both of
which limit practical applicability. Watermarking is a promising alternative,
but prior techniques can degrade text quality or reduce task performance. We
propose TRACE, a practical framework for fully black-box detection of
copyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning. \texttt{TRACE} rewrites datasets
with distortion-free watermarks guided by a private key, ensuring both text
quality and downstream utility. At detection time, we exploit the radioactivity
effect of fine-tuning on watermarked data and introduce an entropy-gated
procedure that selectively scores high-uncertainty tokens, substantially
amplifying detection power. Across diverse datasets and model families, TRACE
consistently achieves significant detections (p<0.05), often with extremely
strong statistical evidence. Furthermore, it supports multi-dataset attribution
and remains robust even after continued pretraining on large non-watermarked
corpora. These results establish TRACE as a practical route to reliable
black-box verification of copyrighted dataset usage. We will make our code
available at: https://github.com/NusIoraPrivacy/TRACE.

*Matthew Lewis,Samuel Thio,Richard JB Dobson,Spiros Denaxas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A RAG system was developed to query UK NICE clinical guidelines using LLMs, achieving high retrieval performance (MRR 0.814, 99.1% recall in top 10) and significantly improving answer faithfulness by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The extensive length and volume of NICE clinical guidelines impede their utilization in time-constrained healthcare systems, requiring a system to provide precisely matched information through natural language queries.

Method: Developed a RAG system with hybrid embedding mechanism, evaluated on 10,195 text chunks from 300 guidelines using 7,901 queries, and tested generation performance on 70 manually curated question-answer pairs.

Result: High retrieval performance with MRR 0.814, 81% recall at first chunk, 99.1% recall in top 10 chunks. RAG-enhanced models showed 64.7 percentage point improvement in faithfulness to 99.5%, significantly outperforming medical-focused Meditron3-8B LLM (43%).

Conclusion: RAG is an effective, reliable, and scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling cost-effective access to medical guidelines by preventing information fabrication through grounding answers in relevant source material.

Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) system for querying the United Kingdom's National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines using Large Language
Models (LLMs). The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede
their utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this
project addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users
with precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The
system's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was
evaluated against a database of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred
guidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
of 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten
retrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries.
  The most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the
generation phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy
question-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in
performance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the
source text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the
RAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused
Meditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. This, combined with a perfect Context
Precision score of 1 for all RAG-enhanced models, confirms the system's ability
to prevent information fabrication by grounding its answers in relevant source
material. This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and
scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling
cost-effective access to medical guidelines.

*Rongchen Guo,Vincent Francoeur,Isar Nejadgholi,Sylvain Gagnon,Miodrag Bolic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper distinguishes between descriptive semantics (context content) and expressive semantics (emotional state) in speech emotion recognition, showing they align with intended vs evoked emotions respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech Emotion Recognition accuracy is constrained by emotional nuances in speech, and distinguishing between descriptive and expressive semantics could improve human-computer interaction.

Method: Recorded audio clips of participants describing experiences after watching emotional movie segments, collected intended emotion tags, self-rated emotional responses, and valence/arousal scores.

Result: Descriptive semantics align with intended emotions, while expressive semantics correlate with evoked emotions.

Conclusion: Findings inform SER applications in human-AI interaction and enable more context-aware AI systems.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is essential for improving human-computer
interaction, yet its accuracy remains constrained by the complexity of
emotional nuances in speech. In this study, we distinguish between descriptive
semantics, which represents the contextual content of speech, and expressive
semantics, which reflects the speaker's emotional state. After watching
emotionally charged movie segments, we recorded audio clips of participants
describing their experiences, along with the intended emotion tags for each
clip, participants' self-rated emotional responses, and their valence/arousal
scores. Through experiments, we show that descriptive semantics align with
intended emotions, while expressive semantics correlate with evoked emotions.
Our findings inform SER applications in human-AI interaction and pave the way
for more context-aware AI systems.

*Oriol Pareras,Gerard I. Gállego,Federico Costa,Cristina España-Bonet,Javier Hernando*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Direct prompting for Speech-to-Text Translation using LLM-based models, finding that Direct prompting improves more consistently with increasing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically compare CoT and Direct prompting strategies for Speech-to-Text Translation under different data scales, as previous work focused on LLM-based models with CoT prompting.

Method: Pseudo-labeled an ASR corpus by translating transcriptions into six European languages, then trained LLM-based S2TT systems with both CoT and Direct prompting at different data scales.

Result: Direct prompting improves more consistently as the amount of data increases compared to CoT prompting.

Conclusion: Direct prompting may become a more effective approach than CoT as larger S2TT resources are created.

Abstract: Recent work on Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) has focused on LLM-based
models, introducing the increasingly adopted Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
where the model is guided to first transcribe the speech and then translate it.
CoT typically outperforms direct prompting primarily because it can exploit
abundant Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT)
datasets to explicitly model its steps. In this paper, we systematically
compare CoT and Direct prompting under increasing amounts of S2TT data. To this
end, we pseudo-label an ASR corpus by translating its transcriptions into six
European languages, and train LLM-based S2TT systems with both prompting
strategies at different data scales. Our results show that Direct improves more
consistently as the amount of data increases, suggesting that it may become a
more effective approach as larger S2TT resources are created.

*Beth Pearson,Ahmed Adnan,Zahraa Abdallah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method combining Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to compare preliminary and final radiology reports, achieving 67% exact-match accuracy and 93% accuracy within +/-1 compared to radiologist scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology report evaluation is crucial for training junior radiologists and ensuring diagnostic accuracy. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and final reports helps uncover gaps in clinical knowledge, but applying LLMs in radiology is challenging due to specialized domain knowledge requirements.

Method: Combines Llama 3.1 with Named-Entity-Recognition (NER) using tunable weights to emphasize or de-emphasize specific types of differences. Generates quantitative similarity scores and interpretable feedback for report comparison.

Result: Achieves 67% exact-match accuracy and 93% accuracy within +/- 1 when compared to radiologist-provided ground truth scores, outperforming both LLMs and NER used independently.

Conclusion: Llama-EntScore provides an effective solution for explainable and accurate radiology report comparison, offering valuable guidance for junior radiologists to review and refine their reporting skills.

Abstract: Radiology report evaluation is a crucial part of radiologists' training and
plays a key role in ensuring diagnostic accuracy. As part of the standard
reporting workflow, a junior radiologist typically prepares a preliminary
report, which is then reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist to produce
the final report. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and
final reports is essential for junior doctors, both as a training tool and to
help uncover gaps in clinical knowledge. While AI in radiology is a rapidly
growing field, the application of large language models (LLMs) remains
challenging due to the need for specialised domain knowledge. In this paper, we
explore the ability of LLMs to provide explainable and accurate comparisons of
reports in the radiology domain. We begin by comparing the performance of
several LLMs in comparing radiology reports. We then assess a more traditional
approach based on Named-Entity-Recognition (NER). However, both approaches
exhibit limitations in delivering accurate feedback on semantic similarity. To
address this, we propose Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method
using a combination of Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to emphasise or
de-emphasise specific types of differences. Our approach generates a
quantitative similarity score for tracking progress and also gives an
interpretation of the score that aims to offer valuable guidance in reviewing
and refining their reporting. We find our method achieves 67% exact-match
accuracy and 93% accuracy within +/- 1 when compared to radiologist-provided
ground truth scores - outperforming both LLMs and NER used independently. Code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-Thought prompting for Speech-to-Text Translation largely behaves like cascaded systems, relying mainly on transcripts rather than leveraging speech information, despite expectations it would overcome limitations of traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of cascaded S2TT systems (error propagation and inability to use acoustic cues) and evaluate whether Chain-of-Thought prompting can effectively integrate speech and text information.

Method: Analyzed CoT through attribution methods, robustness evaluations with corrupted transcripts, and prosody-awareness tests. Also tested training interventions like adding Direct S2TT data and noisy transcript injection.

Result: CoT largely mirrors cascaded behavior, relying mainly on transcripts while barely leveraging speech. Training interventions enhanced robustness and increased speech attribution.

Conclusion: The assumed advantages of CoT are challenged, highlighting the need for architectures that explicitly integrate acoustic information into translation rather than relying on prompting approaches.

Abstract: Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) systems built from Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT) modules face two major
limitations: error propagation and the inability to exploit prosodic or other
acoustic cues. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently been introduced,
with the expectation that jointly accessing speech and transcription will
overcome these issues. Analyzing CoT through attribution methods, robustness
evaluations with corrupted transcripts, and prosody-awareness, we find that it
largely mirrors cascaded behavior, relying mainly on transcripts while barely
leveraging speech. Simple training interventions, such as adding Direct S2TT
data or noisy transcript injection, enhance robustness and increase speech
attribution. These findings challenge the assumed advantages of CoT and
highlight the need for architectures that explicitly integrate acoustic
information into translation.

TL;DR: SurveyBench is a quiz-driven evaluation framework that assesses automated survey generation methods, revealing they perform 21% worse than human-written surveys on content quality metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated survey generation methods (LLM4Survey) produce outputs that fall short of human standards, and there's a lack of rigorous benchmarks to systematically evaluate their deficiencies.

Method: Proposed SurveyBench framework with: (1) survey topics from 11,343 arXiv papers and 4,947 high-quality surveys, (2) multifaceted metric hierarchy assessing outline quality, content quality, and non-textual richness, (3) dual-mode evaluation protocol with content-based and quiz-based answerability tests.

Result: SurveyBench effectively challenges existing LLM4Survey approaches, showing they perform on average 21% lower than human-written surveys in content-based evaluation.

Conclusion: SurveyBench provides a comprehensive benchmark that reveals significant gaps between automated survey generation and human-written surveys, particularly in content quality aspects.

Abstract: Academic survey writing, which distills vast literature into a coherent and
insightful narrative, remains a labor-intensive and intellectually demanding
task. While recent approaches, such as general DeepResearch agents and
survey-specialized methods, can generate surveys automatically (a.k.a.
LLM4Survey), their outputs often fall short of human standards and there lacks
a rigorous, reader-aligned benchmark for thoroughly revealing their
deficiencies. To fill the gap, we propose a fine-grained, quiz-driven
evaluation framework SurveyBench, featuring (1) typical survey topics source
from recent 11,343 arXiv papers and corresponding 4,947 high-quality surveys;
(2) a multifaceted metric hierarchy that assesses the outline quality (e.g.,
coverage breadth, logical coherence), content quality (e.g., synthesis
granularity, clarity of insights), and non-textual richness; and (3) a
dual-mode evaluation protocol that includes content-based and quiz-based
answerability tests, explicitly aligned with readers' informational needs.
Results show SurveyBench effectively challenges existing LLM4Survey approaches
(e.g., on average 21% lower than human in content-based evaluation).

### [127] [Beyond the Final Layer: Intermediate Representations for Better Multilingual Calibration in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03136)
*Ej Zhou,Caiqi Zhang,Tiancheng Hu,Chengzu Li,Nigel Collier,Ivan Vulić,Anna Korhonen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reveals systematic calibration issues in multilingual LLMs, showing non-English languages have worse confidence calibration than English, and proposes training-free methods like LACE to improve multilingual calibration by using late-intermediate layers instead of the final layer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Confidence calibration is crucial for reliable LLM deployment but remains under-explored in multilingual contexts, with non-English languages suffering from systematically worse calibration due to English-centric training bias in final layers.

Method: Conducted large-scale multilingual calibration studies across 6 model families and 100+ languages, analyzed internal representations layer-wise, and introduced training-free methods including Language-Aware Confidence Ensemble (LACE) that adaptively selects optimal layer ensembles for each language.

Result: Found that final layers provide poor multilingual confidence signals due to English-centric bias, while late-intermediate layers consistently offer more reliable and better-calibrated signals across languages.

Conclusion: Highlights hidden costs of English-centric alignment and provides a path toward more globally equitable LLMs by using layer-wise analysis and adaptive ensemble methods beyond the final layer for better multilingual confidence calibration.

Abstract: Confidence calibration, the alignment of a model's predicted confidence with
its actual accuracy, is crucial for the reliable deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, this critical property remains largely under-explored
in multilingual contexts. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale,
systematic studies of multilingual calibration across six model families and
over 100 languages, revealing that non-English languages suffer from
systematically worse calibration. To diagnose this, we investigate the model's
internal representations and find that the final layer, biased by
English-centric training, provides a poor signal for multilingual confidence.
In contrast, our layer-wise analysis uncovers a key insight that
late-intermediate layers consistently offer a more reliable and
better-calibrated signal. Building on this, we introduce a suite of
training-free methods, including Language-Aware Confidence Ensemble (LACE),
which adaptively selects an optimal ensemble of layers for each specific
language. Our study highlights the hidden costs of English-centric alignment
and offer a new path toward building more globally equitable and trustworthy
LLMs by looking beyond the final layer.

### [128] [EditLens: Quantifying the Extent of AI Editing in Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03154)
*Katherine Thai,Bradley Emi,Elyas Masrour,Mohit Iyyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces EditLens, a model that detects AI-edited text and quantifies the degree of AI editing, achieving state-of-the-art performance in distinguishing human, AI, and mixed writing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While previous work focused on detecting fully AI-generated text, this research addresses the growing need to identify AI-edited text, as many queries to LLMs involve editing user-provided text rather than generating from scratch.

Method: Proposed lightweight similarity metrics to quantify AI editing magnitude, validated with human annotators, then trained EditLens regression model using these metrics as intermediate supervision to predict the amount of AI editing in text.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with F1=94.7% on binary classification and F1=90.4% on ternary classification tasks. Successfully analyzed AI-edits from Grammarly as a case study.

Conclusion: AI-edited text is distinguishable from human-written and AI-generated text, and the degree of AI editing can be detected, with implications for authorship attribution, education, and policy. Models and dataset will be publicly released.

Abstract: A significant proportion of queries to large language models ask them to edit
user-provided text, rather than generate new text from scratch. While previous
work focuses on detecting fully AI-generated text, we demonstrate that
AI-edited text is distinguishable from human-written and AI-generated text.
First, we propose using lightweight similarity metrics to quantify the
magnitude of AI editing present in a text given the original human-written text
and validate these metrics with human annotators. Using these similarity
metrics as intermediate supervision, we then train EditLens, a regression model
that predicts the amount of AI editing present within a text. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both binary (F1=94.7%) and ternary
(F1=90.4%) classification tasks in distinguishing human, AI, and mixed writing.
Not only do we show that AI-edited text can be detected, but also that the
degree of change made by AI to human writing can be detected, which has
implications for authorship attribution, education, and policy. Finally, as a
case study, we use our model to analyze the effects of AI-edits applied by
Grammarly, a popular writing assistance tool. To encourage further research, we
commit to publicly releasing our models and dataset.

### [129] [Neural Correlates of Language Models Are Specific to Human Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03156)
*Iñigo Parra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study validates previous findings about correlations between LLM hidden states and fMRI brain responses, showing robustness to dimensionality concerns, confirming with new similarity measures, and establishing specificity to language-trained models with positional encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether previous correlations between LLM hidden states and fMRI brain responses are robust to potential methodological concerns and to strengthen evidence for representational similarity between models and brain states.

Method: The study conducted multiple validation tests: (i) dimensionality reduction analysis, (ii) new similarity measures, (iii) comparison with non-language-trained models, and (iv) examination of positional encoding effects.

Result: Previous correlations remain after dimensionality reduction, are confirmed with new similarity measures, are specific to human language-trained models, and depend on positional encoding presence.

Conclusion: The results confirm and strengthen previous findings, supporting the biological plausibility and interpretability of large language models in relation to brain representations.

Abstract: Previous work has shown correlations between the hidden states of large
language models and fMRI brain responses, on language tasks. These correlations
have been taken as evidence of the representational similarity of these models
and brain states. This study tests whether these previous results are robust to
several possible concerns. Specifically this study shows: (i) that the previous
results are still found after dimensionality reduction, and thus are not
attributable to the curse of dimensionality; (ii) that previous results are
confirmed when using new measures of similarity; (iii) that correlations
between brain representations and those from models are specific to models
trained on human language; and (iv) that the results are dependent on the
presence of positional encoding in the models. These results confirm and
strengthen the results of previous research and contribute to the debate on the
biological plausibility and interpretability of state-of-the-art large language
models.

*Xuan Xu,Haolun Li,Zhongliang Yang,Beilin Chu,Jia Song,Moxuan Xu,Linna Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new paradigm for topic modeling using large language models (LLMs) as long-form generation tasks, challenging traditional neural topic models (NTMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs can outperform traditional neural topic models in topic quality and examine the claim that most NTMs are outdated.

Method: Proposes a simple LLM-based approach: sample data subset, generate topics and representative text using prompts, and assign text with keyword matching. Compares this zero-shot prompting method against NTMs.

Result: The paper systematically compares LLMs and NTMs in terms of topic quality through empirical examination.

Conclusion: The research investigates whether the long-form generation paradigm with LLMs can beat traditional neural topic models, potentially making many existing NTMs outdated.

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as neural topic models rely on inference and
generation networks to learn latent topic distributions. This paper explores a
new paradigm for topic modeling in the era of large language models, framing TM
as a long-form generation task whose definition is updated in this paradigm. We
propose a simple but practical approach to implement LLM-based topic model
tasks out of the box (sample a data subset, generate topics and representative
text with our prompt, text assignment with keyword match). We then investigate
whether the long-form generation paradigm can beat NTMs via zero-shot
prompting. We conduct a systematic comparison between NTMs and LLMs in terms of
topic quality and empirically examine the claim that "a majority of NTMs are
outdated."

### [131] [Model-Based Ranking of Source Languages for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03202)
*Abteen Ebrahimi,Adam Wiemerslage,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NN-Rank is a novel algorithm that ranks source languages for cross-lingual transfer using multilingual model representations and unlabeled target data, outperforming existing methods on POS and NER tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for cross-lingual transfer rely on lexical and linguistic features, which may not be optimal. There's a need for better methods that can leverage multilingual model representations to identify the most suitable source languages for transfer learning.

Method: NN-Rank uses hidden representations from multilingual models combined with unlabeled target-language data to rank source languages. It was tested on 51 source languages for POS tagging (56 target languages) and NER (72 target languages), using both in-domain data and the Bible as out-of-domain corpus.

Result: NN-Rank outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with average improvements of 35.56 NDCG for POS and 18.14 NDCG for NER. It remains competitive using only the Bible corpus and works well with as few as 25 unlabeled examples, achieving 92.8% of the NDCG obtained with full data.

Conclusion: NN-Rank provides an effective and data-efficient approach for source language ranking in cross-lingual transfer, demonstrating strong performance across different domains and with minimal target data requirements.

Abstract: We present NN-Rank, an algorithm for ranking source languages for
cross-lingual transfer, which leverages hidden representations from
multilingual models and unlabeled target-language data. We experiment with two
pretrained multilingual models and two tasks: part-of-speech tagging (POS) and
named entity recognition (NER). We consider 51 source languages and evaluate on
56 and 72 target languages for POS and NER, respectively. When using in-domain
data, NN-Rank beats state-of-the-art baselines that leverage lexical and
linguistic features, with average improvements of up to 35.56 NDCG for POS and
18.14 NDCG for NER. As prior approaches can fall back to language-level
features if target language data is not available, we show that NN-Rank remains
competitive using only the Bible, an out-of-domain corpus available for a large
number of languages. Ablations on the amount of unlabeled target data show
that, for subsets consisting of as few as 25 examples, NN-Rank produces
high-quality rankings which achieve 92.8% of the NDCG achieved using all
available target data for ranking.

*Imene Kerboua,Sahar Omidi Shayegan,Megh Thakkar,Xing Han Lù,Léo Boisvert,Massimo Caccia,Jérémy Espinas,Alexandre Aussem,Véronique Eglin,Alexandre Lacoste*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FocusAgent uses lightweight LLM retrieval to extract relevant lines from web page accessibility trees, reducing observation size by over 50% while maintaining performance and improving security against prompt injection attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agents process lengthy web pages that exceed context limits, increase computational costs, and expose agents to security risks like prompt injection. Existing pruning methods either discard relevant content or keep irrelevant context, leading to poor action prediction.

Method: Leverages a lightweight LLM retriever to extract the most relevant lines from accessibility tree (AxTree) observations, guided by task goals. This prunes noisy and irrelevant content while enabling efficient reasoning.

Result: On WorkArena and WebArena benchmarks, FocusAgent matches strong baseline performance while reducing observation size by over 50%. A variant significantly reduces success rate of prompt-injection attacks (including banner and pop-up attacks) while maintaining task success in attack-free settings.

Conclusion: Targeted LLM-based retrieval is a practical and robust strategy for building web agents that are efficient, effective, and secure against injection attacks.

Abstract: Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) must process lengthy web
page observations to complete user goals; these pages often exceed tens of
thousands of tokens. This saturates context limits and increases computational
cost processing; moreover, processing full pages exposes agents to security
risks such as prompt injection. Existing pruning strategies either discard
relevant content or retain irrelevant context, leading to suboptimal action
prediction. We introduce FocusAgent, a simple yet effective approach that
leverages a lightweight LLM retriever to extract the most relevant lines from
accessibility tree (AxTree) observations, guided by task goals. By pruning
noisy and irrelevant content, FocusAgent enables efficient reasoning while
reducing vulnerability to injection attacks. Experiments on WorkArena and
WebArena benchmarks show that FocusAgent matches the performance of strong
baselines, while reducing observation size by over 50%. Furthermore, a variant
of FocusAgent significantly reduces the success rate of prompt-injection
attacks, including banner and pop-up attacks, while maintaining task success
performance in attack-free settings. Our results highlight that targeted
LLM-based retrieval is a practical and robust strategy for building web agents
that are efficient, effective, and secure.

### [133] [Cache-to-Cache: Direct Semantic Communication Between Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03215)
*Tianyu Fu,Zihan Min,Hanling Zhang,Jichao Yan,Guohao Dai,Wanli Ouyang,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cache-to-Cache (C2C) enables direct semantic communication between LLMs using KV-cache projection and fusion, avoiding text generation bottlenecks and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based communication between LLMs loses semantic information and incurs token-by-token generation latency. The authors explore whether LLMs can communicate beyond text to preserve rich internal representations.

Method: C2C uses neural networks to project and fuse source model's KV-cache with target model's KV-cache. A learnable gating mechanism selects target layers that benefit from cache communication, enabling direct semantic transfer without intermediate text generation.

Result: C2C achieves 8.5-10.5% higher average accuracy than individual models and outperforms text communication by 3.0-5.0% with 2.0x speedup in latency.

Conclusion: KV-cache serves as an effective medium for inter-model communication, enabling direct semantic transfer that improves both performance and efficiency compared to text-based approaches.

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large
Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a
single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing
internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This
process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token
generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs
communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache
semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size,
supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus,
we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic
communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the
source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic
transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit
from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the
deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit
intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5%
higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text
communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average
2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at

*Hongxiang Zhang,Yuan Tian,Tianyi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-Anchor is a novel prompting method that structures reasoning trajectories to maintain LLM attention on critical steps, outperforming SOTA methods across six benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As reasoning chains extend in LLMs, critical intermediate steps and original prompts get buried in context, receiving insufficient attention and causing errors.

Method: Decomposes reasoning trajectories into structured plans and automatically aligns model attention to the most relevant inference steps throughout generation.

Result: Outperforms SOTA prompting methods across six benchmarks, significantly reduces performance gap between non-reasoning and specialized reasoning models.

Conclusion: Self-Anchor enables most LLMs to tackle complex reasoning tasks without retraining by maintaining focus on critical reasoning steps.

Abstract: To solve complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs),
prompting-based methods offer a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, as reasoning chains extend, critical
intermediate steps and the original prompt will be buried in the context,
receiving insufficient attention and leading to errors. In this paper, we
propose Self-Anchor, a novel pipeline that leverages the inherent structure of
reasoning to steer LLM attention. Self-Anchor decomposes reasoning trajectories
into structured plans and automatically aligns the model's attention to the
most relevant inference steps, allowing the model to maintain focus throughout
generation. Our experiment shows that Self-Anchor outperforms SOTA prompting
methods across six benchmarks. Notably, Self-Anchor significantly reduces the
performance gap between ``non-reasoning'' models and specialized reasoning
models, with the potential to enable most LLMs to tackle complex reasoning
tasks without retraining.

### [135] [Reward Models are Metrics in a Trench Coat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03231)
*Sebastian Gehrmann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reward models and evaluation metrics for LLMs face similar challenges but are studied separately, leading to redundancy. Closer collaboration between these fields could address common issues like spurious correlations and reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the separation between reward model research and evaluation metric research in LLM post-training, which leads to redundant terminology and repeated pitfalls despite dealing with similar challenges.

Method: Conducted an extensive survey comparing reward models and evaluation metrics, analyzed their performance on specific tasks, and identified common challenges across both fields.

Result: Found that evaluation metrics can outperform reward models on certain tasks, and identified multiple areas where closer alignment could benefit both fields, including preference elicitation methods and avoidance of spurious correlations.

Conclusion: Closer collaboration between reward model and evaluation metric research can help overcome shared challenges and improve both areas through better alignment in methods and meta-evaluation approaches.

Abstract: The emergence of reinforcement learning in post-training of large language
models has sparked significant interest in reward models. Reward models assess
the quality of sampled model outputs to generate training signals. This task is
also performed by evaluation metrics that monitor the performance of an AI
model. We find that the two research areas are mostly separate, leading to
redundant terminology and repeated pitfalls. Common challenges include
susceptibility to spurious correlations, impact on downstream reward hacking,
methods to improve data quality, and approaches to meta-evaluation. Our
position paper argues that a closer collaboration between the fields can help
overcome these issues. To that end, we show how metrics outperform reward
models on specific tasks and provide an extensive survey of the two areas.
Grounded in this survey, we point to multiple research topics in which closer
alignment can improve reward models and metrics in areas such as preference
elicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and
calibration-aware meta-evaluation.

*Sagnik Anupam,Davis Brown,Shuo Li,Eric Wong,Hamed Hassani,Osbert Bastani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BrowserArena is a live open-web evaluation platform that identifies key failure modes in LLM web agents through head-to-head comparisons and step-level human feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agent evaluations are limited to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks, lacking real-world testing on the open web.

Method: Collect user-submitted tasks, run Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, use step-level human feedback to analyze agent traces, and construct targeted datasets for identified failure modes.

Result: Identified three consistent failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct URL navigation. Found o4-mini uses diverse captcha strategies while DeepSeek-R1 misleads about captcha resolution.

Conclusion: Current web agents show both diversity and brittleness, and the benchmarking methodology provides scalable evaluation of web agent failure modes.

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies issues with ShotBench benchmark and ShotVL model for cinematography understanding, and introduces RefineShot as a refined benchmark with improved evaluation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ambiguous option design in ShotBench benchmark and ShotVL's reasoning consistency issues that undermine evaluation reliability in cinematography understanding.

Method: Systematically refine ShotBench through consistent option restructuring, conduct critical analysis of ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce extended evaluation protocol assessing both task accuracy and core model competencies.

Result: Developed RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable assessment of cinematography understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: RefineShot overcomes limitations of previous benchmarks and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding through more reliable evaluation.

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

*Andrea Wynn,Metod Jazbec,Charith Peris,Rinat Khaziev,Anqi Liu,Daniel Khashabi,Eric Nalisnick*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a safety mechanism using distribution-free risk control to limit performance degradation from harmful in-context demonstrations while maintaining computational efficiency gains from helpful demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious in-context examples, creating safety concerns when adversaries tamper with demonstrations without human supervision.

Method: Define baseline safe behavior (zero-shot performance), apply distribution-free risk control with dynamic early exit prediction to ignore attention heads that attend to unsafe inputs, and modify DFRC to handle both harmful and helpful inputs.

Result: The approach effectively controls risk for harmful in-context demonstrations while achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with helpful demonstrations.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides principled safety mechanisms that protect LLMs from adversarial demonstrations while maintaining performance benefits from legitimate in-context examples.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies specific attention heads in OpenFlamingo-4B that encode spatial relations, extracts 'function vectors' from them, and shows these vectors can be manipulated to improve relational reasoning performance and solve analogy problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms behind LMMs' in-context learning abilities for relational tasks and enable better control over spatial relational reasoning.

Method: Applied causal mediation analysis to identify key attention heads, extracted multimodal function vectors from these heads, fine-tuned vectors with minimal data while keeping LMM frozen, and linearly combined vectors for analogy solving.

Result: Function vectors improved zero-shot accuracy, outperformed in-context learning baselines after fine-tuning, and successfully solved novel spatial relation analogies through linear combination.

Conclusion: LMMs encode spatial relational knowledge in localized structures that can be systematically extracted and optimized, advancing understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational reasoning.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing complex multi-agent workflows remains challenging. There's a need for autonomous systems that can orchestrate collaboration in dynamic human-AI teams.

Method: Formalized workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game. Proposed Autonomous Manager Agent concept that decomposes goals, allocates tasks, monitors progress, and adapts to changes. Released MA-Gym, an open-source simulation framework for multi-agent workflow orchestration.

Result: Evaluated GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows and found they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint adherence, and workflow runtime, highlighting workflow management as a difficult open problem.

Conclusion: Workflow management remains a challenging open problem. The paper identifies organizational and ethical implications of autonomous management systems and provides a research agenda with four foundational challenges for future work.

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool
call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical
environments. This work aims to utilize LLM enabled agents to automate and
accelerate the task of alloy discovery within the field of additive
manufacturing and showcase the benefits of adopting this multi-agent system.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks five reinforcement learning algorithms (DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, TRPO) for container stowage planning with crane scheduling, using a newly developed Gym environment to address the lack of systematic comparisons in this domain.


<details>

Motivation: Container stowage planning is crucial for maritime transportation efficiency but traditionally relies on human expertise. While RL has been applied to CSPP, there's a lack of systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms.

Method: Developed a Gym environment capturing CSPP fundamentals and extended it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent and single-agent formulations. Evaluated five RL algorithms (DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, TRPO) under multiple scenarios of varying complexity.

Result: Results show distinct performance gaps with increasing complexity, highlighting the importance of algorithm choice and problem formulation for CSPP.

Conclusion: The paper provides a benchmark for multiple RL methods in CSPP and offers a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, establishing a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime logistics.

Abstract: Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

*Jean Douglas Carvalho,Hugo Kenji,Ahmad Mohammad Saber,Glaucia Melo,Max Mauro Dias Santos,Deepa Kundur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-modal LLM framework that processes vehicle sensor data to generate natural-language safety alerts for drivers, validated with real-world urban driving data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers, vehicles, and the environment in EV-integrated smart grids.

Method: Combines visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded positioning, and CAN bus telemetry through a multi-modal LLM framework to process sensor data and generate driver alerts.

Result: Validated with real-world urban driving data; demonstrated effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations involving pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential as assistive tools in e-mobility, enabling safer driving decisions and supporting smart grid applications like fleet coordination and energy planning.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

### [144] [Mitigating Modal Imbalance in Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02608)
*Chen Henry Wu,Neil Kale,Aditi Raghunathan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Foundation models struggle with cross-modal reasoning when conflicting evidence appears across different modalities, showing extreme attention imbalance that doesn't improve with dataset scaling alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how foundation models perform joint reasoning across multiple modalities, especially when modalities interact and present conflicting evidence, which is crucial for real-world applications like computer-use agents.

Method: Study FMs on cross-modal conflicts where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities, analyze attention imbalance, and test a simple method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each training instance.

Result: FMs recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts 90% of the time but only 3% when evidence is split across modalities. Cross-modal attention imbalance is extreme, but explicit multimodal combination in training significantly reduces imbalance and improves downstream performance.

Conclusion: Systematically addressing cross-modal contexts is essential for building reliable foundation models, as current models show severe limitations in joint reasoning across modalities despite scaling efforts.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

### [145] [On the Role of Temperature Sampling in Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02611)
*Yuheng Wu,Azalia Mirhoseini,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Test-time scaling with multiple reasoning traces has diminishing returns at large sample sizes, but scaling along temperature dimension instead of just sample size significantly improves reasoning performance by exploring different subsets of problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work shows that increasing the number of reasoning samples (K) steadily improves accuracy, but this trend doesn't hold indefinitely - at large K, further scaling yields no gains and certain hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.

Method: Propose temperature scaling instead of single-temperature scaling, which explores different subsets of problems. Also design a multi-temperature voting method to reduce overhead.

Result: Temperature scaling yields an additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS across multiple models and benchmarks. Enables base models to reach performance comparable to RL-trained counterparts without additional post-training.

Conclusion: TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent potential of base models by exploring different reasoning boundaries.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

### [147] [A Concept of Possibility for Real-World Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02655)
*Daniel G. Schwartz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new concept of possibility as an alternative to Zadeh's standard possibility theory, focusing specifically on real-world events by considering prerequisites and constraints, with applications in planning problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an alternative to Zadeh's standard possibility theory that specifically addresses the possibility of real-world events, inspired by but formally different from the original concept.

Method: Events are viewed as having prerequisites (enabling occurrence) and constraints (impeding occurrence). Possibility is computed as a function of probabilities that prerequisites hold and constraints do not hold, using Łukasiewicz multivalent interpretation of logical connectives.

Result: Developed a new possibility theory that can be applied to planning problems to determine which plan is most possible (easiest or most feasible to complete), with an illustrative example for vehicle route planning.

Conclusion: This new version of possibility theory may correctly capture normal human reasoning about plans and has potential for future applications in planning domains.

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoMaAS is a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that automatically discovers optimal agent configurations using neural architecture search principles, achieving better performance with lower inference costs than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated design approaches for multi-agent systems fail to adapt resource allocation based on query complexity and domain requirements, seeking monolithic solutions instead of dynamic configurations.

Method: Leverages neural architecture search principles with four key innovations: automatic operator generation/fusion/elimination, dynamic cost-aware optimization, online feedback integration, and enhanced interpretability through decision tracing.

Result: Achieves 1.0-7.1% performance improvement while reducing inference costs by 3-5% across six benchmarks, with superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large language models through self-evolving architecture search.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design
approaches seek monolithic solutions that fail to adapt resource allocation
based on query complexity and domain requirements. This paper introduces
AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover
optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and
automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key
innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based
on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing
a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large
language models.

### [149] [ARMs: Adaptive Red-Teaming Agent against Multimodal Models with Plug-and-Play Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02677)
*Zhaorun Chen,Xun Liu,Mintong Kang,Jiawei Zhang,Minzhou Pan,Shuang Yang,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARMs is an adaptive red-teaming agent that systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for vision-language models (VLMs) by automatically optimizing diverse red-teaming strategies to effectively elicit harmful outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing red-teaming efforts for VLMs are either restricted to narrow adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering, lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world vulnerabilities in multimodal interfaces.

Method: ARMs uses reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration to optimize red-teaming strategies, integrates 17 red-teaming algorithms via model context protocol (MCP), employs 11 novel multimodal attack strategies, and uses layered memory with epsilon-greedy attack exploration to balance diversity and effectiveness.

Result: ARMs achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates, exceeding baselines by 52.1% on average and surpassing 90% on Claude-4-Sonnet. It generates significantly more diverse red-teaming instances and reveals emerging VLM vulnerabilities. The method also produces ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety dataset with 30K+ instances across 51 risk categories.

Conclusion: Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves VLM robustness while preserving general utility, providing actionable guidance for multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

*Yu-Zhe Shi,Qiao Xu,Yanjia Li,Mingchen Liu,Huamin Qu,Lecheng Ruan,Qining Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A constraint-centric architecture that regulates LLMs for automated constraint specification in production scheduling, addressing natural language ambiguity and reliability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual constraint specification for APS systems is labor-intensive, and direct LLM application faces challenges with ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited domain knowledge.

Method: Hierarchical structural space across three levels with domain-specific representation, plus automated production scenario adaptation algorithm for manufacturing customization.

Result: Significantly outperforms pure LLM-based approaches in constraint specification tasks, balancing LLM generative capabilities with manufacturing reliability requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture successfully enables reliable automated constraint specification for production scheduling by regulating LLMs through structured domain-specific frameworks.

Abstract: Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NCV is a training-free framework that improves LLM reasoning verification by using node-wise consistency checks instead of evaluating entire reasoning chains, achieving better accuracy with significantly fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for verifying multi-step reasoning in LLMs have issues with imprecise error localization, high token costs, attention dilution, and expensive multi-sampling requirements.

Method: Node-wise Consistency Verification (NCV) decomposes chain of thought into interconnected verification nodes and performs lightweight binary consistency checks at the node level, avoiding long-form generation.

Result: NCV achieves 10% to 25% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while using 6× to 58× fewer tokens than traditional CoT-based verifiers on public datasets.

Conclusion: NCV provides a scalable solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification that enhances both interpretability and efficiency through precise error localization.

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

*Wonjoong Kim,Sangwu Park,Yeonjun In,Sein Kim,Dongha Lee,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACE is a framework for multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agents that assesses reasoning trajectories beyond just final answers, addressing limitations of traditional answer-matching evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tool-augmented benchmarks evaluate only final answers, ignoring important aspects like efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity in problem-solving trajectories. Ground-truth trajectory annotation is expensive, and simple LLM evaluators struggle without ground truth.

Method: TRACE incorporates an evidence bank that accumulates knowledge from preceding reasoning steps, enabling multi-faceted analysis of agent trajectories. A meta-evaluation dataset was created by augmenting existing benchmarks with diverse flawed trajectories labeled with multi-faceted performance scores.

Result: TRACE accurately evaluates complex agent behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even with small open-source LLMs. The framework reveals previously unreported observations about agent trajectories in tool-augmented tasks.

Conclusion: TRACE provides an effective solution for comprehensive evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agents, enabling detailed assessment of reasoning trajectories and revealing important insights about agent performance that traditional methods miss.

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

*Antoine Maier,Aude Maier,Tom David*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper challenges the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA) in machine learning, arguing that training never perfectly satisfies objectives due to approximation, estimation, and optimization errors, leading to inevitable misspecification and potential Goodhart's law failures under strong optimization pressure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the rarely questioned assumption that training yields models satisfying their specified objectives, and to highlight the implications of systematic deviations from intended objectives in realistic conditions.

Method: The authors use a learning-paradigm-agnostic framework to analyze how approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic deviations from intended objectives, and build on recent mathematical results to show these gaps are indistinguishable from Goodhart's law failure modes.

Result: The analysis shows that OSA fails in realistic conditions, perfect objective specification is practically impossible, and without mathematical characterization of gaps, continued optimization risks pushing systems into predictable and irreversible loss of control.

Conclusion: A principled limit on optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary to prevent Goodhart's law failures and loss of control, as the breaking point cannot be located beforehand.

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

TL;DR: BayesianRouter is a hybrid framework for reward model routing that combines offline learning of RM strengths with online Bayesian selection, addressing cold-start and exploration issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLHF/RLAIF pipelines rely on single reward models, limiting alignment quality and risking overfitting. Existing RM routing methods suffer from cold-start problems and insufficient exploration.

Method: Hybrid framework with offline multi-task router training on preference data to estimate per-RM reliability, and online Bayesian Thompson sampling router for per-query RM selection using Gaussian priors from offline embeddings and adaptive posterior updates.

Result: Extensive experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show BayesianRouter consistently outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

Conclusion: BayesianRouter effectively addresses limitations of single RM approaches and existing routing methods by combining offline strength learning with online Bayesian adaptation, achieving superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing discrete diffusion models with rewards is challenging due to non-autoregressive paradigm making importance sampling intractable and rollout complex, which puzzles reinforcement learning methods like GRPO.

Method: Developed theoretical foundation for DDMs to build importance estimator capturing token fluctuation for gradient updates, and tailored rollout method for visual sequences to yield diverse completions and reliable optimization gradients.

Result: MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates across math reasoning, coding, and visual generation benchmarks, leading to stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality.

Conclusion: MaskGRPO establishes as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

*Martina Mattioli,Eike Petersen,Aasa Feragen,Marcello Pelillo,Siavash A. Bigdeli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how different explainable AI (XAI) methods incorporate specific ontological and epistemological assumptions about explanations, and how these assumptions affect the validity and interpretation of AI explanations across different domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods are black-box systems that lack explanations, limiting their trustworthiness. XAI methods aim to provide explanations but are often developed with technical assumptions that may not align with philosophical understandings of what constitutes an explanation.

Method: The authors investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in XAI methods applied to AI systems, analyzing how technical changes in XAI methods correspond to different underlying assumptions about explanations.

Result: The analysis reveals that seemingly minor technical modifications in XAI methods can represent significant differences in fundamental assumptions about the nature and knowability of explanations.

Conclusion: Ignoring the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when selecting XAI methods poses risks, and researchers should carefully choose and adapt XAI methods based on the specific application domain to ensure appropriate explanatory validity.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

*Anna Trapp,Mersedeh Sadeghi,Andreas Vogelsang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First formalization and implementation of counterfactual explanations for rule-based smart environments, showing user preference depends on context: causal explanations for simplicity/time pressure, counterfactuals for actionable problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual explanations are powerful in XAI but no established methods exist for generating them in rule-based smart environments, creating a gap in explainability for these domains.

Method: Developed a formalization and implementation of counterfactual explanations as a plugin extending an existing explanation engine for smart environments, then conducted user study (N=17) comparing counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations.

Result: User preference is highly contextual: causal explanations preferred for linguistic simplicity and time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals preferred for actionable content when users want to resolve problems.

Conclusion: Provides a practical framework for counterfactual explanations in smart environments and empirical evidence guiding when each explanation type is most effective based on user context and needs.

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study evaluates AI models' abstract reasoning capabilities on Raven's Progressive Matrices by deliberately omitting structural rules during training, revealing limitations in generalization to novel rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether AI models' success on RPM tasks reflects genuine reasoning ability or reliance on statistical shortcuts, and to investigate generalization capacity under incomplete training conditions.

Method: Evaluated sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures (CoPINet, Dual-Contrast Network) on the I-RAVEN dataset with deliberately omitted structural rules during training.

Result: Transformers showed strong performance on familiar rules but sharp accuracy decline on novel/omitted rules. Token-level vs complete answer accuracy gap revealed fundamental limitations in current approaches.

Conclusion: Current deep learning models have limitations in robust abstract reasoning, highlighting the need for architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward genuine reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance collaborative reasoning and cooperation in multiagent systems by exploring effective LLM prompting methods and integrating speech capabilities for better user interaction.

Method: Enhanced the CoELA framework by systematically experimenting with different LLMs and prompt engineering strategies, and integrated speech capabilities for voice-based interactions.

Result: The best prompt combination improved system efficiency by 22% compared to the original CoELA system when running with Gemma3, and speech integration provided a more engaging user interface.

Conclusion: Prompt optimization significantly enhances collaborative agent performance, and speech integration offers improved user experience for system development and demonstrations.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into multiagent systems has
opened new possibilities for collaborative reasoning and cooperation with AI
agents. This paper explores different prompting methods and evaluates their
effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making.
We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied
Agents that leverage LLMs for multi-agent communication, reasoning, and task
coordination in shared virtual spaces. Through systematic experimentation, we
examine different LLMs and prompt engineering strategies to identify optimised
combinations that maximise collaboration performance. Furthermore, we extend
our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless
collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent
performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the
system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system. In
addition, the speech integration provides a more engaging user interface for
iterative system development and demonstrations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoDA is a multi-agent system that automates data visualization from natural language queries using specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation, and self-reflection, achieving 41.5% improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems struggle with complex datasets and iterative refinement, failing to manage data complexity, code errors, or visualization quality effectively, highlighting the need for robust automation.

Method: Introduces CoDA, a collaborative multi-agent system with specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation, and self-reflection, using metadata-focused analysis to bypass token limits and quality-driven refinement for robustness.

Result: Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains in overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%.

Conclusion: The future of visualization automation lies in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows rather than isolated code generation.

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

### [161] [Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion: Make Your Diffusion Language Model a Latent Reasoner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03206)
*Cai Zhou,Chenxiao Yang,Yi Hu,Chenyu Wang,Chubin Zhang,Muhan Zhang,Lester Mackey,Tommi Jaakkola,Stephen Bates,Dinghuai Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Continuous diffusion models have stronger theoretical expressivity than discrete diffusions but underperform in practice due to trainability issues. The paper proposes CCDD - a joint multimodal diffusion process that combines continuous representation space with discrete token space to achieve both expressiveness and good trainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the contradiction between theoretical expressiveness of continuous diffusion models and their empirical underperformance compared to discrete counterparts, aiming to leverage the advantages of both continuous and discrete approaches.

Method: Propose Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion (CCDD) - a joint multimodal diffusion process on the union of continuous representation space and discrete token space, using a single model to simultaneously denoise in both spaces. Also develop effective architectures and training/sampling techniques.

Result: CCDD demonstrates strong empirical performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks, achieving both expressiveness with rich semantics in latent space and good trainability with explicit discrete tokens.

Conclusion: By combining continuous and discrete modalities through joint multimodal diffusion, CCDD successfully bridges the gap between theoretical expressivity and practical trainability, delivering superior performance in language modeling tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.
