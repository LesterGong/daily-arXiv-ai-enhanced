However, naively\napplying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We\nargue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are\nasked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not\nreally see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for\nsemantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,\nleaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable\nperceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited\nvisual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically\nuses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,\nheterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful\nvisual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting\nin catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue\ncapabilities).

Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the\ntime-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small\nMLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the\nlatent vector.
