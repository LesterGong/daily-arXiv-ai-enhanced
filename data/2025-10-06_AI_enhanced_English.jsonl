This\npaper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to\nprocess multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic\nsegmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts\nfor drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from\ninstrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to\nreal-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded\npositioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and\ndriver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban\ndriving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's\neffectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such\nas proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper\nhighlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting\nboth transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet\ncoordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.\n  Index Terms - Electric vehicles, visual perception, large language models,\nYOLOv8, semantic segmentation, CAN bus, prompt engineering, smart grid.", "AI": {"tldr": "A multi-modal LLM framework that processes vehicle sensor data to generate natural-language safety alerts for drivers, validated with real-world urban driving data.", "motivation": "To address the challenge of ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers, vehicles, and the environment in EV-integrated smart grids.", "method": "Combines visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded positioning, and CAN bus telemetry through a multi-modal LLM framework to process sensor data and generate driver alerts.", "result": "Validated with real-world urban driving data; demonstrated effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations involving pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles.", "conclusion": "LLMs show potential as assistive tools in e-mobility, enabling safer driving decisions and supporting smart grid applications like fleet coordination and energy planning."}}

Recently, various multimodal entity\nlinking (MEL) techniques have been proposed, targeted to learn comprehensive\nembeddings by leveraging both text and vision modalities. The selection of\nhigh-quality negative samples can potentially play a crucial role in\nmetric/representation learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, this\npossibility remains unexplored in existing literature within the framework of\nMEL. To fill this gap, we address the multimodal entity linking problem in a\ngenerative adversarial setting where the generator is responsible for\ngenerating high-quality negative samples, and the discriminator is assigned the\nresponsibility for the metric learning tasks. Since the generator is involved\nin generating samples, which is a discrete process, we optimize it using policy\ngradient techniques and propose a policy gradient-based generative adversarial\nnetwork for multimodal entity linking (PGMEL). Experimental results based on\nWiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets demonstrate that PGMEL learns\nmeaningful representation by selecting challenging negative samples and\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes PGMEL, a generative adversarial network using policy gradient for multimodal entity linking that generates high-quality negative samples to improve representation learning.", "motivation": "Existing multimodal entity linking methods don't explore the potential of high-quality negative sample selection, which is crucial for metric learning.", "method": "Uses generative adversarial setting with generator creating negative samples and discriminator handling metric learning, optimized via policy gradient for discrete sample generation.", "result": "Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets by learning meaningful representations through challenging negative samples.", "conclusion": "PGMEL effectively addresses the gap in negative sample selection for multimodal entity linking and demonstrates superior performance through adversarial learning with policy gradient optimization."}}
