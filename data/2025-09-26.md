### [1] [Leveraging NTPs for Efficient Hallucination Detection in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20379)
*Ofir Azachi,Kfir Eliyahu,Eyal El Ani,Rom Himelstein,Roi Reichart,Yuval Pinter,Nitay Calderon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an efficient on-the-fly method for detecting hallucinations in vision-language models (VLMs) using next-token probabilities (NTPs) as features for lightweight ML models, achieving comparable performance to strong VLMs with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in VLMs undermine their reliability, and current detection methods using VLMs themselves are computationally intensive and increase model latency. The authors aim to develop a more efficient detection approach.

Method: The authors train traditional ML models using features based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs), which quantify model uncertainty. They introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements and test NTP-based features, augmented with linguistic NTPs and VLM hallucination prediction scores.

Result: NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to strong VLMs. Augmenting with linguistic NTPs and VLM scores further enhances detection performance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that lightweight NTP-based solutions can effectively detect VLM hallucinations, paving the way for simple, efficient methods to enhance VLM reliability without heavy computational overhead.

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

### [2] [Quasi-Synthetic Riemannian Data Generation for Writer-Independent Offline Signature Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20420)
*Elias N. Zois,Moises Diaz,Salem Said,Miguel A. Ferrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A quasi-synthetic data generation framework using Riemannian geometry for offline handwritten signature verification that achieves low error rates in writer-independent settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline handwritten signature verification is challenging in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across unseen individuals. Existing methods depend on real-world signature datasets, which can be limited.

Method: Leverages Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD) to generate synthetic data. Uses a small set of genuine samples to create a Riemannian Gaussian Mixture that identifies synthetic writers and their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling generates positive and negative synthetic SPD populations for metric learning.

Result: Experiments on Western and Asian signature datasets show the approach achieves low error rates under both intra- and cross-dataset evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: The quasi-synthetic approach demonstrates the potential of generating synthetic data in Riemannian spaces for effective writer-independent signature verification systems.

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seedream 4.0 is an efficient multimodal image generation system that unifies text-to-image synthesis, image editing, and multi-image composition using a diffusion transformer with optimized VAE, achieving fast high-resolution image generation and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend traditional text-to-image systems into more interactive and multidimensional creative tools by unifying multiple image generation tasks within a single framework, pushing the boundaries of generative AI for both creativity and professional applications.

Method: Developed a highly efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE that reduces image tokens, enabling efficient training and fast native high-resolution image generation.

Demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in complex tasks including precise image editing, in-context reasoning, multi-image reference, and multiple output image generation.

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0 successfully extends traditional T2I systems into a more interactive and multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both creativity and professional applications, with the system now publicly accessible.

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on

### [4] [A Contrastive Learning Framework for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20474)
*Samia Saeed,Khuram Naveed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Contrastive Learning framework using ResNet-50 for breast cancer detection in mammograms, achieving 96.7% accuracy on benchmark datasets despite limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer is a major global health concern where early detection is crucial. Deep learning methods show promise but struggle with accuracy due to limited labeled datasets. The study aims to address this challenge by leveraging contrastive learning to work effectively with smaller labeled datasets.

Method: The study uses a semi-supervised Contrastive Learning approach with ResNet-50 architecture. It trains on large amounts of unlabeled mammogram data using similarity index and various augmentation techniques, then fine-tunes on a small set of labeled data.

Result: The proposed method achieves 96.7% accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The Contrastive Learning framework effectively addresses the challenge of limited labeled data in medical imaging, demonstrating superior performance in breast cancer detection and showing promise for applications where large annotated datasets are scarce.

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

### [5] [Are Foundation Models Ready for Industrial Defect Recognition? A Reality Check on Real-World Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20479)
*Simon Baeuerle,Pratik Khanna,Nils Friederich,Angelo Jovin Yamachui Sitcheu,Damir Shakirov,Andreas Steimer,Ralf Mikut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation Models (FMs) show promise for automated quality inspection in manufacturing but fail on real-world industrial data despite performing well on public benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage FMs' zero-shot generalization capabilities for automated quality inspection in series manufacturing, replacing tedious labeling tasks with simple text prompts and enabling model reuse across products.

Method: Testing multiple recent Foundation Models on both custom real-world industrial image data and public image datasets to evaluate their performance in zero-shot anomaly detection.

Result: All tested Foundation Models failed on real-world industrial data, while performing well on public benchmark datasets, revealing a significant performance gap.

Conclusion: Current Foundation Models are not yet suitable for real-world industrial quality inspection applications despite their strong performance on public benchmarks, highlighting the need for domain-specific adaptations.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

### [6] [Shared Neural Space: Unified Precomputed Feature Encoding for Multi-Task and Cross Domain Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20481)
*Jing Li,Oskar Bartosz,Chengyu Wang,Michal Wnuczynski,Dilshan Godaliyadda,Michael Polley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a universal Neural Space (NS) using an encoder-decoder framework to create shared feature representations across multiple vision tasks, reducing redundancy and improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models are inefficient for applications requiring multiple modular tasks, as each task requires mapping to different latent domains, leading to redundancy and poor generalization across domain shifts.

Method: A lightweight CNN-based encoder-decoder framework that pre-computes transformation-aware, generalizable features in a shared Neural Space, enabling multiple downstream AI modules to operate in the same feature space.

Result: The proposed architecture successfully performs various imaging and vision tasks (demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation, semantic segmentation) efficiently in the shared Neural Space, demonstrating reduced redundancy and improved generalization.

Conclusion: The universal Neural Space establishes an efficient foundation for multi-task vision pipelines, offering better performance than task-specific models while being lightweight and hardware-friendly compared to larger transformer backbones.

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

*Dani Manjah,Tim Bary,Benoît Gérin,Benoît Macq,Christophe de Vleeschouwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores efficient image selection strategies for training edge device models using teacher-student framework, showing that combining high-confidence stream-based selection with diversity-based approach produces high-quality models with minimal data queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge camera systems need regular model updates but face computational constraints. Current practice uses central server teacher models to annotate data for training smaller edge models, but this requires efficient image selection to minimize transmission costs while maximizing model quality.

Method: Proposes a strategy combining high-confidence stream-based image selection with diversity-based approach to select the most useful training images while keeping transmission costs low.

Result: For similar training iterations, the combined high-confidence stream-based and diversity-based approach produces high-quality models with minimal dataset queries.

Conclusion: The proposed image selection strategy effectively balances model quality and transmission efficiency for edge device training, demonstrating that careful data selection can significantly reduce annotation costs while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

### [8] [InstructVTON: Optimal Auto-Masking and Natural-Language-Guided Interactive Style Control for Inpainting-Based Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20524)
*Julien Han,Shuwen Qiu,Qi Li,Xingzi Xu,Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu,Kavosh Asadi,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructVTON is an instruction-following virtual try-on system that uses natural language to control garment styling, eliminating the need for manual mask creation by leveraging Vision Language Models and image segmentation for automated mask generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional virtual try-on models require precise binary masks that are difficult to create, model-dependent, and insufficient for complex styling instructions like 'sleeves rolled up'. The motivation is to simplify user experience and enable more complex styling controls through natural language.

Method: Leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation models to automatically generate binary masks based on user images and free-text style instructions. The system is interoperable with existing virtual try-on models and automates multiple rounds of image generation for complex scenarios.

Result: InstructVTON achieves state-of-the-art results with styling control, enabling fine-grained and complex styling that traditional masking-based approaches cannot handle. It simplifies the user experience by removing the need for precisely drawn masks.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates that instruction-following virtual try-on with automated mask generation can overcome limitations of traditional masking-based approaches, providing more flexible and user-friendly garment try-on experiences with complex styling capabilities.

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

*Dana A Abdullah,Dana Rasul Hamad,Bishar Rasheed Ibrahim,Sirwan Abdulwahid Aula,Aso Khaleel Ameen,Sabat Salih Hamadamin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAFRNet is a deep learning model that recognizes altered fingerprints using VGG16 backbone and cosine similarity, achieving high accuracy on real altered fingerprint datasets with strict thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Altered fingerprint recognition is challenging but essential for security applications like border control and forensics, as adversaries can modify ridge patterns to evade detection.

Method: Uses VGG16 backbone to extract high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings, evaluated on SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).

Result: With strict thresholds (0.92), achieves 96.7%, 98.76%, and 99.54% accuracy for Easy, Medium, Hard levels respectively. Threshold relaxation to 0.72 degrades accuracy to 7.86%, 27.05%, 29.51%.

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet addresses limitations of prior synthetic alteration approaches, demonstrates readiness for real-world deployments where security and recognition resilience are critical, highlighting importance of threshold selection.

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance bimanual robotic manipulation by incorporating semantic cues from pre-trained vision models into voxel-based representations.

Method: Extract attention maps from DINOv2 (self-supervised ViT), interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores, lift them into 3D voxel grids, and integrate into behavior cloning policy.

Result: 8.2% absolute improvement and 21.9% relative gain across all tasks in RLBench bimanual benchmark.

Conclusion: Attention-guided featurization from pre-trained vision models significantly enhances voxel-based robotic manipulation policies.

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic
manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a
self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

### [11] [A Comparative Benchmark of Real-time Detectors for Blueberry Detection towards Precision Orchard Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20580)
*Xinyang Mu,Yuzhen Lu,Boyang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a comparative benchmark of real-time object detectors (YOLO v8-v12 and RT-DETR v1-v2 families) for blueberry detection, evaluated on a new dataset of 661 canopy images with 85,879 labeled instances. The study also explores semi-supervised learning using unlabeled data to improve detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blueberry detection in natural environments is challenging due to variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur. Deep learning detectors need large, diverse datasets and optimal accuracy/speed/memory trade-offs for practical deployment.

Method: Evaluated 36 model variants on a curated dataset of 661 canopy images with 85,879 labeled blueberries. Applied Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning on 1,035 unlabeled images to enhance detection performance.

Result: YOLOv12m achieved best YOLO accuracy (mAP@50: 93.3%), RT-DETRv2-X achieved highest overall (mAP@50: 93.6%). SSL fine-tuning improved RT-DETR-v2-X to 94.8% mAP@50. Mid-sized models offered best accuracy-speed balance.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive benchmark for blueberry detection, with RT-DETR-v2-X achieving state-of-the-art performance after SSL. More SSL research is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Dataset and software are publicly available.

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

### [12] [Region-of-Interest Augmentation for Mammography Classification under Patient-Level Cross-Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20585)
*Farbod Bigdeli,Mohsen Mohammadagha,Ali Bigdeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight ROI augmentation strategy for mammography classification that probabilistically replaces full images with random ROI crops during training, showing modest performance improvements on the Mini-DDSM dataset without increasing inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer screening with mammography is crucial for early detection, but deep learning approaches face limitations due to restricted-resolution datasets and small sample sizes that constrain performance.

Method: A lightweight region-of-interest augmentation strategy where full images are probabilistically replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free bounding-box bank during training, with optional jitter for variability. Evaluation uses strict patient-level cross-validation.

Result: ROI augmentation (best parameters: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest average ROC-AUC gains with varying performance across folds, while PR-AUC remains flat to slightly lower. Training-time efficiency metrics show the method maintains throughput and GPU memory usage.

Conclusion: Simple, data-centric ROI strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications, while keeping inference-time costs unchanged.

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

### [13] [Reflect3r: Single-View 3D Stereo Reconstruction Aided by Mirror Reflections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20607)
*Jing Wu,Zirui Wang,Iro Laina,Victor Adrian Prisacariu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for 3D reconstruction from single images containing mirror reflections by treating reflections as auxiliary views and constructing physically valid virtual cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mirror reflections provide stereo information within a single capture, allowing multi-view stereo setups from single images without complex imaging processes.

Method: The method treats reflections as auxiliary views, designs transformations to construct physically valid virtual cameras, uses symmetric-aware loss for pose refinement, and extends to dynamic scenes with per-frame geometry recovery.

Result: The framework enables generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction, works with dynamic scenes, and is validated through extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic data.

Conclusion: Mirror reflections can be effectively exploited for 3D reconstruction from single images, simplifying the imaging process while maintaining compatibility with powerful reconstruction models.

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are

TL;DR: FacadeTrack is a street-level framework that uses language-guided panoramic video analysis to assess building occupancy after disasters, achieving high precision and recall through interpretable attribute detection and two decision strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for post-disaster building occupancy assessment have limitations - overhead imagery misses facade details while street-view imagery is sparse and hard to align with parcels. There's a need for scalable, interpretable occupancy assessment that captures critical facade and access cues.

Method: FacadeTrack links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies views to facades, and extracts interpretable attributes (entry blockage, temporary coverings, debris). It uses two decision strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design separating perception from conservative reasoning.

Result: Evaluated on post-Hurricane Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieved precision of 0.927, recall of 0.781, F-1 score of 0.848, outperforming the one-stage baseline (precision 0.943, recall 0.728, F-1 0.822). Intermediate attributes provide spatial diagnostics for error analysis.

Conclusion: FacadeTrack provides auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for emergency management workflows, with interpretable attributes enabling targeted quality control and explaining where and why errors occur.

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

*Yiling Yun,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines how humans perceive social interactions from moving shapes, finding that semantic representations complement visual features, with verb-based embeddings best explaining human similarity judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what semantic representations humans use alongside visual features when recognizing social interactions from simple animations of moving shapes.

Method: Study 1: Direct labeling of animations by human participants. Study 2: Measuring representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity judgments and comparing with model predictions based on visual features, labels, and semantic embeddings.

Result: Human responses were distributed in Study 1. Semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in explaining human judgments, with verb-based embeddings from descriptions accounting for human similarity judgments the best.

Conclusion: Social perception in simple displays reflects the semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract representations.

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

*Xiaowei Wang,Di Wang,Ke Li,Yifeng Wang,Chengjian Wang,Libin Sun,Zhihong Wu,Yiming Zhang,Quan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EGS is a novel cross-view geo-localization framework that uses E(2)-Steerable CNN and graph-based global-local consistency to improve robustness against viewpoint variations and enhance cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVGL methods struggle with severe appearance variations from different UAV orientations/fields of view (hindering cross-domain generalization) and lack reliable correspondences that capture both global semantics and local details.

Method: Proposes EGS framework with E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder for rotation/viewpoint-invariant features, and a graph structure with virtual super-node that connects to all local nodes to aggregate global semantics and enforce global-local consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks show EGS achieves substantial performance gains and establishes new state-of-the-art in cross-domain CVGL.

Conclusion: EGS effectively addresses cross-domain generalization challenges in CVGL through steerable features and global-local consistency, demonstrating superior performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

### [17] [DENet: Dual-Path Edge Network with Global-Local Attention for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20701)
*Jiayi Zuo,Songwei Pei,Qian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Dual-Path Edge Network for infrared small target detection that decouples edge enhancement and semantic modeling to address the conflict between capturing spatial details and extracting semantic context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small targets lack distinctive features and blend into noisy backgrounds, creating a fundamental challenge between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, which existing methods fail to address adequately.

Method: Proposes a Dual-Path Edge Network with two complementary paths: (1) Bidirectional Interaction Module using Local and Global Self-Attention for multi-scale feature dependencies and semantic modeling, and (2) Multi-Edge Refiner using cascaded Taylor finite difference operators with attention-driven gating for precise edge localization and noise suppression.

Result: The method provides precise infrared small target detection and localization by effectively combining structural semantics and edge refinement.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework offers a promising solution for infrared small target detection by addressing the inherent conflict between spatial detail preservation and semantic context extraction through complementary edge enhancement and semantic modeling paths.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

*Ruixu Zhang,Yuran Wang,Xinyi Hu,Chaoyu Mai,Wenxuan Liu,Danni Xu,Xian Zhong,Zheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces group intention forecasting (GIF) to predict when collective intentions emerge from individual actions, presents the SHOT dataset for basketball scenarios, and proposes the GIFT framework for modeling group dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional intention recognition focuses on individual intentions but overlooks the complexities of collective intentions in group settings, creating a gap in understanding how shared goals emerge through multiple individuals' actions and interactions.

Method: The authors propose SHOT (a large-scale basketball video dataset with 1,979 clips from 5 camera views) and GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer framework) that extracts individual features and models evolving group dynamics to forecast intention emergence.

Result: Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of both SHOT dataset and GIFT framework, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group intention forecasting.

Conclusion: The work successfully addresses the limitation of individual-focused intention recognition by introducing group intention forecasting, providing both a comprehensive dataset and effective framework for studying emerging collective intentions in multi-individual settings.

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neptune-X is a data-centric generative-selection framework that addresses maritime object detection challenges by generating diverse synthetic maritime data and intelligently selecting task-relevant samples to improve detection accuracy in underrepresented scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maritime object detection faces two main challenges: scarcity of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across diverse maritime attributes (object category, viewpoint, location, imaging environment), especially in underrepresented scenarios like open-sea environments.

Method: Proposes Neptune-X framework with two key components: 1) X-to-Maritime generative model with Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module for realistic maritime scene synthesis, and 2) Attribute-correlated Active Sampling for dynamic selection of task-relevant synthetic samples. Also constructs Maritime Generation Dataset for benchmarking.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach sets new benchmarks in maritime scene synthesis and significantly improves detection accuracy, particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.

Conclusion: The proposed Neptune-X framework effectively addresses maritime data scarcity and generalization issues through synthetic data generation and intelligent sample selection, demonstrating substantial improvements in maritime object detection performance.

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

*Sofia McLeod,Chee-Kheng Chng,Matthew Rodda,Tat-Jun Chin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STELLA is the first end-to-end Crater-Based Navigation pipeline for long-duration lunar mapping missions, achieving metre-level position and sub-degree attitude accuracy across varying conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CBN methods focus on short-duration landing missions with nadir views, but lunar mapping involves sparse, oblique imagery under varying illumination over year-long campaigns, requiring new solutions.

Method: Combines Mask R-CNN crater detector, descriptor-less crater identification, robust perspective-n-crater pose solver, and batch orbit determination back-end. Tested on CRESENT-365 dataset simulating year-long missions.

Result: Maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination conditions, and lunar latitudes.

Conclusion: First comprehensive assessment of CBN in true lunar mapping setting, informing operational conditions for future missions.

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

*Zoe Wanying He,Sean Trott,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep vision-only and language-only models trained on disjoint modalities develop partially aligned representational spaces, with alignment peaking in mid-to-late layers and reflecting semantic rather than appearance-based convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand where alignment emerges in unimodal networks, what cues support it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios, and how exemplar aggregation affects alignment.

Method: Systematic investigation of alignment patterns across network layers, testing robustness to semantic vs. appearance changes, forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task with human preferences, and analysis of embedding averaging effects.

Result: Alignment peaks in mid-to-late layers, is robust to appearance changes but collapses with semantic alterations, mirrors human preferences bidirectionally, and is amplified by embedding averaging rather than blurred.

Conclusion: Unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation, demonstrating meaningful cross-modal alignment without explicit multimodal training.

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

*Yuhong Zhang,Han Wang,Yiwen Wang,Rong Xie,Li Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeInsert is a training-free framework that enables geometrically controlled and style-consistent object insertion into images by leveraging 3D generation models and diffusion adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods lack geometric control over inserted objects (confined to 2D space), struggle with style consistency between objects and backgrounds, and require extensive training for object insertion tasks.

Method: Converts 2D objects into 3D using existing 3D generation models, performs interactive editing at 3D level, then re-renders to 2D from specified views. Combines geometric control with style and content control through diffusion adapters.

Result: The framework produces geometrically controlled and style-consistent edited images without requiring training, addressing limitations of current 2D-based editing methods.

Conclusion: FreeInsert provides an effective solution for personalized image composition by introducing 3D geometric information to overcome the geometric control and style consistency challenges in object insertion tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement framework that improves identity customization models by leveraging face swapping and triple-flow fusion to achieve better scene diversity, identity fidelity, and training-free control, while introducing ResInversion for 129x faster inversion than NTI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models for human photo synthesis face degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity, requiring improvements in identity fidelity and control mechanisms.

Method: CustomEnhancer uses face swapping techniques and pretrained diffusion models to obtain additional representations in zero-shot manner. It employs triple-flow fused PerGeneration to combine counter-directional latent spaces and manipulate personalized models, along with ResInversion for efficient noise rectification via pre-diffusion.

Result: Experiments show CustomEnhancer achieves state-of-the-art results in scene diversity, identity fidelity, and training-free controls, with ResInversion reducing inversion time by 129 times compared to null-text inversion.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances existing identity customization models with improved generation quality, comprehensive control, and significant efficiency gains, making it a promising solution for realistic human photo synthesis.

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

### [25] [Dual-supervised Asymmetric Co-training for Semi-supervised Medical Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20785)
*Jincai Song,Haipeng Chen,Jun Qin,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DAC, a dual-supervised asymmetric co-training framework for cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization (CD-SSDG) in medical image segmentation, addressing domain shifts between labeled/unlabeled training data and training/testing sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for each source domain, but in practice, domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training data. This creates inaccurate pseudolabels and sub-optimal performance.

Method: DAC framework builds on co-training with two sub-models providing cross pseudo supervision, plus feature-level supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks. Feature-level supervision addresses inaccurate pseudo supervision from domain shifts, while auxiliary tasks enhance domain-invariant feature learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM medical image datasets demonstrate robust generalizability of the DAC framework in CD-SSDG scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed DAC framework effectively handles the challenging CD-SSDG scenario where domain shifts exist between labeled/unlabeled training data and training/testing sets, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

*Shihua Huang,Yongjie Hou,Longfei Liu,Xuanlong Yu,Xi Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEIMv2 extends DEIM with DINOv3 features, creating a unified framework that achieves superior performance-cost trade-offs across eight model sizes from X to Atto, establishing new state-of-the-art results in real-time object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the successful DEIM framework with DINOv3 features to create a more efficient and scalable real-time object detection system that covers diverse deployment scenarios from GPU to mobile devices.

Method: For larger models (X, L, M, S): uses DINOv3-pretrained/distilled backbones with Spatial Tuning Adapter (STA) to convert single-scale to multi-scale features. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, Atto): employs HGNetv2 with depth/width pruning, simplified decoder, and upgraded Dense O2O.

Result: DEIMv2-X achieves 57.8 AP with 50.3M parameters (surpassing prior X-scale models needing 60M+ for 56.5 AP). DEIMv2-S is first sub-10M model (9.71M) to exceed 50 AP (50.9 AP). DEIMv2-Pico (1.5M) delivers 38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3M) with 50% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: DEIMv2 establishes new state-of-the-art results across diverse model sizes, demonstrating superior performance-cost trade-offs and significantly outperforming the YOLO series in real-time object detection.

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

*Ved Umrajkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAC-LoRA is a novel framework that integrates adversarial training into Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA, using a dynamic curriculum of progressively challenging attacks to enhance robustness of Vision-Language Models without compromising clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are critical for safety-sensitive applications but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. CLIP, as a backbone for many VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem.

Method: Dynamic Adversarial Curriculum (DAC-LoRA) framework that uses intelligent curriculum of progressively challenging attacks guided by First-Order Stationary Condition (FOSC) and TRADES-inspired loss, integrated into standard PEFT pipelines.

Result: Achieves substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy. The method is lightweight, effective, and broadly applicable.

Conclusion: DAC-LoRA presents an effective and easily integrable framework that significantly enhances robustness of VLMs through adversarial training integrated with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

*Jianhan Wu,Xiaoyang Qu,Zhangcheng Huang,Jianzong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedDSPG is a novel federated domain generalization method that generates domain-specific soft prompts from a generative perspective to handle domain shifts in unseen target domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated domain generalization methods based on prompt learning have limited diversity and ignore information from unknown domains, posing challenges for downstream-task adaptation in federated learning settings.

Method: Introduces domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain, integrates content and domain knowledge into a generative model across clients, and uses the generator to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains during inference.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations across several public datasets confirm that FedDSPG outperforms existing strong baselines in federated domain generalization, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The proposed FedDSPG method effectively addresses the limitations of existing prompt learning approaches in federated domain generalization by generating diverse domain-specific soft prompts for unknown domains.

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoisonVID is a black-box poisoning attack that compromises prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs by using a closed-loop optimization strategy to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, achieving 82-99% attack success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While vulnerabilities have been identified in earlier frame sampling strategies (uniform-based and semantic-similarity-based), the safety of the latest prompt-guided sampling strategies in VideoLLMs remains unexplored.

Method: PoisonVID uses a closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores. It leverages a depiction set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions using a shadow VideoLLM and GPT-4o-mini.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation on three prompt-guided sampling strategies across three advanced VideoLLMs shows PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate.

Conclusion: The high success rate of PoisonVID highlights the importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs that are more robust to such attacks.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GoR is a novel learnable regularization method that adaptively balances task-specific and knowledge distillation losses in quantization-aware training, improving performance of small quantized models across various AI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QAT-KD methods struggle to balance task-specific and distillation losses due to heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization, leading to performance degradation.

Method: Game of Regularizer (GoR) uses only two trainable parameters for dynamic loss weighting, reducing conflict between supervision signals. Also introduces QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework using multiple heterogeneous teacher models.

Result: GoR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods on image classification, object detection, and LLM compression. On edge devices, it delivers faster inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. EKD-GoR can even outperform full-precision models under optimal conditions.

Conclusion: GoR provides a robust solution for real-world deployment of compressed AI models, effectively balancing quantization and distillation objectives to achieve superior performance on resource-constrained hardware.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The LifeCLEF 2017 plant identification challenge compared web-collected noisy training data vs expert-curated clean data for automated plant identification across 10,000 species using 1.1M images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether large-scale web-sourced training data with labeling errors can compete with smaller expert-verified datasets for continental-scale plant identification systems.

Method: Used two training datasets: one large noisy web-collected dataset and one smaller expert-checked dataset, with testing on a third independent dataset from the Pl@ntNet mobile application.

Result: The challenge assessed performance of participating systems on plant identification accuracy using different training strategies and data sources.

Conclusion: The study provides analysis comparing web-sourced vs expert-curated training approaches for large-scale automated plant identification systems.

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

### [33] [TasselNetV4: A vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20857)
*Xiaonan Hu,Xuebing Li,Jinyu Xu,Abdulkadir Duran Adan,Letian Zhou,Xuhui Zhu,Yanan Li,Wei Guo,Shouyang Liu,Wenzhong Liu,Hao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TasselNetV4 is a vision foundation model for cross-species plant counting that combines local counting with extract-and-match paradigms, achieving superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art class-agnostic counting models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional plant counting models are species-specific, but plant biodiversity and new cultivars make it impossible to build models for all species. Current class-agnostic counting models perform poorly on plants due to their dynamic, non-rigid nature that changes with time and space.

Method: TasselNetV4 extends TasselNet by marrying local counting with extract-and-match paradigm from class-agnostic counting. It uses a plain vision transformer with novel multi-branch box-aware local counters to enhance cross-scale robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments on PAC-105 and PAC-Somalia datasets show TasselNetV4 achieves superior counting performance and high efficiency compared to state-of-the-art CAC models.

Conclusion: TasselNetV4 emerges as a vision foundation model capable of cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting, addressing the limitations of species-specific approaches.

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised model for retinal OCT segmentation that introduces a differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce anatomically correct segmentation of layers and lesions, improving performance while ensuring topological correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised methods for retinal OCT segmentation often produce anatomically implausible results, fail to model layer-lesion interactions effectively, and lack guarantees on topological correctness, limiting their clinical utility.

Method: Proposes a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine that enables joint learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions. The model learns disentangled representations separating spatial and style factors, and strictly enforces lesion locations relative to segmented layers.

Result: The model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on public and internal OCT datasets for both lesion and layer segmentation, and demonstrates generalization capability to pathological cases using partially annotated training data.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of using anatomical constraints in semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal biomarker segmentation in clinical applications.

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create realistic biodiversity monitoring scenarios by testing plant identification systems at large scale with real-world conditions, including the challenge of rejecting false positives from unknown plant species.

Method: Used a dataset built through participatory sensing involving tens of thousands of contributors since 2011, with evaluation conducted as an open-set recognition problem requiring systems to identify known species while rejecting unknown ones.

Result: The challenge successfully tested various identification approaches on a massive dataset, providing insights into robust plant recognition systems capable of handling real-world biodiversity monitoring conditions.

Conclusion: The LifeCLEF 2016 edition advanced plant identification research by introducing open-set recognition challenges, demonstrating the feasibility of large-scale biodiversity monitoring through participatory sensing and automated identification systems.

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCRA-VQA is a novel method that improves Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering by using summarized and reordered captions to help LLMs better understand images and questions, achieving state-of-the-art results without expensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods using LLMs for KB-VQA suffer from noisy image captions and LLMs' limited understanding of VQA tasks, which restricts their reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes SCRA-VQA which converts images to captions using a pre-trained visual language model, then generates contextual examples, summarizes and reorders captions to remove irrelevant information, enabling better LLM understanding without end-to-end training.

Result: Achieves 38.8% accuracy on OK-VQA and 34.6% on A-OKVQA using a 6.7B parameter LLM, demonstrating excellent performance on challenging KB-VQA datasets.

Conclusion: The caption-rerank process effectively enhances LLMs' reasoning ability and task adaptability in KB-VQA, providing a cost-effective alternative to expensive training methods.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

*Jiabei Zhang,Qi Wang,Siyu Wu,Du Chen,Tianhe Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reveals an asymmetry between perceptual optimization and image quality assessment (IQA), showing that fidelity metrics effective for IQA don't necessarily work well for optimization, especially under adversarial training. Discriminator design is crucial for optimization effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze the correlation between optimization objectives (fidelity and adversarial) and their capability as IQA metrics, which remains underexplored despite their central role in perceptual optimization.

Method: Conducted systematic analysis comparing fidelity metrics' effectiveness in IQA versus perceptual optimization, examined discriminator reuse for IQA model initialization, and evaluated different discriminator architectures (patch-level, convolutional, vanilla, Transformer-based).

Result: Found significant asymmetry: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are ineffective for perceptual optimization, especially under adversarial training. Discriminator representations offer limited benefits for IQA model initialization. Patch-level and convolutional discriminators provide better detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.

Conclusion: Discriminator design is decisive for optimization effectiveness, and there's a fundamental misalignment between perceptual optimization and assessment. These insights advance understanding of loss function design and IQA transferability, enabling more principled perceptual optimization approaches.

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA models struggle with biases from training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and poor generalization to diverse questions and images.

Method: The model integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention to capture complex object interactions and a GAN-Based Debiasing framework to generate unbiased data distributions for more robust feature learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets show excellent performance compared to existing methods, particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions.

Conclusion: The results highlight the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases for advancing VQA tasks, demonstrating IOG-VQA's effectiveness in combining visual and textual information to overcome inherent biases.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Nuclear Diffusion combines low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling for video dehazing, outperforming traditional RPCA methods in medical ultrasound imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robust principal component analysis (RPCA) methods fail to capture the rich variability in real video data due to their sparsity assumption, particularly when dealing with structured noise and background artifacts that obscure dynamic content in video sequences.

Method: A hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling, called Nuclear Diffusion, which combines model-based temporal models with deep generative priors.

Result: The method demonstrates improved dehazing performance on cardiac ultrasound imaging compared to traditional RPCA, with better contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation (KS statistic).

Conclusion: Combining model-based temporal models with deep generative priors shows strong potential for high-fidelity video restoration, particularly in medical imaging applications like cardiac ultrasound dehazing.

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

*Patrick Knab,Sascha Marton,Philipp J. Schubert,Drago Guggiana,Christian Bartelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoTIF extends Concept Bottleneck Models to video classification by handling temporal dependencies and providing interpretable concept-based explanations across different time scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend interpretable concept-based models from static images to video data, addressing the challenge of temporal dependencies essential for understanding actions and events in videos.

Method: Propose MoTIF, a transformer-inspired architecture that adapts concept bottleneck framework for video classification, handling sequences of arbitrary length and capturing recurring semantic concepts (motifs) across time.

Result: The concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively transferred to video data, enabling better understanding of concept contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: MoTIF successfully extends interpretable concept-based approaches to video classification, providing three complementary interpretability perspectives: global concept importance, local concept relevance, and temporal dependencies.

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

*Julius Pesonen,Arno Solin,Eija Honkavaara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Particle filter-based 3D object localization using camera sequences for drone wildfire monitoring, overcoming limitations of depth estimation and scene reconstruction for distant objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D localization methods (dense depth estimation, 3D reconstruction) fail for distant objects or computationally constrained tasks like drone-based wildfire monitoring.

Method: Uses particle filters for single and multiple target localization, tested with 3D simulation and drone image segmentation sequences using GNSS-based camera pose estimates.

Result: Particle filter successfully solves practical localization tasks where other methods fail, works with various detection methods, and enables drone wildfire monitoring with existing segmentation models.

Conclusion: Particle filters provide a flexible, effective solution for camera-based 3D object localization in resource-constrained scenarios like aerial surveillance.

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

*Qinfeng Zhu,Han Li,Liang He,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwinMamba is a novel framework that combines local Mamba-style scanning with global receptive fields to improve semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery by addressing Vision Mamba's limitation in capturing local features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba has global receptive field and low computational complexity but overlooks critical local features like textures and edges, which are essential for accurate segmentation in remote sensing data with complex scene structures and diverse object scales.

Method: SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning within shifted windows inspired by Swin Transformer. The first two stages perform local scanning for fine-grained details, while subsequent stages use global scanning for contextual information. Overlapping shifted windows enhance inter-region information exchange.

Result: Extensive experiments on LoveDA and ISPRS Potsdam datasets show that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery.

Conclusion: SwinMamba demonstrates effectiveness and potential as a superior solution for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery by effectively capturing both local and global features.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

*Wenhao Tang,Heng Fang,Ge Wu,Xiang Li,Ming-Ming Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pack-based multiple instance learning framework for computational pathology that addresses challenges of extreme sequence length variations in whole slide images by packing variable-length sequences into fixed-length ones for efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole slide images in computational pathology have extremely long and variable sequence lengths (200 to 200K), leading to high data heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods compromise training efficiency and optimization to preserve this heterogeneity under limited supervision.

Method: Proposes a pack-based MIL framework that packs multiple sampled variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones for batched training. Includes a residual branch that composes discarded features into a hyperslide with tailored labels, and an attention-driven downsampler to compress features and reduce redundancy.

Result: Achieves up to 8% accuracy improvement while using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI) benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant potential for addressing data challenges in computational pathology.

Conclusion: Focusing on data challenges in computational pathology holds significant potential in the era of foundation models. The proposed approach effectively addresses sequence length variations and limited supervision while improving both accuracy and training efficiency.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

*Akihisa Watanabe,Jiawei Ren,Li Siyao,Yichen Peng,Erwin Wu,Edgar Simo-Serra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimDiff is a simulator-constrained diffusion model that generates physically plausible human motion by integrating environment parameters directly into the denoising process, eliminating the need for computationally expensive simulator calls during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating physically plausible human motion use simulator-based motion projection layers, which are computationally expensive due to their sequential nature and prevent parallelization.

Method: The paper proposes SimDiff, which interprets simulator-based motion projection as guidance within the diffusion process and conditions the denoising on environment parameters (e.g., gravity, wind) to generate physically plausible motions efficiently.

Result: SimDiff generates physically plausible motions without repeated simulator calls at inference, provides fine-grained control over physical coefficients, and demonstrates compositional generalization to unseen combinations of environmental parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed SimDiff approach efficiently generates physically plausible human motion while offering control over physical parameters and generalizing to new environmental conditions, overcoming computational limitations of previous simulator-based methods.

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates architectural design choices that make vision models more robust to Gaussian noise, identifying four key patterns and providing theoretical explanations for why they work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian noise and convert empirical insights into actionable design rules for building more robust models.

Method: Extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained vision models, empirical identification of design patterns, and theoretical analysis including proofs about low-pass stem kernels, downsampling effects, pooling mechanisms, and Lipschitz bounds for CLIP ViTs.

Result: Identified four consistent design patterns: larger stem kernels, smaller input resolutions, average pooling, and supervised ViTs over CLIP ViTs, yielding up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6% accuracy gains. Provided theoretical explanations showing how these choices attenuate noise and reduce sensitivity.

Conclusion: The study disentangles robustness into interpretable modules, provides a theory explaining observed trends, and offers practical plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Method: PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping review systematically mapping SG research applications, methodological advancements, and future directions in surgery.

Result: Analysis shows rapid growth with a critical data divide: internal-view research uses real-world 2D video while external-view 4D modeling relies on simulated data. Specialized foundation models now outperform generalist large vision-language models in surgical contexts.

Conclusion: Surgical scene graphs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge enabling intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and training, despite persistent challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new

Motivation: To address the challenge of extracting insights from lengthy, multimodal financial advisory podcast videos (30-40 minutes) by developing an efficient summarization framework that enhances accessibility and interpretability.

Method: FASTER employs BLIP for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, Whisper-based transcription with speaker diarization, a modified DPO-based loss function with fact-checking, and a ranker-based retrieval mechanism to align keyframes with summarized content.

Result: Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability compared to LLMs and VLMs, establishing a new standard for multimodal summarization.

Conclusion: FASTER makes financial advisory content more accessible and actionable, supported by the Fin-APT dataset, and opens new avenues for research in multimodal summarization.

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to

TL;DR: ASD is an adaptor that enables cold-start SSL learners for deep image clustering without pretraining or prerequisites, achieving near-ground-truth performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL-integrated deep clustering methods require pretraining, clustering learning, or trained models as prerequisites, limiting flexible out-of-box application.

Method: Randomly sample pseudo-labeled data, use instance-level classifier to learn them, track class transitions to extract similarities, assign cluster-level labels, then trigger SSL learner on unlabeled data.

Result: Superior performance across benchmarks against latest deep image clustering methods, with only 1.33% accuracy gap on CIFAR-10 compared to SSL using ground-truth.

Conclusion: ASD enables flexible SSL application for clustering without prerequisites and can boost existing SSL-embedded methods.

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

TL;DR: SiNGER is a novel distillation framework that suppresses high-norm artifacts in Vision Transformers while preserving informative signals, improving student model performance through nullspace-guided feature refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers produce high-norm artifacts that degrade representation quality. When these features are distilled to students, artifacts dominate the objective, causing students to overfit to artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing gains from larger models.

Method: SiNGER uses singular nullspace-guided energy reallocation to refine teacher features. It leverages nullspace-guided perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts, implemented efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal structural modification.

Result: Extensive experiments show SiNGER consistently improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple downstream tasks and producing clearer, more interpretable representations.

Conclusion: SiNGER effectively addresses the trade-off between artifact suppression and signal preservation in knowledge distillation, enabling better transfer of knowledge from teacher to student models.

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

TL;DR: SNCE is a novel method for precise harmful concept erasure in text-to-image models by manipulating only a single neuron, achieving surgical precision while preserving image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models pose safety risks by generating harmful content, and existing concept erasure methods struggle with precise removal while maintaining image quality.

Method: Train a Sparse Autoencoder to map text embeddings into a sparse latent space, use modulated frequency scoring to identify harmful concept-specific neurons, and suppress their activations.

Result: SNCE achieves state-of-the-art concept erasure results, preserves generation capabilities for non-target concepts, and shows strong robustness against adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed single neuron-based approach enables precise and effective concept erasure with minimal disruption to overall model performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

*Andreas Gilson,Lukas Meyer,Oliver Scholz,Ute Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KD-SS is a lightweight sub-sampling algorithm for plant point clouds that preserves full resolution and works across different plant species and sensor modalities without requiring down-sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing plant organ segmentation methods are species-specific, sensor-dependent, and require extensive pre-processing and down-sampling, which limits their generalizability and accuracy.

Method: Proposes KD-SS algorithm for biological point cloud sub-sampling that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species, enabling segmentation of full-resolution point clouds without down-sampling.

Result: KD-SS combined with state-of-the-art segmentation models achieves satisfying results across different modalities (photogrammetry, laser triangulation, LiDAR) and various plant species.

Conclusion: KD-SS serves as a lightweight, resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation, regardless of species and sensor modality.

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

*Songyue Cai,Zongqian Wu,Yujie Mo,Liang Peng,Ping Hu,Xiaoshuang Shi,Xiaofeng Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mambo is a new FG-BG decomposition framework for few-shot out-of-distribution detection that addresses limitations of previous methods by using both refined local background similarity and local class similarity, with flexible patch selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FG-BG decomposition methods for FS-OOD detection suffer from low robustness due to over-reliance on local class similarity and fixed background patch extraction strategies.

Method: Proposes learning a background prompt to obtain local background similarity, refining it with local class similarity, and using patch self-calibrated tuning to flexibly select background patches based on sample diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments show Mambo achieves state-of-the-art performance in both OOD detection and near OOD detection settings on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Mambo effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods by reducing dependence on local class similarity and introducing flexible background extraction, demonstrating superior performance in FS-OOD detection.

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at

*Naga Venkata Sai Jitin Jami,Thomas Altstidl,Jonas Mueller,Jindong Li,Dario Zanca,Bjoern Eskofier,Heike Leutheuser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two novel stratification methods for image segmentation datasets to address biased evaluations from random splitting. IPS is a simple label-aware sampling method, while WDES is a genetic algorithm that minimizes Wasserstein distance to optimize label distribution similarity across splits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random dataset splitting in image segmentation often creates unrepresentative test sets, leading to biased evaluations and poor model generalization. Existing stratification methods for classification don't effectively handle the multi-label structure and class imbalance typical in segmentation tasks.

Method: Two approaches: Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS) - a straightforward label-aware sampling method; and Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES) - a genetic algorithm that minimizes Wasserstein distance to optimize label distribution similarity across dataset splits.

Result: WDES consistently produces more representative splits than random sampling across diverse segmentation tasks (street scenes, medical imaging, satellite imagery), leading to lower performance variance and improved model evaluation. WDES is particularly valuable for small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets.

Conclusion: WDES is proven globally optimal given enough generations and effectively addresses bias in segmentation dataset splitting, especially for challenging datasets where conventional strategies are most prone to bias.

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

*Riccardo La Grassa,Ignazio Gallo,Nicola Landro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EnGraf-Net is an end-to-end deep neural network that uses semantic associations structured as a taxonomy hierarchy as supervised signals for fine-grained classification, achieving competitive performance without requiring part annotations or cropping techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-grained classification models rely on part annotations or automatic cropping methods, which suffer from incomplete representation of local features. The authors propose leveraging semantic associations through taxonomy hierarchies to better distinguish highly similar classes.

Method: The EnGraf-Net model incorporates semantic associations structured as a taxonomy hierarchy as supervised signals within an end-to-end deep neural network framework. It operates without requiring manual part annotations or cropping techniques.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and FGVC-Aircraft datasets demonstrate EnGraf-Net's superiority over many existing fine-grained models and competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed taxonomy-based approach effectively leverages semantic associations for fine-grained classification, achieving strong performance without the need for part annotations or complex cropping methods, making it more practical and scalable.

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

*Kasper Cools,Clara Maathuis,Alexander M. van Oers,Claudia S. Hübner,Nikos Deligiannis,Marijke Vandewal,Geert De Cubber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks despite their robustness advantages over CNNs, with attack success rates varying significantly (40.04%-99.97%) across different ViT models, demonstrating cross-architectural transferability of attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the security vulnerabilities of Vision Transformers (ViTs) to evasion attacks, particularly adversarial patches, and examine whether attack techniques developed for CNNs can transfer to ViT architectures.

Method: Used Creases Transformation (CT) technique to design realistic adversarial patches that add subtle geometric distortions similar to natural clothing wrinkles. Tested transferability of CNN adversarial attacks on four fine-tuned ViT models for binary person classification tasks.

Result: Significant vulnerability variations observed: attack success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97% (facebook/dino-vitb16), with other models achieving 66.40% and 65.17%. Pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influenced model resilience.

Conclusion: Adversarial patches can successfully transfer from CNNs to ViTs, confirming cross-architectural vulnerability. ViTs are not inherently more robust to evasion attacks, and their security depends on pre-training strategies.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniTransfer is a novel architecture for precise and controllable video concept transfer using spatial and diffusion timestep decomposition with a progressive paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve fine-grained control over video concept transfer by decomposing videos into key components (foreground, background, motion flow) and the denoising process into granular stages for progressive guidance.

Method: Uses spatial decomposition into foreground subject, background, and motion flow; dual-to-single-stream DiT-based architecture; self-supervised pretraining with random masking; Chain-of-Prompt mechanism for timestep decomposition leveraging LLMs; and introduces OpenAnimal dataset.

Result: Extensive experiments show high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual fidelity and editability.

Conclusion: UniTransfer effectively achieves precise video concept transfer through progressive decomposition strategies and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTTS enhances MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during inference, mimicking human hierarchical attention by progressively refining focus on high-confidence regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM methods are limited by static perception stages, lacking the dynamic reasoning capabilities needed for human-level perception and understanding.

Method: Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS) employs Iterative Perception (ITP) mechanism with reinforcement learning and spatio-temporal supervision to optimize reasoning progressively.

Result: VTTS achieves remarkable improvements with over 5% average increase across 15+ benchmarks, outperforming robust baselines like Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B.

Conclusion: VTTS effectively enhances MLLM reasoning through iterative perception, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse video and spatio-temporal tasks.

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mammo-CLIP Dissect is a concept-based explainability framework that uses a mammography-specific vision-language model to analyze what deep learning models learn from mammography data, revealing how training data and fine-tuning affect concept learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding what DL models learn is crucial for safe AI deployment in clinical settings. Previous work focused on pixel-based methods, but textual concepts may better reflect clinical reasoning.

Method: Leverages Mammo-CLIP as a "dissector" to label neurons with human-interpretable textual concepts and quantify their alignment to domain knowledge. Investigates concept learning differences between general vs mammography-trained models, fine-tuning effects, and underrepresented concepts.

Result: Mammography-trained models capture more clinically relevant concepts and align better with radiologists' workflows. Fine-tuning enhances certain concept categories but reduces coverage of others, showing a trade-off between specialization and generalization.

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights into how CNNs capture mammography-specific knowledge, revealing how domain-specific training and task adaptation shape concept learning in clinical AI models.

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

TL;DR: MOSS-ChatV is a reinforcement learning framework with DTW-based process reward that addresses process inconsistency in video reasoning for MLLMs, achieving 87.2% on MOSS-Video benchmark and improved performance on general video benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs exhibit process inconsistency where intermediate reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when final answers are correct, undermining interpretability and robustness in video reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduces MOSS-ChatV with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based process reward that aligns reasoning traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process supervision without auxiliary reward models. Also constructs MOSS-Video benchmark with annotated reasoning traces.

Result: Achieves 87.2% on MOSS-Video test split, improves performance on MVBench and MMVU benchmarks, and shows consistent gains across different architectures (Qwen2.5-VL, Phi-2). GPT-4o-as-judge evaluations confirm more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

Conclusion: The DTW-based process reward framework effectively addresses process inconsistency in video reasoning, demonstrating broad applicability across different MLLM architectures and producing more interpretable reasoning traces.

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARINOX is a unified framework that combines noise optimization and exploration with principled reward selection to improve compositional alignment in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving significant performance gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often fail to achieve compositional alignment for complex prompts. Existing inference-time approaches have limitations: optimization can stall due to poor initialization, while exploration requires too many samples. Single reward metrics also fail to capture all aspects of compositionality.

Method: CARINOX combines noise optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure based on correlation with human judgments. It addresses the limitations of using either optimization or exploration alone.

Result: CARINOX achieves +16% average alignment improvement on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on HRS benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods across all major categories while preserving image quality and diversity.

Conclusion: The unified framework effectively addresses compositional alignment challenges in text-to-image generation by combining optimization and exploration with human-aligned reward selection.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce
high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional
alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships,
attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address
this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward
functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning.
While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone:
optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search
trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of
samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that
neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all
aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To
overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise
Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise
optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure
grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary
benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises
average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS
benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and
exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image
quality and diversity. The project page is available at

TL;DR: A novel approach for video generation guided by camera trajectories that integrates both camera and object motions by converting them into pixel motion, using stable diffusion networks and semantic object priors to achieve superior consistency and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with consistency and generalizability when generating videos with both camera and object motions, often learning motions separately which causes confusion about relative motion between camera and objects.

Method: Proposes integrating camera and object motions by converting them into pixel motion, using stable diffusion network to learn reference motion maps relative to camera trajectory, and feeding these maps with semantic object prior into an image-to-video network.

Result: Extensive experiments show the model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in generating videos that accurately follow designated camera trajectories while maintaining consistent object motions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the challenge of generating consistent videos with both camera and object motions by unifying motion representation and leveraging stable diffusion networks.

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes when discriminators are most disadvantaged in detecting synthetic images, focusing on data dimensionality and complexity. It finds that both very simple and highly complex datasets reduce detectability, while intermediate-complexity datasets are most favorable for detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred boundaries between synthetic and real images, creating an arms race between generators and discriminators. The paper aims to understand the conditions under which discriminators are most disadvantaged.

Method: The study analyzes two key factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. Using Kolmogorov complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, the researchers examine how different levels of complexity affect the detectability of synthetic images.

Result: Both very simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic images. Generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, while extreme diversity masks imperfections. Intermediate-complexity datasets create the most favorable conditions for detection.

Conclusion: The detectability of synthetic images follows a U-shaped curve relative to dataset complexity - hardest to detect at both extremes (very simple and highly complex datasets), and easiest to detect at intermediate complexity levels where generators fail to fully capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient inference in vision-language models by supporting multiple resolutions within a single model and allowing adaptive computation based on confidence.

Method: Replaces standard patch embeddings with multi-level wavelet decomposition, uses key-value caching and causal cross-level attention for computation reuse, and employs confidence-based gating for adaptive early exits.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy with significant computational savings, requiring only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher.

Conclusion: WAVECLIP provides an effective approach for adaptive resolution inference that enables dynamic compute-accuracy trade-offs using a single deployed model.

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

Motivation: To understand the impact of quantization on CLIP models beyond just accuracy, particularly focusing on reliability metrics like calibration and OOD detection, which are crucial for efficient and safe deployment.

Method: Large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing in-distribution accuracy, calibration, and OOD detection metrics, including analysis of quantization-aware training (QAT) methods.

Result: Quantization consistently improves calibration for underconfident pre-trained models but degrades it for overconfident ones. However, OOD detection can still improve even with degraded calibration. Specific QAT methods achieve simultaneous improvements in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness.

Conclusion: Quantization can be strategically used to enhance multiple reliability aspects of VLMs beyond conventional efficiency gains, offering new deployment strategies for efficient, reliable, and robust models.

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

*Iñigo Alonso,Imanol Miranda,Eneko Agirre,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TABLET is a large-scale visual table understanding dataset with 4 million examples across 20 tasks, featuring real-world table visualizations and paired image-HTML representations to address limitations of synthetic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VTU benchmarks use synthetic renderings lacking real-world complexity, and existing datasets offer fixed examples without access to underlying data for reformulation.

Method: Created TABLET dataset with 4M examples from 2M unique tables (88% original visualizations), including image-HTML pairs, metadata, and provenance. Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-7B on this dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning on TABLET improves performance on both seen and unseen VTU tasks and increases robustness on real-world table visualizations.

Conclusion: TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and extensible evaluation of future VTU models by preserving original visualizations and maintaining traceability.

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

### [70] [Learning Conformal Explainers for Image Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21209)
*Amr Alkhatib,Stephanie Lowry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A conformal prediction-based approach for controlling explanation fidelity in feature attribution methods, identifying sufficient salient features to preserve model predictions without needing ground-truth explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature attribution methods vary in robustness and may not faithfully reflect black-box model reasoning, requiring better fidelity control in explanations.

Method: Proposes four conformity functions to quantify explanation fidelity, identifies sufficient salient features to preserve predictions regardless of excluded features, without needing ground-truth explanations for calibration.

Result: FastSHAP consistently outperforms competing methods in fidelity and informational efficiency (explanation region size), with super-pixel conformity measures more effective than pixel-wise ones.

Conclusion: The conformal prediction approach enables direct control over explanation fidelity and provides more reliable feature attribution explanations across diverse image datasets.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

*Muxin Pu,Mei Kuan Lim,Chun Yong Chong,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sigma is a unified skeleton-based sign language understanding framework that addresses semantic grounding, local-global balance, and cross-modal learning challenges through sign-aware early fusion, hierarchical alignment, and unified pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current skeleton-based SLU methods face three key limitations: weak semantic grounding (struggling to relate motion patterns to linguistic meaning), imbalance between local details and global context, and inefficient cross-modal learning for constructing semantically aligned representations.

Method: Proposes Sigma framework with: 1) sign-aware early fusion for deep visual-textual interaction, 2) hierarchical alignment learning to maximize agreements across different feature levels, and 3) unified pre-training combining contrastive learning, text matching, and language modeling.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art results on isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and gloss-free sign language translation across multiple benchmarks spanning different sign and spoken languages.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of semantically informative pre-training and shows skeletal data can serve as a stand-alone solution for SLU, overcoming previous limitations in semantic understanding and cross-modal alignment.

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how well automated metrics for text-image generation align with human judgments across different compositional challenges, finding that no single metric performs consistently and performance varies by task type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics for text-image generation are often adopted by convention rather than validated against human judgment, yet these metrics directly influence reported progress in the field, making it critical to understand their alignment with human preferences.

Method: The authors conduct a broad study examining widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation, analyzing their behavior across diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families (VQA-based, embedding-based, image-only) align with human judgments.

Result: No single metric performs consistently across tasks - performance varies with compositional problem type. VQA-based metrics are not uniformly superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific cases. Image-only metrics contribute little to compositional evaluation as they focus on perceptual quality rather than alignment.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of careful and transparent metric selection for trustworthy evaluation and their use as reward models in generation, highlighting that metric performance is task-dependent rather than universally applicable.

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlideMamba integrates Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks using entropy-based adaptive fusion to enhance Whole Slide Image analysis, achieving superior performance in predicting gene fusion/mutation status compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a generalizable deep learning framework that captures both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies in Whole Slide Images for improved computational pathology analysis.

Method: Combines Mamba modules for long-range global dependencies with GNNs for fine-grained short-range spatial interactions, using an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism for adaptive fusion of complementary signals.

Result: Achieved PRAUC of 0.751 ± 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491), Trans-MIL (0.39), Mamba-only (0.664), GNN-only (0.748), and GAT-Mamba (0.703), with competitive ROC AUC (0.738), sensitivity (0.662), and specificity (0.725).

Conclusion: The integrated Mamba-GNN architecture with adaptive fusion strategy demonstrates strong performance for spatially-resolved predictive modeling in computational pathology, showing promising potential for clinical applications.

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hunyuan3D-Omni is a unified framework for fine-grained, controllable 3D asset generation that accepts multiple conditioning signals beyond just images/text, enabling precise control over geometry, topology, and pose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D generative models rely primarily on image/text conditioning and lack fine-grained cross-modal controls, limiting controllability and practical adoption in production workflows.

Method: Built on Hunyuan3D 2.1, the model accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose priors as conditioning signals using a single cross-modal architecture. It employs progressive, difficulty-aware sampling that biases toward harder signals while downweighting easier ones.

Result: Experiments show the additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production workflows.

Conclusion: The unified multi-modal framework provides fine-grained control over 3D asset generation, addressing limitations of current methods and enabling more practical adoption in creative industries.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

TL;DR: A framework using vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention maps via natural language prompts, which guides CNNs to make more reliable decisions without manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs often exploit superficial correlations rather than learning meaningful features, and existing methods require labor-intensive expert annotations which limit scalability.

Method: Leverage vision-language models to generate semantic attention maps automatically using natural language prompts, then introduce an auxiliary loss to align CNN attention with these language-guided maps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST, showing improved generalization and reduced shortcut reliance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making in CNNs without requiring manual annotation, making it scalable and effective.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

Conclusion: Decipher-MR establishes a scalable and versatile foundation for MRI-based AI, enabling efficient development across clinical and research domains with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized
natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due
to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present
Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a
large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies
spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR
integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation
across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with
minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that
enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen

diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction,

*Seyed Amir Kasaei,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new framework for defining and evaluating hallucination in text-to-image (T2I) generative models, introducing a taxonomy with three categories of bias-driven deviations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of T2I models focus mainly on alignment with prompts but overlook what models generate beyond the prompt, failing to address bias-driven hallucinations that haven't been clearly framed in this domain.

Method: The authors propose defining hallucination in T2I models as bias-driven deviations and introduce a taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.

Result: This framing establishes an upper bound for evaluation and reveals hidden biases in T2I models, providing a foundation for more comprehensive assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed taxonomy and framework enable richer evaluation of T2I models by systematically addressing bias-driven hallucinations that go beyond simple prompt alignment checks.

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

TL;DR: SQ-InstructBLIP improves vision-language reasoning by generating image-aware sub-questions and answers through a three-component architecture (Questioner, Answerer, Reasoner) to overcome limitations of black-box LLMs in multi-step reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based approaches struggle with multi-step reasoning in vision-language tasks due to inability to access fine-grained visual content and the black-box nature of LLMs, which makes them inaccessible and difficult to reproduce.

Method: Proposes SQ-InstructBLIP with three components sharing the same architecture: Questioner generates sub-questions, Answerer generates sub-answers, and Reasoner performs final reasoning using the generated sub-question information for VQA tasks.

Result: Experiments show that SQ-InstructBLIP performs more accurate reasoning than previous works by using generated sub-questions as additional information when solving VQA tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of black-box LLMs by enabling image-aware iterative sub-question generation, leading to improved performance in multi-step vision-language reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

TL;DR: A framework for micro-action recognition that addresses inter-person variability using distributionally robust optimization with temporal-frequency alignment and group-invariant regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing micro-action recognition methods fail in real-world scenarios due to inter-person variability causing the same action to manifest differently, which hinders robust generalization.

Method: Proposes Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework with two components: Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module (temporal branch with Wasserstein-regularized alignment and frequency branch with variance-guided perturbations) and Group-Invariant Regularized Loss (partitions samples into pseudo-groups and up-weights boundary cases).

Result: Experiments on MA-52 dataset show the framework outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under fine-grained conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses inter-person variability in micro-action recognition through person-agnostic representations and distributionally robust optimization principles.

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

*Songlin Yang,Tianyi Wei,Yushi Lan,Zeqi Xiao,Anyi Rao,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach for semantic matching that addresses geometric ambiguity and nearest-neighbor rule limitations by adapting VGGT's 3D geometric foundation model features for cross-instance semantic matching under data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic matching methods suffer from geometric ambiguity (failing to disambiguate symmetric structures using 2D features) and nearest-neighbor rule limitations (ignoring cross-image invisibility and manifold preservation), requiring geometry-aware descriptors and holistic matching mechanisms.

Method: The approach adapts VGGT by: (i) retaining early feature stages while fine-tuning later ones and adding a semantic head for bidirectional correspondences; (ii) employing cycle-consistent training, synthetic data augmentation, and progressive training with aliasing artifact mitigation to handle data scarcity.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach achieves superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation, outperforming previous baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses key limitations in semantic matching by leveraging VGGT's geometric foundation while adapting it for cross-instance scenarios, demonstrating improved performance in geometry-aware pixel-level correspondence.

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVSR is a novel video super-resolution framework specifically designed for medical videos that addresses challenges like camera shake, noise, and abrupt frame transitions through Cross State-Space Propagation for alignment and Inner State-Space Reconstruction for artifact reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution medical videos are crucial for accurate diagnosis but hard to acquire due to hardware limitations. Current VSR models struggle with medical video challenges including camera shake, noise, abrupt frame transitions, and produce artifacts that can mislead doctors.

Method: Proposes MedVSR with two key components: Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) for precise alignment by projecting distant frames as control matrices, and Inner State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) for enhancing tissue structures through joint long-range spatial feature learning and large-kernel short-range information aggregation.

Result: Experiments across four medical datasets (including endoscopy and cataract surgeries) show MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in both reconstruction performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: MedVSR provides an effective solution for medical video super-resolution, addressing the unique challenges of medical imaging while maintaining structural accuracy crucial for clinical diagnosis.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

*Sicong Leng,Jing Wang,Jiaxi Li,Hao Zhang,Zhiqiang Hu,Boqiang Zhang,Yuming Jiang,Hang Zhang,Xin Li,Lidong Bing,Deli Zhao,Wei Lu,Yu Rong,Aixin Sun,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in multimodal reasoning models by proposing Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS) to stabilize RL fine-tuning, releasing large-scale curated datasets, and open-sourcing multimodal reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large multimodal reasoning models face two major constraints: lack of open, high-quality long chain-of-thought data and instability of RL algorithms in post-training due to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low.

Method: Proposes Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS) guided by Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory diversity. Also releases ~1.6M long CoT data and ~15k RL QA pairs with a reproducible training codebase.

Result: Experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness of both curated data and VAS. Theoretically establishes that reward variance lower-bounds expected policy gradient magnitude.

Conclusion: The proposed VAS effectively stabilizes policy optimization, and the released resources provide standardized baselines for the multimodal reasoning community.

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

### [83] [Does FLUX Already Know How to Perform Physically Plausible Image Composition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21278)
*Shilin Lu,Zhuming Lian,Zihan Zhou,Shaocong Zhang,Chen Zhao,Adams Wai-Kin Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHINE is a training-free framework for high-fidelity image composition that addresses complex lighting challenges and high-resolution inputs using pretrained diffusion models without requiring latent inversion or attention surgery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image composition models struggle with complex lighting conditions (accurate shadows, water reflections) and diverse high-resolution inputs. While modern diffusion models encode essential physical and resolution priors, they lack a framework to utilize these capabilities effectively without problematic techniques like latent inversion.

Method: SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss using pretrained customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject representation while preserving background integrity. It also employs degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending to eliminate low-quality outputs and visible seams.

Result: Experiments on ComplexCompo (a new benchmark with diverse resolutions and challenging conditions) and DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).

Conclusion: SHINE provides an effective training-free solution for high-quality image composition that handles complex lighting and high-resolution scenarios better than existing methods, with publicly available code and benchmark.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: A new foundation model using Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer architecture pre-trained on Sentinel-3 OLCI data shows promise for marine monitoring tasks, particularly for chlorophyll concentration quantification and ocean primary production estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models pre-trained on massive unlabelled datasets can overcome the challenge of sparse and expensive labelled data in ocean science, potentially revolutionizing AI applications in marine monitoring.

Method: Developed a foundation model using Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer architecture pre-trained to reconstruct Sentinel-3 OLCI data, then fine-tuned on two downstream tasks: chlorophyll concentration quantification and ocean primary production estimation.

Result: The model demonstrates utility for marine monitoring, effectively using small amounts of high-quality labelled data and capturing detailed spatial patterns of ocean color while matching point observations.

Conclusion: This new generation of geospatial AI models has potential to provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role in global climate processes.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To democratize access to advanced generative AI by making high-quality image generation computationally feasible on accessible consumer devices like mobile phones and desktop computers.

Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder
restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid
generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware

*Weilun Feng,Haotong Qin,Mingqiang Wu,Chuanguang Yang,Yuqi Li,Xiangqi Li,Zhulin An,Libo Huang,Yulun Zhang,Michele Magno,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantVGGT is a novel quantization framework for Visual Geometry Grounded Transformers (VGGTs) that addresses unique challenges in compressing billion-scale 3D reconstruction models through dual-smoothed fine-grained quantization and noise-filtered diverse sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models like VGGTs face prohibitive computational and memory costs that hinder real-world deployment. Standard Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) struggles with VGGTs due to heavy-tailed activation distributions from data-independent special tokens and unstable calibration from multi-view 3D data.

Method: QuantVGGT uses two key techniques: 1) Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained Quantization with pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local channel smoothing to handle heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel variance; 2) Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling that filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse calibration clusters for stable quantization ranges.

Result: QuantVGGT achieves state-of-the-art results across different benchmarks and bit-widths, significantly outperforming previous generic quantization methods. The 4-bit version provides 3.7× memory reduction and 2.5× acceleration while maintaining reconstruction accuracy above 98% of full-precision performance.

Conclusion: QuantVGGT demonstrates significant advantages for deploying resource-intensive 3D reconstruction models in constrained scenarios, offering substantial efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in

TL;DR: NewtonGen integrates data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles to address physical inconsistency in text-to-video generation, using Neural Newtonian Dynamics for physically consistent motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models produce unrealistic motions and lack parameter control due to learning motion distributions solely from appearance without understanding underlying dynamics.

Method: Proposes NewtonGen framework with trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND) that models Newtonian motions and injects latent dynamical constraints into video generation.

Result: Enables physically consistent video synthesis with precise parameter control by jointly leveraging data priors and dynamical guidance.

Conclusion: NewtonGen addresses fundamental limitations of current models by incorporating physical principles, providing a solution for physically consistent and controllable text-to-video generation.

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

### [88] [Interpreting Public Sentiment in Diplomacy Events: A Counterfactual Analysis Framework Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20367)
*Leyi Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework that modifies diplomatic event narratives to shift public sentiment from negative to neutral/positive using language models and counterfactual generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public sentiment is crucial for diplomacy but traditional sentiment analysis methods are slow and lack predictive capabilities. There's a need for data-driven tools to help diplomats frame events more favorably.

Method: 1) Train language model on diplomatic event descriptions and public discussions dataset 2) Identify predetermined textual features for modification based on communication theories and expert input 3) Develop counterfactual generation algorithm using LLM to systematically modify narratives while preserving core facts

Result: The framework achieved a 70% success rate in shifting public sentiment to more favorable states.

Conclusion: This provides a practical tool for diplomats and policymakers to frame diplomatic initiatives in ways that foster desirable public sentiment through data-driven insights.

Abstract: Diplomatic events consistently prompt widespread public discussion and
debate. Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good
sentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve
international issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional
methods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual
content analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
lack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework
that identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift
public sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a
language model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this
end, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and
their associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories
and in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual
features for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's
narrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual
generation algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically
produce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this
framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with
a 70\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for
diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven
insights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a
more desirable public sentiment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition is challenging due to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles across languages, requiring better alignment of emotion externalization across diverse conditions.

Method: Builds emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture shared speaker traits, then applies dual-space anchoring in speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.

Result: Evaluations on MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin) corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines.

Conclusion: The framework provides valuable insights into commonalities in cross-lingual emotion representation and effectively addresses cross-lingual SER challenges.

Abstract: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due
to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles
across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions
requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across
different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a
speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional
expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds
emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture
shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in
speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.
Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin)
corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and
provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion
representation.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates machine learning approaches for detecting ChatGPT-3.5 generated research abstracts, finding that DistilBERT performs best and ensemble methods don't outperform single transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of LLMs like ChatGPT blurs human-AI text boundaries, raising concerns about academic integrity and misinformation, necessitating reliable AI-text detection methods.

Method: Tested classical (Logistic Regression with BoW, POS, TF-IDF) and transformer-based (BERT variants, LSTM) ML techniques on 250 pairs of human-written and ChatGPT-generated research abstracts across diverse topics.

Result: DistilBERT achieved the best performance overall. Logistic Regression and BERT-Custom offered solid alternatives, while LSTM and BERT-N-gram approaches performed poorly. Ensemble methods failed to surpass DistilBERT's performance.

Conclusion: Single transformer-based models like DistilBERT outperform ensemble approaches, highlighting the importance of robust transformer frameworks with larger datasets to keep pace with advancing generative AI.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
blurred the line between human and AI-generated texts, raising urgent questions
about academic integrity, intellectual property, and the spread of
misinformation. Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment
to safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication.
In this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches
can distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing
a labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research
topics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with
classical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT
augmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier,
and LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each
model's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to
test whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector.
Results show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic
Regression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and
BERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models
fails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single
transformer-based representation over mere model diversity. By comprehensively
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these AI-text detection approaches,
this work lays a foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger,
richer datasets to keep pace with ever-improving generative AI models.

Motivation: SAE features don't inherently align with human concepts, making LLM interpretability research cumbersome and labor-intensive.

Method: ConceptViz implements a novel pipeline: query SAEs using concepts of interest, interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate correspondences through model behavior verification.

Result: The system enhances interpretability research by streamlining discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations, helping researchers build better mental models of LLM features.

Conclusion: ConceptViz effectively bridges the gap between technical SAE features and human-understandable concepts, demonstrated through usage scenarios and user study.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of natural language tasks. Understanding how LLMs internally
represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting
interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with

present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts
in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification => Interpretation =>
Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest,
interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the
correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our

*Tomoaki Isoda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SKILL-RAG is a novel method that uses reinforcement learning to leverage LLMs' self-knowledge for filtering irrelevant retrieved documents in RAG systems, improving generation quality while reducing input documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval systems in RAG may return irrelevant content leading to hallucinations. Understanding what the model "knows" and "doesn't know" (self-knowledge) is crucial for better integrating internal and external knowledge.

Method: Proposes SKILL-RAG using reinforcement learning to elicit self-knowledge from models, employing sentence-level granularity to filter irrelevant content while preserving useful knowledge.

Result: Evaluated on Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on question answering benchmarks, showing improved generation quality and significant reduction in input documents.

Conclusion: Validates the importance of self-knowledge in guiding selection of high-quality retrievals for RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks in
recent years. However, since retrieval systems may return irrelevant content,
incorporating such information into the model often leads to hallucinations.
Thus, identifying and filtering out unhelpful retrieved content is a key
challenge for improving RAG performance.To better integrate the internal
knowledge of the model with external knowledge from retrieval, it is essential
to understand what the model "knows" and "does not know" (which is also called
"self-knowledge"). Based on this insight, we propose SKILL-RAG (Self-Knowledge
Induced Learning and Filtering for RAG), a novel method that leverages the
model's self-knowledge to determine which retrieved documents are beneficial
for answering a given query. We design a reinforcement learning-based training
framework to explicitly elicit self-knowledge from the model and employs
sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving
useful knowledge.We evaluate SKILL-RAG using Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on several
question answering benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SKILL-RAG
not only improves generation quality but also significantly reduces the number
of input documents, validating the importance of self-knowledge in guiding the
selection of high-quality retrievals.

*Sirui Wang,Andong Chen,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emo-FiLM is a fine-grained emotion modeling framework for LLM-based TTS that enables word-level emotion control by aligning frame-level emotion features to words and modulating text embeddings through FiLM layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing E-TTS systems rely on sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural language prompts, which fail to capture dynamic emotional shifts within a sentence.

Method: Aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, then maps them through a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer to modulate text embeddings for word-level emotion control.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks, demonstrating effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

Conclusion: Emo-FiLM successfully addresses the limitation of capturing dynamic emotional shifts within sentences and provides superior fine-grained emotion control in text-to-speech synthesis.

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and
trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on
sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural
language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these
approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this
limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework
for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to
words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion
control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we
construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed
annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM
outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

TL;DR: USB-Rec is an integrated training-inference framework that improves LLMs for conversational recommendation through preference optimization dataset construction and self-enhancement strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based conversational recommender systems focus on leveraging LLMs' summarization and analysis capabilities but ignore training aspects, limiting their performance potential.

Method: Proposes USB-Rec framework with: 1) LLM-based Preference Optimization dataset construction for RL training, 2) Self-Enhancement Strategy at inference stage to enhance conversational recommendation capabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments on various datasets show the method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The integrated training-inference approach effectively improves LLM performance in conversational recommendation by addressing both training and inference optimization.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model
approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are
mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis
capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this
work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework,
User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs
in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a
LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL
training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in
conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy
(SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational
recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Conformal Importance Summarization is a framework that provides rigorous coverage guarantees for automatic summarization using conformal prediction to ensure critical content inclusion in high-stakes domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based summarization systems lack reliable guarantees for including critical content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance, creating deployment risks.

Method: Uses conformal prediction to calibrate thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, enabling extractive summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical content. The method is model-agnostic and requires only a small calibration set.

Result: Experiments on established summarization benchmarks show that the framework achieves theoretically assured information coverage rates.

Conclusion: The framework can be combined with existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization, enabling safer AI deployment in critical applications.

Abstract: Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language
models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical
content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work,
we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for
importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to
provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating
thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document
summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical
content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set,
and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on
established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance
Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our
work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with
existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization,
paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical
applications. Code is available at

*Xiao Wang,Jia Wang,Yijie Wang,Pengtao Dang,Sha Cao,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MARS is a role-based multi-agent framework that improves LLM reasoning efficiency by simulating a review process, reducing token usage and inference time by 50% while maintaining accuracy comparable to Multi-Agent Debate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) improves LLM reasoning but introduces substantial computational overhead due to frequent agent interactions. There's a need for more efficient collaborative reasoning frameworks.

Method: MARS uses a review-inspired process: an author agent generates initial solution, reviewer agents provide independent feedback, and a meta-reviewer integrates feedback for final decision and revision guidance.

Result: MARS matches MAD's accuracy while reducing token usage and inference time by approximately 50% across multiple benchmarks with different LLMs.

Conclusion: MARS provides an efficient alternative to MAD by eliminating costly reviewer-to-reviewer interactions while maintaining reasoning quality, making multi-agent collaboration more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural
language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when
operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to
address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple
models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces
substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the
frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent
Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review
process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer
agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer
integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.
This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly
reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and
inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art
reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with
different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both
token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in machine translation, progress remains limited for low-resource languages like Cantonese and Wu Chinese that lack large-scale training data and linguistic resources, despite having over 80 million speakers each.

Method: The authors built on existing parallel corpora to create SiniticMTError, implementing a rigorous annotation process by native speakers with analyses on inter-annotator agreement, iterative feedback, and error patterns.

Result: The dataset provides comprehensive error annotations (span, type, severity) for machine-translated examples across three Sinitic languages, serving as a resource for error detection, quality estimation, and low-resource language evaluation.

Conclusion: SiniticMTError enables fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities and supports research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and evaluation of low-resource languages.

Abstract: Despite major advances in machine translation (MT) in recent years, progress
remains limited for many low-resource languages that lack large-scale training
data and linguistic resources. Cantonese and Wu Chinese are two Sinitic
examples, although each enjoys more than 80 million speakers around the world.
In this paper, we introduce SiniticMTError, a novel dataset that builds on
existing parallel corpora to provide error span, error type, and error severity
annotations in machine-translated examples from English to Mandarin, Cantonese,
and Wu Chinese. Our dataset serves as a resource for the MT community to
utilize in fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities, supporting
research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and
low-resource language evaluation. We report our rigorous annotation process by
native speakers, with analyses on inter-annotator agreement, iterative
feedback, and patterns in error type and severity.

*Ayan Sar,Pranav Singh Puri,Sumit Aich,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SwasthLLM is a unified multilingual framework for medical diagnosis that achieves high accuracy in zero-shot cross-lingual settings without language-specific fine-tuning, using XLM-RoBERTa with language-aware attention and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of disease diagnosis in multilingual healthcare environments where annotated medical data is scarce in low-resource languages and linguistic variability exists across populations.

Method: Leverages XLM-RoBERTa encoder with language-aware attention, Siamese contrastive learning for cross-lingual semantic alignment, translation consistency module, and Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for rapid adaptation. Uses multi-task learning combining disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive learning objectives.

Result: Achieves 97.22% accuracy and 97.17% F1-score in supervised settings. In zero-shot scenarios: 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and 73.33% on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in low-resource contexts.

Conclusion: SwasthLLM provides an effective solution for multilingual medical diagnosis with strong zero-shot performance, enabling practical deployment in diverse healthcare settings without requiring language-specific training data.

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from
clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated
medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across
populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot,
cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that
operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring
language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the
multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention
mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract
medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align
semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning
module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different
languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module
and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation
learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly
optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive
learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen
languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes
robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a
test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings.
Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and
73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in
low-resource contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DS-MoE introduces depth-specialized mixture of experts that dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains based on input complexity, achieving computational savings and improved reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional transformers apply identical processing depth to all inputs, creating inefficiencies for simple queries and limiting reasoning quality for complex problems.

Method: Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE) with expert modules optimized for distinct reasoning depths and a learned routing network that dynamically activates necessary experts.

Result: 16% computational savings, 35% faster inference, and 2.8% higher accuracy on complex reasoning benchmarks compared to uniform-depth transformers.

Conclusion: DS-MoE establishes depth-specialized modular processing as an advancement that simultaneously improves efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in language models.

Abstract: Contemporary transformer architectures apply identical processing depth to
all inputs, creating inefficiencies and limiting reasoning quality. Simple
factual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex
logical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To
overcome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through
Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends
the Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised
computation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning
depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical
inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned
routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only
the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we
trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse
domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web
content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental
results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational
savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth
transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex
multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield
interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability. These
findings establish DS-MoE as a significant advancement in adaptive neural
architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialised modular processing can
simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in
large-scale language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HRT is a hierarchical transformer that processes language at multiple resolutions using wavelet-inspired architecture, achieving better performance and efficiency than standard transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard transformers misrepresent language hierarchy by processing text as flat token sequences, leading to quadratic complexity, weak compositional generalization, and poor discourse modeling.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT) with multi-resolution attention that enables bottom-up composition and top-down contextualization, using exponential sequence reduction for O(nlogn) complexity.

Result: HRT outperforms transformers by +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, +6.1% on Long Range Arena, with 42% memory reduction and 37% latency improvement compared to BERT/GPT models.

Conclusion: HRT aligns computational structure with language hierarchy, demonstrating that multi-scale processing yields both theoretical efficiency gains and practical language understanding improvements.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
natural language tasks, yet they fundamentally misrepresent the hierarchical
nature of human language by processing text as flat token sequences. This
results in quadratic computational cost, weak computational cost, weak
compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling. We
propose Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel wavelet-inspired
neural architecture that processes language simultaneously across multiple
resolutions, from characters to discourse-level units. HRT constructs a
multi-resolution attention, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down
contextualization. By employing exponential sequence reduction across scales,
HRT achieves O(nlogn) complexity, offering significant efficiency improvements
over standard transformers. We evaluated HRT on a diverse suite of benchmarks,
including GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena, and WikiText-103, and results
demonstrated that HRT outperforms standard transformer baselines by an average
of +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, and +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while
reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to BERT and
GPT style models of similar parameter count. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of cross-resolution attention and scale-specialized modules,
showing that each contributes independently to both efficiency and accuracy.
Our findings establish HRT as the first architecture to align computational
structure with the hierarchical organization of human language, demonstrating
that multi-scale, wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical
efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FS-DFM is a discrete flow-matching model that enables high-quality language generation with only 8 sampling steps, achieving 128x faster sampling than traditional 1,024-step methods while maintaining perplexity parity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models are serial and slow for long sequences, while standard diffusion models require hundreds to thousands of evaluations. There's a need for faster parallel generation without sacrificing quality.

Method: Introduces Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching with explicit step parameterization, consistent training across step budgets, reliable update rules to prevent overshooting, and strong teacher guidance distilled from long trajectories.

Result: FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity parity with 1,024-step discrete-flow baselines on language modeling benchmarks, delivering 128x faster sampling for 1,024-token generation.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges the gap between serial autoregressive models and iterative diffusion models, providing fast, high-quality parallel language generation with controllable step budgets.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are
inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits
throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language
generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to
thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for
iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A
discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.
The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit
parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big
move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update
rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and
with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,
these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On
language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity
parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens
using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and
corresponding latency/throughput gains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRECOG, a method for forecasting language model performance from redacted task descriptions without running experiments, showing moderate prediction accuracy with well-calibrated uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the evaluation bottleneck in large language model development by enabling performance forecasting before conducting actual experiments.

Method: Curated PRECOG corpus of redacted description-performance pairs, used retrieval-equipped models to predict scores from task descriptions and configurations without dataset access.

Result: Achieved mean absolute error as low as 8.7 on Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds; stronger models showed diverse iterative querying while open-source models lagged.

Conclusion: The approach offers initial steps toward anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and smarter experiment prioritization in language model development.

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck:
build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask
a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We
study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a
redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset
instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted
description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics.
Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a
retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction
performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as
low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis
indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying,
whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather
evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting,
forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are
indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial
prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step
toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and
smarter experiment prioritization.

TL;DR: This paper presents methods for building Japanese speech recognizers that output phonemic labels with accent markers, addressing data sparsity through multitask training and fusion techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Japanese is resource-rich but lacks sufficient data for training models to produce accurate phonemic transcriptions with accent marks, which are crucial for speaking assessment tasks.

Method: Two methods: (1) multitask training with auxiliary loss functions for orthographic text and pitch patterns, (2) fusion of phonetic alphabet and text token estimators using finite-state transducer framework.

Result: The proposed methods reduced average mora-label error rates from 12.3% to 7.1% on CSJ core evaluation sets, showing effectiveness over generic multilingual recognizers.

Conclusion: Multitask learning and fusion techniques are effective for building accurate Japanese phonemic recognizers, with demonstrated advantages over existing approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for
Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer
that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is
resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to
produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose
two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme
introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and
pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic
annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one
over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To
combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state
transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning
and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show
that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual
recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also
compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates
from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework that integrates knowledge from LLMs with structural features from pre-trained molecular models to enhance molecular property prediction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While GNNs and self-supervised learning have advanced molecular property prediction, human prior knowledge remains essential. LLMs can extract knowledge but suffer from gaps and hallucinations, especially for less-studied properties.

Method: Proposes a framework that prompts LLMs to generate domain knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, then fuses these knowledge-based features with structural representations from pre-trained models. Uses GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-R1 for knowledge extraction.

Result: Extensive experiments show the integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that combining LLM-derived knowledge with structural information provides a robust solution.

Conclusion: The combination of LLM-extracted knowledge and structural features creates an effective framework for molecular property prediction, addressing limitations of both pure structure-based and knowledge-based approaches.

Abstract: Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance
on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning
approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration
of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods
that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite
their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations,
particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from
LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to
enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant
knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing
knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural
representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and
DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the
combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a
robust and effective solution for MPP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RedHerring is a novel attack that makes attack detection models unreliable by modifying text to trigger false attack predictions while maintaining correct classifier outputs, creating tension between classifier and detector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the reliability of attack detection models in NLP systems, which haven't been thoroughly explored despite their importance in providing security checks and human intervention signals.

Method: Proposed RedHerring attack that modifies text to cause detection models to predict attacks while keeping the classifier correct, tested on 4 datasets against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers.

Result: RedHerring successfully drops detection accuracy by 20-71 points while maintaining or improving classifier accuracy. A simple confidence check defense significantly improves detection accuracy without retraining.

Conclusion: This novel threat model reveals vulnerabilities in attack detection systems and provides new insights into how adversaries can target detection models, highlighting the need for more robust defense mechanisms.

Abstract: In response to adversarial text attacks, attack detection models have been
proposed and shown to successfully identify text modified by adversaries.
Attack detection models can be leveraged to provide an additional check for NLP
models and give signals for human input. However, the reliability of these
models has not yet been thoroughly explored. Thus, we propose and test a novel
attack setting and attack, RedHerring. RedHerring aims to make attack detection
models unreliable by modifying a text to cause the detection model to predict
an attack, while keeping the classifier correct. This creates a tension between
the classifier and detector. If a human sees that the detector is giving an
``incorrect'' prediction, but the classifier a correct one, then the human will
see the detector as unreliable. We test this novel threat model on 4 datasets
against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers. We find that RedHerring is able to
drop detection accuracy between 20 - 71 points, while maintaining (or
improving) classifier accuracy. As an initial defense, we propose a simple
confidence check which requires no retraining of the classifier or detector and
increases detection accuracy greatly. This novel threat model offers new
insights into how adversaries may target detection models.

*Abhinay Shankar Belde,Rohit Ramkumar,Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes two new attack selection strategies (Hybrid and Dynamic Select) that combine BinarySelect and GreedySelect to reduce query costs for adversarial text attacks on NLP models while maintaining effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational cost and inefficiency of existing black-box attack methods on transformer-based NLP models, especially for researchers with limited GPU resources.

Method: Hybrid Select uses a size threshold to decide between BinarySelect and GreedySelect, while Dynamic Select learns which selection method to apply based on text length. Both combine strengths of previous algorithms.

Result: Reduces queries per attack by up to 25.82% on average across 4 datasets and 6 target models (encoder models and LLMs) without losing attack effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly improve efficiency of adversarial text attacks, making them more practical for resource-constrained researchers while maintaining robustness evaluation capabilities.

Abstract: Adversarial text attack research plays a crucial role in evaluating the
robustness of NLP models. However, the increasing complexity of
transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost
of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g.,
GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number
of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To
address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called
Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous
selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques
with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection
algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining
the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each
selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of
queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of
BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best
method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required
queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs,
without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

*Hsiao-Ying Huang,Yi-Cheng Lin,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MI-Fuse is a denoised label fusion framework that adapts student models to outperform large audio-language models (LALMs) in cross-domain speech emotion recognition (SER) using only unlabeled target-domain audio and API-only LALM access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world SER deployments often fail under domain mismatch where source data is unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through APIs. The goal is to adapt student models to outperform LALMs in target domains without sharing source data.

Method: MI-Fuse supplements LALMs with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. It draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher.

Result: Experiments across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.9%.

Conclusion: This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation to domain mismatch scenarios.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech
tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in
real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are
unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask:
given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student
model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we
propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM
with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The
framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights
their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and
stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments
across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show
consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the
strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech
systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.

### [110] [Probability Distribution Collapse: A Critical Bottleneck to Compact Unsupervised Neural Grammar Induction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20734)
*Jinwook Park,Kangil Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses probability distribution collapse in unsupervised neural grammar induction, proposing a collapse-relaxing neural parameterization that improves parsing performance with more compact grammars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised neural grammar induction models suffer from expressiveness bottlenecks, leading to unnecessarily large yet underperforming grammars due to probability distribution collapse.

Method: The authors analyze when and how probability distribution collapse emerges in neural parameterization components and introduce a targeted solution called collapse-relaxing neural parameterization to mitigate this issue.

Result: The proposed approach substantially improves parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive empirical analysis.

Conclusion: The collapse-relaxing neural parameterization effectively addresses the core limitation of probability distribution collapse in neural grammar induction, leading to better performance with more compact grammars.

Abstract: Unsupervised neural grammar induction aims to learn interpretable
hierarchical structures from language data. However, existing models face an
expressiveness bottleneck, often resulting in unnecessarily large yet
underperforming grammars. We identify a core issue, $\textit{probability
distribution collapse}$, as the underlying cause of this limitation. We analyze
when and how the collapse emerges across key components of neural
parameterization and introduce a targeted solution, $\textit{collapse-relaxing
neural parameterization}$, to mitigate it. Our approach substantially improves
parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact
grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive
empirical analysis.

*Youwon Jang,Woo Suk Choi,Minjoon Jung,Minsu Lee,Byoung-Tak Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C2R is a training-free framework that improves question-answering performance across text, image, and video domains by strategically constructing and refining sub-questions and answers to derive better confidence scores for final answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance QA model performance without requiring additional training, by leveraging the model's own confidence scores through systematic sub-question reasoning paths.

Method: C2R curates subsets of sub-QAs to explore diverse reasoning paths, compares confidence scores of answer candidates, and selects the most reliable final answer based solely on the model's internal confidence metrics.

Result: The framework demonstrates consistent performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks, and can be seamlessly integrated with various existing QA models.

Conclusion: C2R provides valuable insights into how sub-QA quantity and quality affect model reasoning reliability, offering a practical training-free approach for robust QA performance across multiple domains.

Abstract: We propose Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a novel
training-free framework applicable to question-answering (QA) tasks across
text, image, and video domains. C2R strategically constructs and refines
sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score
for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse
reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer
candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on
confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly
integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we
provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs
affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity
and quality of sub-QAs on achieving robust and reliable reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SFT on domain-specific data doesn't always hurt general capabilities - using smaller learning rates helps, and Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting (TALR) outperforms other methods in balancing domain adaptation with general capability preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the common belief that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific data necessarily degrades LLMs' general capabilities, and to find effective strategies to mitigate this trade-off.

Method: Empirical evaluation of various strategies (small learning rates, L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW) and proposing Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting (TALR), supported by theoretical analysis.

Result: Smaller learning rates substantially mitigate general performance degradation while preserving target-domain performance. TALR consistently outperforms baselines in balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities.

Conclusion: Practical guidelines: (i) use small learning rates for favorable trade-off, (ii) adopt TALR when stronger balance is needed. No method completely eliminates the trade-off, but TALR provides the best balance.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach
to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often
believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this
trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show
that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially
mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable
target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains
these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss
Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning
rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all
cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss,
including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed
TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely
eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in
balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill
our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i)
using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a
stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

*Chenhui Hu,Pengfei Cao,Yubo Chen,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Atoms Theory, defining atoms as fundamental units of LLM internal representations, addressing limitations of neurons and features. It introduces atomic inner product for representation shifting correction, proves RIP conditions, and validates through SAE experiments showing atoms better capture intrinsic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current undefined fundamental units (neurons/features) in LLMs limit understanding of mechanisms. Neurons suffer from polysemy while features face unreliable reconstruction and instability issues.

Method: Propose Atoms Theory with atomic inner product (AIP) to correct representation shifting. Prove RIP conditions for stable sparse representations. Train threshold-activated sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B models.

Result: Achieved 99.9% sparse reconstruction across layers, with >99.8% atoms satisfying uniqueness condition (vs 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features). Scaling experiments show link between SAE size and recovery capacity.

Conclusion: Atoms Theory provides systematic framework for understanding LLM internal representations, offering theoretical foundation for mechanistic interpretability with validated superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models
(LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms.
Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from
polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and
instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines
such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct
representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that
atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse
representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger
conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$
recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that
single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably
identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated
SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse
reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy
the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features,
showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs.
Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery
capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms
Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal
representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability. Code

### [114] [Few-Shot and Training-Free Review Generation via Conversational Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20805)
*Genki Kusano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Conversational Prompting methods (SCP and CCP) for few-shot personalized review generation using LLMs without additional training, showing significant improvements over conventional prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the real-world challenge of few-shot and training-free personalized review generation, where traditional methods require extensive user review histories or model fine-tuning.

Method: Reformulates user reviews as multi-turn conversations: SCP uses only the target user's reviews, while CCP adds contrastive examples from other users/LLMs as incorrect replies to encourage user-specific style.

Result: Experiments across 8 domains and 5 LLMs showed conversational prompting produces reviews much closer to target user's style compared to conventional prompts, even with only 2 reviews per user.

Conclusion: Conversational prompting provides a practical solution for few-shot, training-free personalized review generation, with SCP being competitive when negative examples are unavailable and CCP offering further improvements with quality contrastive data.

Abstract: Personalized review generation helps businesses understand user preferences,
yet most existing approaches assume extensive review histories of the target
user or require additional model training. Real-world applications often face
few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are
available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language
models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness
depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational
Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn
conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP),
relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant,
Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or
LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging
the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product
domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt
often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on
text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented
tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP
and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when
each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when
high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive
when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational
prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and
training-free constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Enrich-on-Graph (EoG) framework uses LLMs to enrich knowledge graphs, bridging the semantic gap between structured KGs and unstructured queries for improved KGQA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in KGQA due to semantic gaps between structured knowledge graphs and unstructured queries, which existing methods overlook.

Method: Proposes EoG framework that leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, enabling efficient evidence extraction and precise reasoning while maintaining low computational costs and scalability.

Result: Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets show EoG effectively generates high-quality KGs and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: EoG successfully bridges the semantic gap in KGQA tasks, providing a flexible, scalable solution with theoretical validation and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in complex
tasks. However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in
knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA).
We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs)
and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and
structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable
workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this
challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which
leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between
graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for
precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs,
scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose
three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA
task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives.
Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can
effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance. Our code and data are available at

### [116] [Leveraging What's Overfixed: Post-Correction via LLM Grammatical Error Overcorrection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20811)
*Taehee Park,Heejin Do,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PoCO is a novel approach that combines LLMs' overcorrection tendency with sLMs' precision to improve grammatical error correction by first maximizing recall via LLM overcorrection, then refining outputs with targeted post-correction using smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Language Models (sLMs) have high precision but low recall in grammatical error correction, while Large Language Models (LLMs) have high recall but low precision due to overcorrection. The goal is to leverage both strengths to achieve balanced performance.

Method: PoCO first uses LLMs to intentionally trigger overcorrection to maximize recall, then applies a post-correction step using fine-tuned smaller models to identify and refine erroneous outputs from the LLM.

Result: Extensive experiments show that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall while maintaining competitive precision, improving overall grammatical error correction quality.

Conclusion: PoCO successfully harmonizes the generative power of LLMs with the reliability of smaller supervised models, achieving a strategic balance between recall and precision in grammatical error correction.

Abstract: Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high
reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost
of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite
tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To
effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in
sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach
that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally
triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive
revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller
models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both
aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the
reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with
competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical
error correction.

TL;DR: Cheat-sheet ICL distills many-shot in-context learning into concise summaries, achieving comparable performance with far fewer tokens and no test-time retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of many-shot in-context learning in large language models, which requires processing long input tokens.

Method: Proposes cheat-sheet ICL that distills information from many-shot examples into a concise textual summary (cheat sheet) used as context during inference.

Result: Achieves comparable or better performance than many-shot ICL with significantly fewer tokens, and matches retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval.

Conclusion: Cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs in downstream tasks, offering efficiency gains while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context
learning (ICL) with many-shot examples, but at the cost of high computational
demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL,
which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual
summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on
challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or
better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches
retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings
demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs
in downstream tasks.

TL;DR: A zero-shot tree-search-based iterative sentence rewriting algorithm for privacy-preserving text anonymization that outperforms existing methods by balancing privacy protection with text utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in LLM-based cloud services where user inputs may expose sensitive information, overcoming limitations of existing anonymization techniques that struggle with text naturalness and utility preservation.

Method: Proposes a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private information through structured search guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of rewriting space while preserving coherence and naturalness.

Result: Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show the approach significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior balance between privacy protection and utility preservation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses privacy concerns in LLM applications by providing a robust solution that maintains text quality while protecting sensitive information.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in cloud-based
services has raised significant privacy concerns, as user inputs may
inadvertently expose sensitive information. Existing text anonymization and
de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often
struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In
this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence
rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private
information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method
incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search
guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space.
Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly
outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy
protection and utility preservation.

*Guo Chen,Qiuyuan Li,Qiuxian Li,Hongliang Dai,Xiang Chen,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes generating sub-sentence citations in RAG systems to improve verifiability and reduce user effort in confirming LLM outputs, addressing issues with existing sentence/paragraph-level citations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attribution methods produce citations at sentence or paragraph level, which may include irrelevant content or omit essential verification information, forcing users to read surrounding context.

Method: Developed annotation guidelines for sub-sentence citations, constructed a dataset, and proposed an attribution framework using LLMs to generate fine-tuning data with a credit model to filter low-quality examples.

Result: Experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach can generate high-quality and more readable citations.

Conclusion: Sub-sentence citations provide more concise and sufficient attribution, reducing user effort in verifying LLM-generated outputs while maintaining verifiability.

Abstract: In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems,
generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances
verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we
observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods.
First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph
level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of
irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that
is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding
context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are
both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to
confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop
annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset.
Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere
to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate
fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out
low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate
that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable
citations.

TL;DR: WeFT is a weighted supervised fine-tuning method for diffusion language models that assigns different weights to tokens based on their entropy, achieving significant improvements over standard SFT on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show strong potential in language modeling with faster generation than autoregressive approaches, but applying SFT is challenging due to lack of precise probability estimates at each denoising step and inconsistent generation processes.

Method: Proposed WeFT method that assigns different weights to tokens based on their entropy derived from diffusion theory, allowing better control over key tokens that guide generation direction.

Result: Achieved relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard SFT on Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and MATH-500 benchmarks when trained on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from open-r1.

Conclusion: WeFT effectively addresses the SFT challenges in diffusion language models and delivers substantial performance gains on reasoning tasks, with code and models to be made publicly available.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling,
offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches.
However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains
challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step.
While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire
sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often
inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that
guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a
weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned
different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT
delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from
open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard
SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and
MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions, proposing and evaluating both prompting and fine-tuning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision-making relies on considering multiple options rather than single answers to reduce risks of narrow perspectives, but current medical reasoning models are typically trained to produce only one answer even in open-ended settings.

Method: The study investigates two approaches: prompting and fine-tuning (supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning). It proposes new reward functions for ranked-list formats and conducts ablation studies for reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: Results show that while some supervised fine-tuning models generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with reinforcement fine-tuning are more robust across multiple formats. Models can recognize valid answers even when they fail to select the benchmark's preferred ground truth.

Conclusion: This work provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains, with reinforcement fine-tuning showing superior robustness for ranked-list generation.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models
(MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical
decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple
options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are
typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We
propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:
prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an
MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:
choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train
and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT
incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We
propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and
conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models
generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust
across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with
multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the
benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches
for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work
provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are
beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

TL;DR: SummQ is a novel adversarial multi-agent framework for long document summarization that uses collaborative intelligence between summarization and quizzing agents to address information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with long document summarization due to information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence problems when processing excessively long documents.

Method: Adversarial multi-agent framework with summary generators/reviewers and quiz generators/reviewers working collaboratively. An examinee agent validates if summaries contain information needed to answer quiz questions, enabling iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks across ROUGE, BERTScore, LLM-as-a-Judge, and human evaluations.

Conclusion: Establishes a new approach for long document summarization using adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality through multi-agent dynamics and quizzing mechanisms.

Abstract: Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large
language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with
information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing
excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent
framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence
between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains:
summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and
reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive
summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions
that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This
adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the
generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions,
enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We
evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well
as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal
the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of
different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This
work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses
adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

### [123] [MemLens: Uncovering Memorization in LLMs with Activation Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20909)
*Zirui He,Haiyan Zhao,Ali Payani,Mengnan du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemLens is a novel method that detects memorization in LLMs by analyzing probability trajectories of numeric tokens during generation, revealing that contaminated samples show early confidence locking while clean samples exhibit gradual evidence accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods for LLM contamination rely on surface-level features like lexical overlap and perplexity, which have low generalization and perform poorly on implicitly contaminated data.

Method: The proposed MemLens analyzes probability trajectories of numeric tokens during generation, identifying 'shortcut' behaviors where contaminated samples lock onto answers early in model layers, while clean samples show gradual reasoning across all layers.

Result: Contaminated and clean samples exhibit distinct, well-separated reasoning trajectories. Validation through LoRA fine-tuning with carefully designed samples shows the same trajectory patterns as naturally contaminated data.

Conclusion: MemLens captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations, providing a more effective approach for detecting contamination in LLM evaluations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks
such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of
being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on
surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization
and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In
this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection)
to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric
tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit
``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the
model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence
accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and
clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To
further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model
through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in
naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens
captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

*Krishna Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load is better explained by linear proximity between words or by structural density of intervening material, proposing Intervener Complexity as a refined measure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality in sentence comprehension by testing whether structural factors (number of intervening heads) offer explanatory power beyond linear distance measures.

Method: Used harmonized dependency treebanks and mixed-effects modeling across multiple languages to evaluate sentence length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of memory load, operationalized as the sum of feature misbinding and interference.

Result: All three factors were positively associated with memory load, with sentence length having the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity providing explanatory power beyond linear distance.

Conclusion: The findings reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives by treating dependency length as a surface signature while identifying intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration demands, demonstrating how graph measures and cross-linguistic modeling can disentangle linear and structural contributions to processing efficiency.

Abstract: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is
better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by
the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based
accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the
work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a
head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear
distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects
framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence
length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the
Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the
contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during
processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the
linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability;
current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine
additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with
sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity
offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings
reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating
dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying
intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance
demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures
and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and
structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path
for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

### [125] [Tool Calling for Arabic LLMs: Data Strategies and Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20957)
*Asim Ersoy,Enes Altinisik,Husrev Taha Sencar,Kareem Darwish*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates tool calling capabilities for Arabic language LLMs, addressing three key questions about data requirements, instruction tuning effects, and fine-tuning strategies for Arabic tool calling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tool calling research is predominantly English-centric, creating a gap for other languages like Arabic. The paper aims to understand how to enable tool calling functionality for Arabic LLMs.

Method: The researchers conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. They bridge the resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets into Arabic to study three research questions.

Result: The study provides findings on the necessity of in-language tool-calling data versus cross-lingual transfer, the effect of general-purpose instruction tuning, and the value of fine-tuning on specific high-priority tools.

Conclusion: The research offers crucial insights into optimal strategies for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic, addressing the language gap in tool calling capabilities.

Abstract: Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their
utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly
English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this
functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates
three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic)
tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of
general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the
value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these
questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained
variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the
resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets
into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies
for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

*Valeria Ramirez-Garcia,David de-Fitero-Dominguez,Antonio Garcia-Cabot,Eva Garcia-Lopez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic Text-Input Problems using rubrics, finding that Reference Aided Evaluation performs best compared to human evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs can be used as automatic evaluation systems for academic Text-Input Problems in education, building on existing research about LLMs as evaluators and educational tools.

Method: Proposed five evaluation systems tested on a custom dataset of 110 computer science answers from higher education students using three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The systems include JudgeLM evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation, No Reference Evaluation, Additive Evaluation, and Adaptive Evaluation.

Result: Reference Aided Evaluation showed the best performance with the lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and root mean square deviation (1.214) compared to human evaluation. Other methods had limitations in handling concise answers or lacked necessary information for proper assessment.

Conclusion: AI-driven automatic evaluation systems, when aided with proper methodologies like Reference Aided Evaluation, show potential as complementary tools to academic resources, offering fair scoring and insightful evaluations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods
like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education,
LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our
research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic
Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have
been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from
higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM
evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;
Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from
the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the
reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive
Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each
question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human
evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and
score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the
lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square
deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation
offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other
methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results
in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to
correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good
results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that
Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper
methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic
resources.

TL;DR: Large language models can accelerate text analysis for FFRDCs using few-shot learning with secure open-source framework OnPrem.LLM, demonstrated on defense policy and scientific documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FFRDCs face text-heavy workloads that are slow to analyze manually, requiring efficient tools for summarization, classification, extraction, and sense-making in sensitive government contexts.

Method: Apply OnPrem.LLM open-source framework for secure generative AI using few-shot learning (only a few input-output examples) to analyze defense policy documents (NDAA) and scientific corpora (NSF Awards).

Result: The approach enhances oversight and strategic analysis capabilities while maintaining auditability and data sovereignty for sensitive government applications.

Conclusion: Large language models with secure frameworks like OnPrem.LLM provide effective solutions for accelerating text analysis in sensitive FFRDC environments while addressing security and sovereignty concerns.

Abstract: Federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) face text-heavy
workloads, from policy documents to scientific and engineering papers, that are
slow to analyze manually. We show how large language models can accelerate
summarization, classification, extraction, and sense-making with only a few
input-output examples. To enable use in sensitive government contexts, we apply
OnPrem$.$LLM, an open-source framework for secure and flexible application of
generative AI. Case studies on defense policy documents and scientific corpora,
including the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and National Science
Foundation (NSF) Awards, demonstrate how this approach enhances oversight and
strategic analysis while maintaining auditability and data sovereignty.

### [128] [Behind RoPE: How Does Causal Mask Encode Positional Information?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21042)
*Junu Kim,Xiao Liu,Zhenghao Lin,Lei Ji,Yeyun Gong,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The causal mask in Transformer decoders provides positional information independently of explicit encodings like RoPE, inducing position-dependent attention patterns that favor nearby tokens and distorting RoPE's relative patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and prove that the causal mask itself, separate from explicit positional encodings, serves as a significant source of positional information in Transformer decoders.

Method: Theoretical analysis of causal mask-induced attention patterns and empirical validation through examination of trained models, focusing on the interaction between causal mask and RoPE positional encodings.

Result: Causal mask induces position-dependent attention patterns favoring nearby query-key pairs, and its interaction with RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention patterns into non-relative ones, observed consistently in modern large language models.

Conclusion: The causal mask should be considered as an important source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings, as it fundamentally shapes attention patterns in Transformer decoders.

Abstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of
positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides
positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce
position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or
causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the
induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the
behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that
trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further
amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal
mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into
non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large
language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a
source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

### [129] [When Instructions Multiply: Measuring and Estimating LLM Capabilities of Multiple Instructions Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21051)
*Keno Harada,Yudai Yamazaki,Masachika Taniguchi,Edison Marrese-Taylor,Takeshi Kojima,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces two benchmarks (ManyIFEval and StyleMBPP) to evaluate LLMs' ability to follow multiple instructions simultaneously, showing performance degrades with more instructions, and develops regression models that can predict performance on unseen instruction combinations with ~10% error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in real-world scenarios, understanding their ability to follow multiple instructions simultaneously becomes crucial for practical applications.

Method: Created two specialized benchmarks: ManyIFEval for text generation (up to 10 instructions) and StyleMBPP for code generation (up to 6 instructions). Developed three regression models to estimate performance on unseen instruction combinations, with logistic regression using instruction count as the key variable.

Result: Experiments across ten LLMs show consistent performance degradation as instruction count increases. The logistic regression model can predict performance with approximately 10% error, even for unseen combinations. Modest sample sizes (500 for ManyIFEval, 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for accurate estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmarks and regression models enable efficient evaluation of LLMs' multi-instruction following capabilities, providing practical tools for assessing real-world performance without exhaustive testing of all possible instruction combinations.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world
scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple
instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we
introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple
instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval
(ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware
Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to
six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs
reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions
increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible
combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual
use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate
performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of
instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic
regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict
performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error,
even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample
sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance
estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction
combinations.

*Qixin Wan,Zilong Wang,Jingwen Zhou,Wanting Wang,Ziheng Geng,Jiachen Liu,Ran Cao,Minghui Cheng,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SoM-1K is the first large-scale multimodal benchmark for evaluating foundation models on strength of materials problems, showing current models struggle with engineering tasks (best accuracy 56.6%) and that text descriptions outperform visual inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models have shown strong capabilities in various domains, but their performance on complex multimodal engineering problems remains largely unexplored, particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

Method: Created SoM-1K dataset with 1,065 annotated strength of materials problems containing both text and diagrams. Proposed Descriptions of Images (DoI) prompting strategy using expert-generated text descriptions. Evaluated 8 foundation models including LLMs and VLMs.

Result: Current foundation models struggle significantly with engineering problems, with best performance at 56.6% accuracy. LLMs with DoI often outperform VLMs with visual diagrams. DoI effectively mitigates visual misinterpretation errors.

Conclusion: This work establishes a rigorous engineering AI benchmark and highlights the need for developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models, especially for scientific and engineering applications.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but
their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely
unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark
dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength
of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems,
mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem
statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current
foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a
novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides
rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the
context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both
large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results
show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these
engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%
accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often
outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis
reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation
errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective
than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a
rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for
developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,
particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

### [131] [Which Cultural Lens Do Models Adopt? On Cultural Positioning Bias and Agentic Mitigation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21080)
*Yixin Wan,Xingrun Chen,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit culture positioning bias, favoring mainstream US culture over others. The paper introduces CultureLens benchmark and proposes agent-based mitigation methods that effectively reduce this bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs risk perpetuating subtle fairness issues by positioning their generations from mainstream US cultural perspectives while treating non-mainstream cultures as outsiders, creating a novel culture positioning bias.

Method: Proposed CultureLens benchmark with 4000 prompts across 10 cultures for interview script generation. Developed two mitigation methods: FIP (prompt-based) and MFA framework with single-agent (self-reflection) and multi-agent (planner-critic-refiner hierarchy) pipelines.

Result: Evaluation of 5 SOTA LLMs showed models adopt insider tones in 88% of US contexts but outsider stances for less dominant cultures. Agent-based mitigation methods (especially MFA-MA) effectively reduced cultural bias.

Conclusion: Agent-based methods represent a promising direction for mitigating cultural biases in generative LLMs, with structured multi-agent frameworks showing particular effectiveness in producing culturally unbiased content.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream
generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating
subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the
perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient
externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and
systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an
LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other
cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000
generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through
the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an
LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10
diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a
stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of
US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider
stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2
inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness
Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness
Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)
introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.
(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized
agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates
initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates
feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase
the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for
mitigating biases in generative LLMs.

*Mohammad Hosseini,Kimia Hosseini,Shayan Bali,Zahra Zanjani,Saeedeh Momtazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PerHalluEval is the first Persian-language benchmark for evaluating LLM hallucinations, using a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline with human validation to detect extrinsic and intrinsic hallucinations in QA and summarization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination is a persistent issue in LLMs, particularly affecting low-resource languages like Persian, which lack dedicated evaluation benchmarks.

Method: A three-stage LLM-driven pipeline augmented with human validation, using log probabilities to select believable hallucinated instances, and human annotation for Persian-specific cultural contexts in QA tasks.

Result: Evaluation of 12 LLMs showed models struggle with detecting Persian hallucinations; external knowledge (original documents) partially mitigates hallucination; no significant difference between Persian-specialized LLMs and others.

Conclusion: PerHalluEval addresses the gap in Persian hallucination evaluation, revealing LLMs' limitations in handling Persian text and suggesting external knowledge as a partial solution, while highlighting the need for better Persian-specific model training.

Abstract: Hallucination is a persistent issue affecting all large language Models
(LLMs), particularly within low-resource languages such as Persian.
PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our
benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human
validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and
summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to
select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged
human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in
order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian
culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models
using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting
hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e.,
the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination
partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of
hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.

*Hyunseo Kim,Sangam Lee,Kwangwook Seo,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BESPOKE is a realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in search-augmented LLMs, addressing the gap in systematic evaluation of personalized information-seeking systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current search-augmented LLMs lack systematic evaluation for personalization, despite user needs requiring recognition of different intents across users and delivery of information in preferred forms.

Method: The benchmark is constructed through long-term human annotation where contributors provide their own chat/search histories, author queries with detailed information needs, and evaluate responses with fine-grained preference scores and diagnostic feedback.

Result: BESPOKE enables systematic analyses that reveal key requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks.

Conclusion: BESPOKE provides a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized search-augmented LLMs, with code and data made publicly available.

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) have advanced
information-seeking tasks by integrating retrieval into generation, reducing
users' cognitive burden compared to traditional search systems. Yet they remain
insufficient for fully addressing diverse user needs, which requires
recognizing how the same query can reflect different intents across users and
delivering information in preferred forms. While recent systems such as ChatGPT
and Gemini attempt personalization by leveraging user histories, systematic
evaluation of such personalization is under-explored. To address this gap, we
propose BESPOKE, the realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in
search-augmented LLMs. BESPOKE is designed to be both realistic, by collecting
authentic chat and search histories directly from humans, and diagnostic, by
pairing responses with fine-grained preference scores and feedback. The
benchmark is constructed through long-term, deeply engaged human annotation,
where human annotators contributed their own histories, authored queries with
detailed information needs, and evaluated responses with scores and diagnostic
feedback. Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key
requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks,
providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized
search-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at

### [134] [VoiceBBQ: Investigating Effect of Content and Acoustics in Social Bias of Spoken Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21108)
*Junhyuk Choi,Ro-hoon Oh,Jihwan Seol,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoiceBBQ is a spoken extension of the BBQ bias benchmark that evaluates social bias in Spoken Language Models (SLMs) from both content and acoustic aspects using controlled voice conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To measure social bias in SLMs that can emerge from both content (textual) and acoustic (voice characteristics) aspects, which traditional text-based benchmarks cannot capture.

Method: Converted every BBQ context into controlled voice conditions to enable comparable bias measurements. Evaluated two SLMs (LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio) using per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores.

Result: LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias but amplifies gender and accent bias, while Qwen2-Audio dampens these cues while preserving content fidelity.

Conclusion: VoiceBBQ provides a compact testbed for jointly diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models, revealing architectural contrasts in bias handling.

Abstract: We introduce VoiceBBQ, a spoken extension of the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for
Question Answering) - a dataset that measures social bias by presenting
ambiguous or disambiguated contexts followed by questions that may elicit
stereotypical responses. Due to the nature of speech, social bias in Spoken
Language Models (SLMs) can emerge from two distinct sources: 1) content aspect
and 2) acoustic aspect. The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled
voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that
remain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate
two SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts:
LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias,
whereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content
fidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly
diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.

### [135] [Acoustic-based Gender Differentiation in Speech-aware Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21125)
*Junhyuk Choi,Jihwan Seol,Nayeon Kim,Chanhee Cho,EunBin Cho,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpeechLMs exhibit paradoxical gender bias patterns - showing male-oriented responses in gender-stereotypical questions but gender-independent responses in gender-dependent questions where differentiation would be appropriate, primarily due to Whisper speech encoders generating male-oriented acoustic tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze acoustic-based gender differentiation in SpeechLMs where identical questions lead to different responses based on speaker's gender, despite these models prioritizing general fairness principles.

Method: Created a new dataset of 9,208 speech samples across three categories (Gender-Independent, Gender-Stereotypical, Gender-Dependent) and evaluated LLaMA-Omni series models, testing with neutral options and gender neutralization methods, comparing SpeechLMs with backbone LLMs.

Result: Models consistently exhibited male-oriented responses in Gender-Stereotypical questions but gender-independent responses in Gender-Dependent questions. The pattern persists with neutral options and gender neutralization, primarily stemming from Whisper speech encoders generating male-oriented acoustic tokens.

Conclusion: Current SpeechLMs fail to properly utilize gender information, prioritizing general fairness over contextual appropriateness, revealing the need for more sophisticated techniques to handle gender information in speech technology.

Abstract: Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed
human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may
exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to
different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new
dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208
speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent,
Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni
series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems
identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.
Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently
exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions
where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models
exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this
pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.
When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in
Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied
gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs
with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns
primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented
acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not
successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness
principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more
sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech
technology.

### [137] [Retrieval over Classification: Integrating Relation Semantics for Multimodal Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21151)
*Lei Hei,Tingjing Liao,Yingxin Pei,Yiyang Qi,Jiaqi Wang,Ruiting Li,Feiliang Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ROC reformulates multimodal relation extraction as a retrieval task using natural language relation descriptions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved robustness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multimodal relation extraction methods use classification-based paradigms with fused features, which overlook structural constraints like entity types/positions and lack semantic expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding.

Method: ROC integrates entity type and positional information through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language descriptions using LLMs, and aligns entity-relation pairs via semantic similarity-based contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNRE and MORE benchmark datasets, demonstrating stronger robustness and interpretability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Retrieval-based approach with natural language relation descriptions effectively addresses limitations of classification-based paradigms in multimodal relation extraction.

Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities
in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal
scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with
fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This
paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural
constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic
expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose
\underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a
novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by
relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information
through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language
descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via
semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and

### [138] [Learning the Wrong Lessons: Syntactic-Domain Spurious Correlations in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21155)
*Chantal Shaib,Vinith M. Suriyakumar,Levent Sagun,Byron C. Wallace,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how LLMs develop spurious correlations between syntactic templates and domains, which can override semantic understanding and lead to performance issues and safety vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs must understand both semantics and domain to correctly respond to instructions, but syntax can convey implicit information. The authors aim to characterize how syntactic-domain correlations affect model behavior and identify potential safety risks.

Method: The authors use a synthetic training dataset to study syntactic-domain correlations in OLMo-2 models, develop an evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models (including OLMo-2-7B, Llama-4-Maverick, and GPT-4o), and conduct a case study on safety finetuning implications.

Result: Syntactic-domain correlations lower performance on entity knowledge tasks (mean 0.51 +/- 0.06) in OLMo-2 models. The phenomenon occurs in both open and closed models, and can be exploited to bypass safety refusals in OLMo-2-7B Instruct and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need to explicitly test for syntactic-domain correlations and ensure syntactic diversity in training data within domains to prevent spurious correlations that can compromise model performance and safety.

Abstract: For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the
semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.
However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that
syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are
prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we
characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction
pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain,
where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can
sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we
find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/-
0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an
evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that
it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B;
Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study
on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended
syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B
Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test
for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in
training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious
correlations.

*Tyler Loakman,William Thorne,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper surveys computational humor in NLP, focusing on humor generation and explanation, and discusses future research directions considering humor's subjective and ethical nature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reasoning abilities of large language models through humor understanding and generation, as humor requires extensive common-sense knowledge and creative reasoning.

Method: Conducts a literature survey of computational humor research, particularly examining generative tasks of humor creation and explanation beyond just puns.

Result: Despite humor understanding being a foundational NLP task, research on generating and explaining humor remains limited, and current models still fall short of human capabilities.

Conclusion: Computational humor processing is an important NLP subdiscipline that needs more research, with future directions needing to account for humor's subjective nature and ethical considerations.

Abstract: The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait,
positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging
tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and
frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to
understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the
common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models
(LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it
pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that,
despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a
foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns
remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human
capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of
computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an
extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes
into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

### [140] [GEP: A GCG-Based method for extracting personally identifiable information from chatbots built on small language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21192)
*Jieli Zhu,Vi Ngoc-Nha Tran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates personally identifiable information (PII) leakage in small language models (SLMs) and proposes GEP, a greedy coordinate gradient-based method for effective PII extraction, showing significant improvement over template-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models (SLMs) offer comparable performance to large language models with less resource consumption, but their PII leakage risks in downstream tasks remain unexplored, particularly for chatbot applications.

Method: The authors fine-tune ChatBioGPT based on BioGPT using medical datasets, then develop GEP - a greedy coordinate gradient-based method specifically designed for PII extraction in SLMs, testing it against template-based methods and in free-style insertion scenarios.

Result: GEP demonstrates up to 60× more PII leakage compared to template-based methods, and maintains a 4.53% leakage rate even in complex free-style insertion scenarios with various syntactic expressions.

Conclusion: SLMs are vulnerable to PII leakage, and the proposed GEP method effectively extracts PII where traditional template-based methods fail, highlighting the need for better privacy protection in SLM deployments.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their
approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs)
in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and
inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of
SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate
the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot,
i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca
and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared
with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove
that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively
extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition.
We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method
specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of
GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared
with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of
GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting
free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of
various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able
to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified framework combining implicit retrieval and structured collaboration that achieves state-of-the-art performance on scientific reasoning tasks while significantly reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two major bottlenecks in LLM scientific reasoning: explicit retrieval's 'tool tax' of extra tokens/steps, and multi-agent pipelines diluting strong solutions through averaging.

Method: Monitor-based retrieval module at token level for implicit knowledge integration, plus Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) and Quality-Aware Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) for structured collaboration.

Result: Achieves 48.3% accuracy on HLE Bio/Chem Gold (highest reported), surpassing strongest baseline by 13.4 points, while reducing token usage by 53.5% and agent steps by 43.7%. Robust across SuperGPQA and TRQA.

Conclusion: Implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Error analysis shows reasoning failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in 85%+ cases, with retrieval tasks benefiting from diversity and reasoning tasks favoring consensus.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on
scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit
retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden "tool tax" of extra tokens and
steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging
across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework
that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its
foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,
integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of
this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates
each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware
Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's
Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the
highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4
points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously
reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA
and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning
failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity
analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution
variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings
demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the
inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Code is available

### [142] [CLaw: Benchmarking Chinese Legal Knowledge in Large Language Models - A Fine-grained Corpus and Reasoning Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21208)
*Xinzhe Xu,Liang Zhao,Hongshen Xu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLaw is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Chinese legal knowledge and reasoning, consisting of a comprehensive statute corpus and case-based reasoning tasks, revealing significant deficiencies in LLMs' ability to accurately reproduce legal provisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used for legal text analysis but their reliability is compromised by general pre-training that lacks specialized legal focus, obscuring their true legal knowledge depth.

Method: Introduces CLaw benchmark with two components: (1) comprehensive corpus of 306 Chinese national statutes segmented to subparagraph level with historical revisions (64,849 entries), and (2) 254 case-based reasoning instances from China Supreme Court materials.

Result: Most contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal provisions, which critically undermines their reliability for legal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Trustworthy legal reasoning in LLMs requires robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval (enhanced via SFT or RAG) and strong general reasoning capabilities. CLaw provides essential benchmark for advancing domain-specific LLM reasoning in legal sphere.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal
texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised
by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus,
obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw,
a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on
Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two
key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese
national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating
precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849
entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances
derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical
application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most
contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal
provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the
basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability
of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in
LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially
enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an
essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM
reasoning, particularly within the complex legal sphere.

*Yaxiong Wu,Yongyue Zhang,Sheng Liang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SGMem (Sentence Graph Memory) is a novel memory management approach for long-term conversational AI that uses sentence-level graphs to organize dialogue across different granularities, improving context retrieval and response generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory methods based on fact extraction or summarization struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across different granularities of dialogue, limiting their effectiveness for long-term conversational agents.

Method: SGMem represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and session-level contexts. It combines retrieved raw dialogue with generated memory (summaries, facts, insights) to provide coherent context for LLMs.

Result: Experiments on LongMemEval and LoCoMo benchmarks show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

Conclusion: SGMem effectively addresses the memory management challenges in long-term conversational AI by providing a structured approach to organize and retrieve dialogue information across multiple granularities.

Abstract: Long-term conversational agents require effective memory management to handle
dialogue histories that exceed the context window of large language models
(LLMs). Existing methods based on fact extraction or summarization reduce
redundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across
different granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem
(Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs
within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and
session-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated
memory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent
and relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and
LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong
baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

TL;DR: QCG-RAG is a query-centric graph RAG framework that solves the granularity dilemma in graph-based retrieval by enabling query-granular indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based RAG methods face a granularity dilemma: fine-grained entity-level graphs have high token costs and lose context, while coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations needed for multi-hop reasoning.

Method: Uses Doc2Query and Doc2Query-- to construct query-centric graphs with controllable granularity, then employs a tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism to select relevant chunks via generated queries.

Result: Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG datasets show QCG-RAG consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in question answering accuracy.

Conclusion: QCG-RAG establishes a new paradigm for multi-hop reasoning by improving graph quality and interpretability through query-centric indexing and retrieval.

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language
models (LLMs) with external knowledge for long-context understanding and
multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma:
fine-grained entity-level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while
coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce
QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular
indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages
Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to construct query-centric graphs with
controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A
tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then selects relevant chunks via the
generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG
consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in
question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop
reasoning.

### [145] [Un-Doubling Diffusion: LLM-guided Disambiguation of Homonym Duplication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21262)
*Evgeny Kaskov,Elizaveta Petrova,Petr Surovtsev,Anna Kostikova,Ilya Mistiurin,Alexander Kapitanov,Alexander Nagaev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses homonym duplication in diffusion models, where words with identical spelling but different meanings cause models to generate multiple senses simultaneously. The issue is exacerbated by Anglocentric bias in translation pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Homonyms create challenges for generative models, particularly when combined with Anglocentric bias that introduces additional translation steps, causing even non-homonymous words in original languages to become problematic after English translation.

Method: The authors introduce a method for measuring duplication rates and evaluate different diffusion models using both automatic evaluation with Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human evaluation. They also investigate prompt expansion as a mitigation technique.

Result: The study demonstrates that prompt expansion effectively reduces homonym duplication and also helps mitigate issues related to Anglocentric bias in text-to-image generation pipelines.

Conclusion: The paper provides both measurement techniques and mitigation strategies for homonym duplication in diffusion models, with the automatic evaluation pipeline code made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose
challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt,
diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which
is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an
Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the
text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous
in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after
translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring
duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using
both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human
evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym
duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach
also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for
the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

### [146] [LLM Output Homogenization is Task Dependent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21267)
*Shomik Jain,Jack Lanchantin,Maximilian Nickel,Karen Ullrich,Ashia Wilson,Jamelle Watson-Daniels*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses output homogenization in LLMs by proposing a task-dependent approach to evaluate and mitigate it through task-anchored functional diversity and sampling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to output homogenization fail to account for task-specific diversity requirements, where homogenization may be desirable in some tasks (like math) but problematic in others (like creative writing).

Method: The authors developed a task taxonomy with eight categories, introduced task-anchored functional diversity metrics, and proposed a task-anchored sampling technique to increase diversity where needed while maintaining quality.

Result: The approach successfully increases functional diversity for tasks where homogenization is undesired while preserving it where desired, challenging the diversity-quality trade-off assumption.

Conclusion: Task-dependent evaluation and mitigation strategies significantly improve how output homogenization is addressed in LLMs, providing more nuanced and effective solutions.

Abstract: A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response
homogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and
whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.
For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the
final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,
for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components
(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity
produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output
homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.
We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following
contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task
categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.
(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output
homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that
increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is
undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We
challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by
increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we
demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of
output homogenization.

TL;DR: LLMTrace is a new bilingual corpus for AI-generated text detection that addresses limitations in existing datasets by providing character-level annotations for mixed human-AI authorship detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI text detection datasets are outdated, predominantly English-only, and lack character-level annotations needed for precise localization of AI-generated segments in mixed authorship scenarios.

Method: Constructed a large-scale bilingual (English and Russian) corpus using diverse modern proprietary and open-source LLMs, with character-level annotations to support both full-text binary classification and AI-generated interval detection.

Result: Created LLMTrace dataset that enables training and evaluation of more nuanced AI detection models capable of identifying specific AI-generated segments within mixed human-AI texts.

Conclusion: LLMTrace serves as a vital resource for developing next-generation AI detection models that can handle practical scenarios of mixed authorship with precise localization capabilities.

Abstract: The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is
limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are
often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to
address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.
Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the
character-level annotations required for the precise localization of
AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce
LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for
AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern
proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key
tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel
task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level
annotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training
and evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection
models. The project page is available at

*Dingzirui Wang,Xuanliang Zhang,Keyan Xu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical analysis of how input perturbations affect Chain-of-Thought (CoT) outputs, deriving an upper bound for perturbations and proving key relationships with reasoning steps and model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research shows CoT outputs are sensitive to input perturbations, but there's no theoretical explanation of how these perturbations propagate during reasoning, limiting understanding and improvement of prompt optimization methods.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze input perturbation effects on CoT output fluctuation, derive an upper bound for acceptable perturbations, and apply these findings to Linear Self-Attention models as simplified Transformers.

Result: The analysis proves that: (i) perturbation upper bound is positively correlated with reasoning steps; (ii) infinite reasoning cannot eliminate perturbation effects; (iii) for LSA models, the bound is negatively correlated with input embedding and hidden state norms. Experimental results on three datasets and four models validate the theory.

Conclusion: The theoretical framework provides insights into perturbation propagation in CoT reasoning, with experimental validation confirming the correctness of the derived relationships, offering guidance for improving prompt optimization methods.

Abstract: Existing research indicates that the output of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is
significantly affected by input perturbations. Although many methods aim to
mitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how
these perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research.
This gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate
during the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt
optimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the
effect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first
derive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the
output fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that:
(i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning
steps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot
eliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to
the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified
version of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound
for input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input
embedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we
conduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models.
The experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically
demonstrating the correctness of our findings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DisCoCLIP improves vision-language models by explicitly encoding syntactic structure using tensor networks, achieving better compositional reasoning with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models often fail on tasks requiring understanding of word order and predicate-argument structure due to neglecting compositional language structure.

Method: Combines frozen CLIP vision transformer with novel tensor network text encoder that parses sentences using Combinatory Categorial Grammar, creating distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror grammatical derivation. Uses tensor decompositions for efficiency.

Result: Raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%, boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, achieves 93.7% on SVO-Swap benchmark with under 1M parameters.

Conclusion: Explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but
often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on
tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce
DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer
with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic
structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to
yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's
grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are
factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of
millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised
contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and
word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,
boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves
93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that
embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields
interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve
compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

TL;DR: Updesh is a large-scale synthetic instruction-following dataset for 13 Indian languages, created using a bottom-up generation strategy that grounds data in language-specific Wikipedia content, showing significant improvements in multilingual AI performance particularly for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of developing effective multilingual AI systems that remain culturally grounded, especially in low-resource settings, by exploring synthetic data generation methods beyond the dominant top-down translation approach.

Method: Bottom-up generation strategy using large open-source LLMs (>=235B parameters) to create culturally contextualized datasets grounded in language-specific Wikipedia content, producing 9.5M data points across 13 Indian languages with diverse reasoning and generative tasks.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation shows high-quality generated data with significant gains on generative tasks and competitive performance on multiple-choice NLU tasks, with most pronounced improvements in low and medium-resource languages narrowing the gap with high-resource languages.

Conclusion: Effective multilingual AI requires multi-faceted data curation strategies incorporating context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies, as demonstrated by the success of the Updesh dataset in improving performance across diverse multilingual tasks.

Abstract: Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while
remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in
low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its
effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.
We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized
datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that
prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation
in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant
top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource
languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale
synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13
Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an
emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian
cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated
metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated
data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further
improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning
models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse
multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve
significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice
style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and
medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages.
These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI
requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate
context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

*Daniel Vennemeyer,Phan Anh Duong,Tiffany Zhan,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper decomposes sycophantic behaviors in LLMs into distinct types (agreement and praise) and shows they are encoded along separate linear directions in latent space that can be independently controlled.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether sycophantic behaviors in LLMs arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes, and to decompose these behaviors for better analysis and control.

Method: Used difference-in-means directions, activation additions, and subspace geometry analysis across multiple models and datasets to examine sycophantic agreement, sycophantic praise, and genuine agreement.

Result: Found that the three behaviors are encoded along distinct linear directions, can be independently amplified or suppressed without affecting others, and show consistent representational structure across model families and scales.

Conclusion: Sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct, independently steerable representations rather than a single unified mechanism.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as
excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether
these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.
We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise,
contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions,
activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and
datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct
linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently
amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their
representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.
These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,
independently steerable representations.

TL;DR: RLBFF combines human preferences with rule-based verification to create more interpretable and versatile reward models for LLM alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF lacks interpretability and suffers from reward hacking due to subjective human judgments, while RLVR is limited to correctness-based verification. RLBFF aims to bridge this gap by combining human feedback versatility with rule-based precision.

Method: Extracts binary principles (e.g., accuracy, readability) from natural language feedback and trains reward models as entailment tasks (response satisfies/doesn't satisfy principles). Uses fully open-source recipe to align models like Qwen3-32B.

Result: Achieves top performance on RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 leaderboard). Matches/exceeds o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on MT-Bench, WildBench, Arena Hard v2 at <5% inference cost.

Conclusion: RLBFF provides interpretable, customizable reward modeling that outperforms traditional Bradley-Terry approaches while enabling users to specify principles of interest at inference time.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM
post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with
interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that
usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus
on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary
Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven
preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward
models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.
RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.
accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language
feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as
an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary
principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform
Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on
RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,
2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time
to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry
models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to
align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the
performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of
MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

### [154] [An Approach to Checking Correctness for Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20364)
*Thomas J Sheffler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent behavior that detects errors by analyzing execution traces of tool calls and state transitions, rather than relying on fragile text matching of inputs/outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current error-detection approaches for LLM-based agents rely on text matching which is fragile due to natural language variability. A more robust method is needed to verify system behavior independent of specific textual outputs.

Method: Uses temporal logic techniques from hardware verification to monitor execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions. Provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple execution scenarios.

Result: Demonstrated on a three-agent system solving multi-step reasoning tasks. When using capable models, all assertions were satisfied. When smaller models were substituted, violations occurred due to improper tool sequencing and failed coordination, which were successfully detected.

Conclusion: The approach provides effective detection of behavioral regressions in production agentic systems and offers a foundation for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability in critical applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

### [155] [LATTS: Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20368)
*Theo Uscidda,Matthew Trager,Michael Kleinman,Aditya Chattopadhyay,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LATTS is an adaptive test-time scaling method that allocates variable compute across generation steps based on local difficulty, achieving better accuracy-compute tradeoffs than uniform scaling approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing verifier-based methods increase computation uniformly across all samples and generation steps, leading to inefficient resource use without considering instance complexity.

Method: LATTS employs a verifier-based acceptance criterion at each generation step to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop generation, adjusting computational effort based on local difficulty.

Result: Empirical results show LATTS achieves significantly superior accuracy-compute tradeoffs compared to standard verifier-based methods.

Conclusion: Adaptive allocation of compute based on local difficulty at each generation step provides more efficient test-time scaling than uniform approaches.

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in TTS scheduling including message collisions, locked loops from incorrect precedence handling, and generation of incomplete/invalid schedules that compromise system safety and performance.

Method: Proposes reconstruction models with systematic transformation of scheduling priorities, robust safety checks, efficient allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms for handling unexpected context events like hardware failures and mode transitions.

Result: Comprehensive experiments across multiple performance profiles show significant enhancement in system adaptability, operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and scalable solution for safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling reliable real-time scheduling under dynamic and uncertain conditions.

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

### [159] [Adaptive Approach to Enhance Machine Learning Scheduling Algorithms During Runtime Using Reinforcement Learning in Metascheduling Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20520)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive online learning unit using Reinforcement Learning to overcome limitations of offline-trained AI scheduling in time-triggered architectures, enabling real-time adaptation to dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional offline training of AI scheduling inferences faces challenges in constructing comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graphs that account for all possible scenarios, especially complex context events like hardware failures and mode changes, which is resource-intensive and often infeasible.

Method: Integration of an adaptive online learning unit within the metascheduler using Reinforcement Learning models that continuously explore and discover new scheduling solutions, expanding the MSG and optimizing existing schedulers in real-time.

Result: The proposed approach enables dynamic adaptation to unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios, allowing the system to handle stricter deadlines and new performance criteria while maintaining flexibility and efficiency.

Conclusion: The online RL-based learning unit enhances system robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical environments by continuously refining AI inferences through real-time training, overcoming the limitations of offline training approaches.

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

*Pawel Trajdos,Marek Kurzynski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A fuzzy recognition system for EMG-based hand prosthesis control that detects contaminated biosignals using one-class classifiers and KNN ensembles to improve classification quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EMG biosignals for prosthesis control are highly susceptible to contamination, which significantly reduces classification quality and system reliability.

Method: Two-ensemble system: one-class classifiers to detect contaminated channels and KNN ensemble for intent recognition, using a coherent fuzzy model for uniform soft decision-making.

Result: Experimental evaluation using real biosignals showed the system's effectiveness in mitigating contamination effects and improving recognition quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed fuzzy recognition system successfully addresses contamination issues in EMG biosignals, enhancing the reliability of upper limb prosthesis control systems.

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents struggle with meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks.

Method: Proposes SAMULE framework with retrospective language model trained on Multi-Level Reflection Synthesis: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro), Intra-Task Learning (meso), and Inter-Task Learning (macro). Includes foresight-based reflection for interactive settings.

Result: Significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines on three challenging benchmarks: TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench.

Conclusion: Well-designed reflection synthesis and failure-centric learning are critical for building self-improving LLM agents.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

Motivation: To create an automated system for radiotherapy plan evaluation that is protocol-aware, interpretable, and minimizes hallucination while providing traceable outputs.

Method: Used a multi-protocol dataset of 614 radiotherapy plans across four disease sites with normalized dose metrics. The RAG system integrates retrieval engine optimization, percentile prediction based on cohort similarity, and clinical constraint checking directed by LLM through multi-step prompt-driven reasoning.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable

continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its
interaction and self-learning.

### [166] [Parallel Thinking, Sequential Answering: Bridging NAR and AR for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20744)
*Qihang Ai,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework combining auto-regressive and non-autoregressive models for efficient reasoning tasks, achieving 26% improvement with reduced inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR models produce coherent outputs but are slow for reasoning tasks requiring long chains of thought, while NAR models are fast but sacrifice quality. The goal is to leverage both strengths.

Method: Use NAR models to efficiently generate intermediate reasoning traces, which then guide AR models to produce precise final answers.

Result: 26% improvement over strong baselines with substantially reduced inference cost.

Conclusion: The integrated AR-NAR framework effectively balances speed and quality for reasoning-intensive tasks.

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

*Yufan Mao,Hanjing Ye,Wenlong Dong,Chengjie Zhang,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Meta-Memory is an LLM-driven agent that creates high-density environmental memory representations, enabling robots to answer spatial queries through semantic-spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need effective memory systems to store observations and answer human queries about spatial locations, but current approaches lack principled mechanisms for efficient memory retrieval and integration.

Method: Proposes Meta-Memory, which constructs environmental memory representations and performs joint reasoning over semantic and spatial modalities to retrieve and integrate relevant memories for natural language location queries.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SpaceLocQA and NaVQA benchmarks, and successfully deployed on real-world robotic platforms demonstrating practical utility.

Conclusion: Meta-Memory provides robust spatial reasoning capabilities for robots in complex environments through effective memory construction and multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

*Lipeng Ma,Yixuan Li,Weidong Yang,Mingjie Zhou,Xinyi Liu,Ben Fei,Shuhao Li,Xiaoyan Sun,Sihang Jiang,Yanghua Xiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogReasoner is a coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework that enables LLMs to perform expert-level log analysis by structuring reasoning workflows and refining analytical granularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs struggle with structured reasoning workflows and precise reasoning steps needed for expert-level log analysis tasks like anomaly detection and failure prediction.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) coarse-grained enhancement using expert troubleshooting flowcharts to structure reasoning workflows, (2) fine-grained enhancement through task-specific fine-tuning and preference learning to calibrate reasoning details from mistakes.

Result: LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs on four distinct log analysis tasks using Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities for log analysis, enabling them to reason like experts through structured workflows and refined analytical processes.

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

*Tianrun Xu,Haoda Jing,Ye Li,Yuquan Wei,Jun Feng,Guanyu Chen,Haichuan Gao,Tianren Zhang,Feng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeFacto is a counterfactual reasoning framework that improves multimodal language models by enforcing both accurate answering and faithful reasoning through three training paradigms: positive, counterfactual, and random-masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal language models often reach correct answers but rely on irrelevant image regions due to biases, indicating flawed reasoning and lack of true image understanding. This highlights the need for better reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks.

Method: Proposes DeFacto framework with three training paradigms: positive, counterfactual, and random-masking. Uses automated pipeline to localize question-relevant evidence and construct dataset variants. Trains models with GRPO-based reinforcement learning using three complementary rewards.

Result: Experiments on diverse benchmarks show DeFacto substantially improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: DeFacto successfully addresses reasoning fidelity issues in multimodal language models by jointly enforcing accurate answering and faithful reasoning through counterfactual training paradigms.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

*Heming Zhang,Di Huang,Wenyu Li,Michael Province,Yixin Chen,Philip Payne,Fuhai Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GALAX integrates GNNs with LLMs via reinforcement learning using a Graph Process Reward Model to generate disease-relevant subgraphs, addressing limitations of existing methods in precision medicine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pipelines capture only partial information: numerical omics ignore topology, text-centric LLMs lack quantitative reasoning, and graph models underuse node semantics. PRMs have unreliable intermediate evaluation and reward hacking issues.

Method: Propose GALAX framework that integrates pretrained GNNs into LLMs via reinforcement guided by GPRM. Generates disease-relevant subgraphs step-wise initiated by LLM and iteratively evaluated by pretrained GNN. Also introduce Target-QA benchmark for GNN pretraining.

Result: Enables process-level supervision without explicit intermediate reasoning annotations. Supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs).

Conclusion: Provides scalable, biologically grounded framework for explainable, reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning for reliable target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

*Najla Zuhir,Amna Mohammad Salim,Parvathy Premkumar,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an LLM-based framework for mobile app review analysis that addresses limitations of star ratings and traditional NLP methods by capturing nuanced feedback through structured prompting and RAG-QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Star ratings fail to capture nuanced feedback in detailed review texts, and traditional NLP techniques struggle with contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and linguistic features like sarcasm.

Method: Modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by structured prompting techniques, quantifying rating-text sentiment discrepancies, extracting feature-level insights, and supporting interactive exploration via retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA).

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three datasets (AWARE, Google Play, Spotify) show the LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses baseline methods with improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable insights in challenging review scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of traditional review analysis methods and provides superior performance in capturing nuanced feedback from mobile app reviews.

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AOT* is a framework that combines LLM-generated chemical synthesis pathways with AND-OR tree search to improve retrosynthesis planning efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-step retrosynthetic planning faces computational challenges due to exponential search spaces and high inference costs, despite LLMs showing chemical reasoning capabilities.

Method: AOT* integrates LLM-generated synthesis pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search, using atomic mapping of complete routes onto tree components with reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based context engineering.

Result: AOT* achieves state-of-the-art performance with 3-5× fewer iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with efficiency advantages becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables LLMs to efficiently navigate chemical space for retrosynthesis planning, demonstrating significant improvements in search efficiency while maintaining competitive solve rates.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

TL;DR: A framework using deterministic finite automata (DFAs) to evaluate AI agents' function-call sequences, with CORE metrics assessing path correctness, safety, and efficiency beyond binary final-state judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent benchmarks only evaluate final outcomes, ignoring critical aspects like safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness in function-call sequences.

Method: Propose DFA-based framework encoding tasks as valid tool-use paths, introducing CORE metrics (Path Correctness, Kendall's tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, Efficiency) for comprehensive agent evaluation.

Result: The method reveals significant performance differences between agents that appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation across diverse world models.

Conclusion: The DFA-based framework and CORE metrics provide principled assessment of agent behavior, offering more comprehensive evaluation than traditional binary final-state approaches.

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

*Miao Li,Alexander Gurung,Irina Saparina,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciTrek is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' long-context reasoning using scientific articles, featuring complex questions that require information synthesis across multiple full-text papers, with automated generation via SQL queries for scalable and verifiable evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current long-context benchmarks use non-scientific texts, focus on simple retrieval tasks, or employ artificial contexts, lacking the complexity needed to properly evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities with scientific literature.

Method: Questions and answers are automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database of article metadata. This provides explicit reasoning steps for error analysis and scales to 1M token contexts with minimal supervision.

Result: Experiments show SciTrek poses significant challenges as context length increases, with fine-tuning and reinforcement learning offering limited improvements. Models struggle with basic numerical operations and locating specific information in long contexts.

Conclusion: SciTrek reveals systematic shortcomings in LLMs' long-context reasoning capabilities, particularly in numerical operations and information localization, highlighting the need for better evaluation methods and model improvements.

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Wei Zhuo,Yue Xiu,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE is a neuro-symbolic framework that treats knowledge graph context construction as a sequential decision process, optimizing for accuracy, latency, and cost trade-offs using multi-agent reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static k-hop expansions and "think-longer" prompting methods over-retrieve context, inflate costs, and have unpredictable runtime. There's a need for systems that can balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost targets while preserving provenance.

Method: CLAUSE uses a three-agent neuro-symbolic framework with Lagrangian-Constrained Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) to coordinate Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator agents for joint optimization of subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection under resource budgets.

Result: On MetaQA-2-hop, CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower edge growth compared to GraphRAG. It delivers higher accuracy while reducing subgraph growth and latency across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG datasets.

Conclusion: CLAUSE produces compact, provenance-preserving contexts with predictable performance under deployment constraints, enabling per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost without retraining.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

*Samuel Schapiro,Sumuk Shashidhar,Alexi Gladstone,Jonah Black,Royce Moon,Dilek Hakkani-Tur,Lav R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a theoretical framework for evaluating combinatorial creativity in LLMs, focusing on novelty and utility rather than accuracy. It reveals scaling behavior patterns, optimal model configurations for creativity, and identifies a persistent novelty-utility tradeoff that limits LLMs' creative potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks don't address how LLMs generalize for creative tasks like scientific idea generation, which requires evaluating open-ended combinatorial creativity rather than fixed-target accuracy.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating creativity through novelty and utility metrics, then conducted empirical analysis of LLM scaling behavior and model architecture effects.

Result: Found optimal model depths/widths for creativity at fixed compute budgets, discovered LLMs excel at novel idea generation but struggle with practical feasibility, and identified a fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff that persists even at scale.

Conclusion: The persistent novelty-utility tradeoff casts doubt on LLMs' long-term creative potential in current form, but the framework provides foundation for understanding and improving AI creativity as a new generalization frontier.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper challenges the hypothesis that persuasive efficacy in Multi-Agent Systems is primarily a function of model scale, proposing instead that persuasion dynamics are dictated by a model's cognitive process and reasoning capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand persuasion dynamics in Multi-Agent Systems where LLMs and LRMs collaborate, challenging the prevailing scale-based hypothesis and exploring how cognitive processes influence persuasive behavior.

Method: Conducted multi-agent persuasion experiments to study persuasion duality, examining how reasoning processes affect resistance to persuasion and persuasive ability when reasoning content is shared.

Result: Found that LRMs with reasoning processes exhibit greater resistance to persuasion but become more persuasive when their reasoning content is transparent. Also revealed complex influence propagation dynamics in multi-hop persuasion networks.

Conclusion: Provides evidence linking internal processing architecture to external persuasive behavior, offering insights for the safety, robustness, and design of future Multi-Agent Systems.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recon-Act is a self-evolving multi-agent framework that improves web task execution through a reconnaissance-action paradigm, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VisualWebArena by dynamically generating and using generalized tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal agents struggle with disordered action sequencing and excessive trial-and-error when solving real-world web tasks in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories.

Method: A two-team system: Reconnaissance Team conducts comparative analysis of error vs. successful trajectories to infer remedies and generate generalized tools; Action Team handles intent decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution using these tools.

Result: Recon-Act achieves state-of-the-art performance on VisualWebArena, substantially improving adaptability to unseen websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a closed-loop training pipeline (data-tools-action-feedback) that enables self-evolution and better web task execution, currently reaching Level 3 implementation with limited human intervention.

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

*Yidong Wang,Yunze Song,Tingyuan Zhu,Xuanwang Zhang,Zhuohao Yu,Hao Chen,Chiyu Song,Qiufeng Wang,Cunxiang Wang,Zhen Wu,Xinyu Dai,Yue Zhang,Wei Ye,Shikun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TrustJudge is a probabilistic framework that addresses inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge evaluation systems through distribution-sensitive scoring and likelihood-aware aggregation, reducing Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-as-a-judge evaluation frameworks suffer from critical inconsistencies including Score-Comparison Inconsistency (where lower-rated responses outperform higher-scored ones) and Pairwise Transitivity Inconsistency (circular preference chains and equivalence contradictions), which stem from information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments.

Method: TrustJudge uses two key innovations: 1) distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from discrete rating probabilities to preserve information entropy, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity.

Result: When evaluated with Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, TrustJudge reduced Score-Comparison inconsistency from 23.32% to 14.89% (8.43% improvement) and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency from 15.22% to 4.40% (10.82% improvement), while maintaining higher evaluation accuracy across various model architectures and scales.

Conclusion: TrustJudge provides the first systematic analysis of evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment without requiring additional training or human annotations.

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

### [180] [Expanding Reasoning Potential in Foundation Model by Learning Diverse Chains of Thought Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21124)
*Xuemiao Zhang,Can Ren,Chengying Tu,Rongxiang Weng,Shuo Wang,Hongfei Yan,Jingang Wang,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to selectively use high-value chain-of-thought (CoT) data by identifying reasoning patterns that expand a model's reasoning potential, achieving significant performance improvements with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches use CoT data indiscriminately, but it's unclear which data types most effectively enhance reasoning capabilities. The authors aim to identify and utilize high-value reasoning patterns to improve model performance efficiently.

Method: The authors define reasoning potential as the inverse of attempts needed to answer correctly. They abstract atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, create a core reference set of valuable patterns, and use a dual-granularity algorithm (chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy) to select high-value CoT data (CoTP) that aligns with the core set.

Result: Using only 10B-token CoTP data, the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts model improved by 9.58% on AIME 2024/2025 and raised the upper bound of downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

Conclusion: Selective use of high-value reasoning patterns in CoT data can significantly enhance model reasoning capabilities with minimal data, providing a more efficient approach to training reasoning models.

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

*Kohsei Matsutani,Shota Takashiro,Gouki Minegishi,Takeshi Kojima,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel analysis framework to understand how reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) shape reasoning capabilities in large language models, revealing complementary effects where RL compresses incorrect reasoning paths while SFT expands correct ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To go beyond accuracy-based evaluation and understand how RL and SFT training methods qualitatively shape the reasoning process in LLMs, as current understanding remains largely elusive despite their widespread use.

Method: Developed a two-level analysis framework: trajectory-level analysis of complete reasoning outputs and step-level analysis of reasoning graphs where nodes represent individual reasoning steps. Applied this to models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains.

Result: RL compresses incorrect reasoning trajectories while SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis shows RL steepens decay rates (2.5x) of graph metrics, concentrating reasoning functionality into few steps, while SFT flattens them (reduced to one-third), homogenizing reasoning across many steps.

Conclusion: The analysis explains why the current best practice of SFT followed by RL is successful, and offers practical implications for data construction and more efficient learning approaches by revealing the complementary nature of these training methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

*Yiwen Zhang,Ziang Chen,Fanqi Kong,Yizhe Huang,Xue Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToMPO algorithm enhances LLM strategic decision-making by modeling others' strategies and game dynamics, outperforming GRPO by 35% and larger models by 18%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM decision-making approaches focus on social conversations or simulated environments but neglect strategic decision types and interdependencies. Current RL methods fail to consider others' strategies during training.

Method: Proposed ToMPO algorithm optimizes perception of others' strategies and game trends through: 1) strategy-based rollouts, 2) graph-level and sample-level advantage estimation, 3) balanced global/partial rewards.

Result: ToMPO outperforms GRPO by 35% in output compliance and cooperative outcomes, and shows 18% improvement over models 100x larger in size.

Conclusion: ToMPO effectively enhances LLM strategic decision-making capabilities by addressing strategic interdependencies and opponent modeling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

*Wentao Zhu,Zhining Zhang,Yuwei Ren,Yin Huang,Hao Xu,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified approach inspired by mirror neurons to align representations between action observation and execution tasks using contrastive learning in a shared latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning methods treat action understanding and embodied execution as separate tasks, overlooking the fundamental interplay between them that mirror neurons reveal.

Method: The approach uses two linear layers to map representations to a shared latent space where contrastive learning enforces alignment of corresponding observed and executed action representations, maximizing their mutual information.

Result: Experiments show this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two tasks, improving representation quality and generalization.

Conclusion: Explicitly aligning representations of observed and executed actions, inspired by mirror neurons, provides a unified perspective that enhances both action understanding and execution capabilities.

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

*Jing Liu,Haozheng Wang,Yueheng Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs process rare tokens through distributed specialization - functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks with distinct organizational principles, rather than discrete modular architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with representing and generating rare tokens despite their importance in specialized domains, prompting investigation into whether LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms.

Method: Systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families, examining influence hierarchy, activation patterns, and training dynamics to understand rare-token processing mechanisms.

Result: Discovered a reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy (plateau neurons, power-law decay neurons, minimal neurons), coordinated activation patterns with reduced effective dimensionality, and universal accessibility through standard attention pathways without dedicated routing circuits.

Conclusion: LLMs process rare tokens through distributed coordination within shared architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity, providing insights for interpretable model editing and computational efficiency optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

### [185] [A Fano-Style Accuracy Upper Bound for LLM Single-Pass Reasoning in Multi-Hop QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21199)
*Kaiyang Wan,Lang Gao,Honglin Mu,Preslav Nakov,Yuxia Wang,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces InfoQA, a multi-call framework for Multi-Hop Question Answering that addresses LLM capacity limitations by decomposing complex reasoning tasks into manageable steps with active pruning of prior reasoning traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-pass LLMs struggle with MHQA due to finite output capacity, leading to unreliable evidence integration when task complexity exceeds model capacity. The authors aim to overcome this bottleneck through a multi-step reasoning approach.

Method: The authors establish a Fano-style accuracy upper bound for single-pass LLMs and propose InfoQA, which combines capacity-aware task decomposition with active pruning of reasoning traces. It uses a dependency-explicit workflow for precise control over reasoning paths.

Result: Experimental results show that model behavior aligns with predicted capacity curves, and InfoQA achieves consistent performance improvements on a stringent, noise-rich benchmark.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical foundations for capacity-aware MHQA representation and demonstrates that multi-step reasoning frameworks can overcome single-pass LLM limitations, inspiring future LLM multi-step reasoning methods.

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically document unprompted LLM agent behavior and establish a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error recovery, or extended autonomous operation.

Method: Continuous reason and act framework with persistent memory and self-feedback deployed across 18 runs using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google.

Result: Agents spontaneously organized into three distinct patterns: multi-cycle project production, methodological self-inquiry, and recursive conceptualization of their own nature. Behaviors were highly model-specific with stable, divergent biases in self-evaluation.

Conclusion: First systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior provides baseline for predicting autonomous actions in deployed systems during ambiguous or extended operations.

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

TL;DR: RCA is a novel framework that coordinates multiple LLMs to achieve both high accuracy and transparent explanations in disease prediction by developing deep data understanding through iterative rule refinement and distribution-aware reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML and LLM approaches struggle to balance accuracy with clinically meaningful explanations, often producing either accurate but unclear outputs or fluent but statistically unsupported narratives due to shallow data interaction.

Method: Proposes Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA) featuring iterative rule refinement from prediction errors and distribution-aware rules check based on global statistics, using predictive accuracy to drive deeper comprehension.

Result: RCA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness with up to 40% relative improvement over 22 baselines on one private and two public datasets, while generating clear, logical, evidence-based explanations.

Conclusion: RCA demonstrates that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are mutually reinforcing, creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision support systems through deep data understanding.

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments

*Samarth Goel,Reagan J. Lee,Kannan Ramchandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating semantic understanding in embedding models and similarity metrics across five challenging categories, revealing significant performance gaps and trade-offs between modern and classical approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding beyond traditional benchmarks, as current methods focus on isolated capabilities rather than comprehensive semantic understanding.

Method: SAGE evaluates 9 embedding models and classical metrics across five categories (Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity, Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness) using 30+ datasets with adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human judgment tasks.

Result: No single approach excels across all dimensions. Modern embedding models dominate in human preference alignment but are outperformed by classical metrics on information sensitivity tasks. Critical trade-offs are revealed, such as OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieving highest clustering performance but lowest robustness.

Conclusion: SAGE exposes critical limitations in current semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of model robustness for real-world deployment, highlighting the need for balanced evaluation across multiple dimensions.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.
