Here we present a natural language processing (NLP)\nscreening tool to detect high-severity incident reports in radiation oncology\nacross two institutions.\n  METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used two text datasets to train and evaluate our\nNLP models: 7,094 reports from our institution (Inst.), and 571 from IAEA\nSAFRON (SF), all of which had severity scores labeled by clinical content\nexperts. We trained and evaluated two types of models: baseline support vector\nmachines (SVM) and BlueBERT which is a large language model pretrained on\nPubMed abstracts and hospitalized patient data. We assessed for\ngeneralizability of our model in two ways. First, we evaluated models trained\nusing Inst.-train on SF-test. Second, we trained a BlueBERT_TRANSFER model that\nwas first fine-tuned on Inst.-train then on SF-train before testing on SF-test\nset. To further analyze model performance, we also examined a subset of 59\nreports from our Inst. dataset, which were manually edited for clarity.\n  RESULTS Classification performance on the Inst. test achieved AUROC 0.82\nusing SVM and 0.81 using BlueBERT. Without cross-institution transfer learning,\nperformance on the SF test was limited to an AUROC of 0.42 using SVM and 0.56\nusing BlueBERT.
